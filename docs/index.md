## Things related to my work as a 'Digital Drop In' at the State Library of NSW's [DXLab](http://dxlab.sl.nsw.gov.au/)

*The Tribune* was a newspaper published by the Communist Party of Australia. The State Library of NSW holds more than 60,000 negatives and photos from the *Tribune* which document a wide range of political events and social issues from 1964 to 1991.

Here's the [top-level record](http://archival.sl.nsw.gov.au/Details/archive/110037137) for the Tribune collection. I think I'll be working with Series 1-4 which contain the negatives. While many of the negatives have been digitised, only a selection are currently available online. Here's some examples:

* [Tribune negatives of anti-Vietnam War demonstrations, including Australia's first sit down demonstration, Sydney, and a protest outside Central Police Court, Liverpool Street, Sydney, New South Wales, 1965](http://archival.sl.nsw.gov.au/Details/archive/110366605)
* [Tribune negatives including protests against development in Woolloomooloo, and Student Action for Aborigines fundraising folk concert at Paddington Town Hall, Sydney, New South Wales, 1965](http://archival.sl.nsw.gov.au/Details/archive/110370048)
* [Tribune negatives including the Freedom Rides SAFA (Student Action For Aboriginals) Trip 17- 26 February, 1965](http://archival.sl.nsw.gov.au/Details/archive/110366670)

To find all the digitised items you can go to the [Advanced Search](http://archival.sl.nsw.gov.au/search/advanced) page, search for title keywords "Tribune negatives", and check the "digital content" box.
