For convenience I've created a [list of items](negatives/digitised_items/) with digitised images available.

## Metadata

As a first step, I've been working at getting metadata relating to the Tribune collection out of the catalogue and into a form I can do something with.

Here's a CSV-formatted list of [all the series](https://github.com/wragge/dxlab-tribune/tree/master/negatives/csv/tribune_series.csv) in the Tribune collection.

In [this folder](https://github.com/wragge/dxlab-tribune/tree/master/negatives/csv/) you'll also find CSV-formatted lists of all items in series 1 - 4. For example, here's the items in [Series 1 Part 1](https://github.com/wragge/dxlab-tribune/tree/master/negatives/csv/series-01-part-01-items.csv).

## Word frequencies

I've started some preliminary playing around with the [frequencies of words and phrases](negatives/title_word_frequencies/) in item titles.

## Subjects

* [Subject frequencies](negatives/subjects/)
* [Topic frequencies](negatives/topics/)
* [People &amp; organisation frequencies](negatives/people/)
* [Places](negatives/places/)
