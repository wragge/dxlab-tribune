As well as exploring the negatives, I'm going to see what connections can be made to other collections.

Trove includes the [Sydney *Tribune*](http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/title/1002) from 1939 to 1954 and issues for the next two decades are in the [process of being added](http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/result?l-title=1002&q&l-decade=196). This means there'll be a nice overlap to explore between the negatives and the newspapers.

I've fired up my TroveHarvester and grabbed details of the 28,493 post 1954 articles currently listed on Trove. Note that a lot of these are 'Coming soon' -- so you can't actually get to the articles. But articles from 1965 and 1966 are fully available online. You can grab a [CSV file with all the harvested articles here](https://github.com/wragge/dxlab-tribune/tree/master/trove/data/1496625055/results.csv).

A number of the protests and rallies documented by the Tribune were also the subject of ASIO surveillance. I've previously harvested [details of publicly-available ASIO files](https://github.com/wragge/asio-files) from the National Archives of Australia. It'll be interesting to compare perspectives...
