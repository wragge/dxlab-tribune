 Protest wins apology J RECENTLY wrote a letter to radio station 2UW objecting to the re marks of one of their announcers, Mr. Robert Kennedy. His opening words were "Heil Hitler". I received the following letter in reply, proving that protests do get results. F. D. Abbot, Campsie, Sydney. Mr. F. D. Abbott, 143 Brighton Ave., C'MPSIE, N.S.W. ?ar Sir, Referring to your letter of 14th inst. you are assured that the words "Heil Hitler" which' were broadcast on Monday morning last were said in an attempt to be light-hearted, and in no way was it considered that these words would be interpreted as being serious. 1 So far as management is concerned, we consider the jest to be a little unfortunate. In point of fact the reference to "Heil Hitler" was tied in with a station pointer that had been broadcast a few seconds earlier and was a deliberate attempt tr be funny. ' -parently it was a poor jest and we are sorry if it upset you. F. R. Jeffcoat, Manager.
