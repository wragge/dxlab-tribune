 Australian language y£R. E. J. Baker has received a £2,000 literary grant to bring his work on the Australian language up to date. 4 People who are seeking an under- ; standing of "Why the Australian Difference?" should get in early on this work as it is certain to be sold out early. (Baker's first edition of "The Aus tralian Language" has been out of print, for many years). Even Menzies has been forced to admit, despite his bourgeois loyal ties, that we are saddled with this (relatively) new language and he's usually the last to wake up. The Folk Lore Societies and acade mic researchers have a vital interest in Baker's work and also a respon sibility to held enrich it. Already there has been some ef forts made by them but little that the community as a whole can ac knowledge as due to their labour. This will remain for some time until professionals understand the reality that folk are indeed practis ing their lore while they (the pro fessionals) are interpreting it to suit their own fancies — Edgar Waters, Ian Turner, Rex Mortimer and others notwithstanding. Of our contemporary writers only Alan Marshall has any real under standing and. even he draws the line, apparently in endeavours to please everyone which, of course, is impos- ciKIp in rnnitnlist snniet.v.
