His Prime Minister was Jaroslav Stetzko. That independent State existed only six weeks, but during this short period 5,000 Ukrainians, several thousand Poles and 15,000 Jews were slaughtered by the agents of Bandera and Stetzko. "If however Ukrainians arid Poles were killed as political enemies, the Jews were murdered by these dis ciples of Hitler solely as Jews. In the secret archives of the Ges tapo we find a favourable appraisal of their activities." Nicholas Czerbatyj, former Pro fessor at the Greek "Catholic Theo logical Academy at Lvov published in the U.S. journal of Central-Euro pean Affairs an article which speaks of the horrors these Nazi collabora tors Bandera and Stetzko committed. From time to time it is announced in the Australian press that visitors or appointees to university posts are not allowed to come into Australia. The reasons given are mostly security reasons My organisation has asked the Government and its security organi sation the question: Is a Nazi collaborator and active fascist who has a record of actively indulging in racialism and pro-Hitler propaganda a welcome visitor to this country and does the Government regard his work among migrants in the best interest of democracy? My organisation protests again giv ing Mr. Stetzko who has such a record a possibility to continue in Australia the work he started in 1941. He is an anti-semite and a man who does not believe in democracy and has no place in this country even as a visitor.
