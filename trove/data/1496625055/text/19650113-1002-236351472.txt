 Ira I Gilmore award | to Hardy play i "THE Committee of the Mary Gil- P ' more Award has announced that I the judges of the 1964 Mary Gil- I more Award for a three-act play 1 (John Clark, nominated by the I Elizabethan Trust, and John Gray, I nominated by New Theatre) have I submitted the following judgement: :| "We declare 'the Ringbolter' by Frank Hardy -the winner, with this iij reservation: that the play has excel- |! lent potential, but needs revision by the author working in conjunction with a professional director. ('The Ringbolter' was, in fact, given a successful professional reading by the Old Tote theatre in 1964, and has already had some revision by the author. ) "We recommend 'This Old Man Came Rolling Home' by Dorothy Hewett as a play of considerable merit, which may, with revision and professional assistance be well worth putting into production." The Mary Gilmore Centenary Award of Â£500 for a novel will close on Feb ruary 1, 1965. Conditions of entry may be obtained by letter to Box 32, Trades Hall, Goulburn Street, Sydney. .
