 | NEW YEAR GIFT I | TO MONOPOLIES I ! ADELAIDE: Premier Play ford has begun ! 1965 in the same consistent way as previous years, I by announcing a New Year's gift to the mono- J I polies of his State- f ! iN his New Year message he I anounced cheaper electrical I powc- for large industries and | a promise of further assistance 1 of the State to major industrial | undertakings. | Song and dance I By making a song and dauce about cheaper power rates to domestic country consumers the | Premier has tried to hide the i fact that the overwhelming | majority of the working people I will not benefit from improve- | ments in power production. iThe country concessions will affect only 80,000 consumers in a State of a million people. | The main reduction would ap- !ply to large industries in both the metropolitan and country I areas. | Those who will benefit the most are the monopoly enter- ! prises like B.H.P. (with its new | steel plant being built at Why- U, â€” alia), G.M.H., Chryslers, I.C.I., j and others who already have re- 1 - ceived tremendous assistance I from the L.C.L. Government. | Playford has also foreshadow- j ed further industrialisation of 1 South Australia ("the success 1 so far achieved at Whyalla indi- I rates that S.A. will become the j structural steel centre of Aus- I tralia", he said. I i Industries At least two major industries j v. ould be established. g This is the result of secret | negotiations with monopolies I which can only continue the j policy of selling the State re- I sources to big business. 1 The State elections to be held I in early March, however, can j provide the opportunity for the 1 people of ' this State to reject | such unpopular policies by re- | moving this rich man's govern- | ment from office.
