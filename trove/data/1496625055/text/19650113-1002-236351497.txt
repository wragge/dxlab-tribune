 Belgian Press j admits possible | defeat in Congo I "|T must be consid ered as probable that the whole of the Congo, including Leo- poldville, will shortly fall into the hands of the rebels", says Bel gium's official news I agency in a sensation- ! al admission- It was presented in the form of a statement by a "Belgian personality liv ing- in the Congo capital". But the London Daily Worker says there is no doubt that it meant a leading Belgian adviser to Premier Tshombe. The "rebels" are the Congo i liberation forces led by Mr. Gbenye and other supporters of j the late Congo Premier Patrice j Lumumba who was murdered in : 1961 according to an official j United Nations report, in the j presence of Tshombe. | The Belgium news agency re- ! port saysâ€” "The regions occuci- j ed by Gbenye's men are well | held. The ANC troops iTshom- be's men), who are operating g there are melting away l-ike wax I in the sun and their morale is g bad." i The statement coincides with S the resolution of the UN | Security Council calling on all I States to keep their hands off = the Congo. | France abstained from voting J on the resolution, the other. 10 g Council members voted for it 1 including, America, Britain and | the Soviet Union, after a long | and heated debate in which | the USSR and African states | exposed the western interven- jj tion. | All Council members including f France voted for inclusion of | the paragraph: "Requests all g States to refrain or desist from I intervening in the domestic jj affairs of the Congo." g Tsliombe's representative =j opposed withdrawal of the mer- | cenaries and the US delegate, g Mr. Adlai Stevenson, said that s when the resolution "deplored \ the recent events in the Congo". | this did not apply to the Bel- j gain-American action in drop- \ ping paratroops on Stanleyville.
