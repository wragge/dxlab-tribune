 Top union leader of preferences gYDNEY: "The most demo cratic system of parliament ary election is proportional re presentation without any pre- ference allocation," Mr. T. Wright, an ex-City Alderman, said last night in Sydney. Mr. Wright, a Communist alderman from 1953 to 1959, was commenting on the re-count of the Senate voting in Victoria. "This case has Shown that when the voting is close the final result can be determined by chance," he said. Mr. Wright explained that the pre sent system of Senate election is a mixture of proportional representa tion and prefere-ce voting. "A fantastic situation can arise where the preferences of anti- Liberal voters can determine the elec tion of a Liberal or vice-versa." "The most democratic system of proportional representation would give each political party the same percentage of seats in parliament as votes cast for that party," Mr. Wright said. He said that under this system the voters vote for the party of their choice, not candidates, and then the various parties select their en titled representatives. "If this system operated in Aus- tralia for the election of the House of Representatives, all the political parties would be represented," he said. In explanation, Mr. Wright said that if 100 seats were being contested and the Communist Party polled four per Cent of the votes cast, then that party would be entitled to four represen tatives. This method exists in such coun tries as Italy and Prance although in f-e latter the system has been varied to allow for alliances of par ties. This was done for the purpose of denying the Communist Party of France its proper representation. Mr. Wright explained that he had been elected to the Sydney City Council under the system of propor tional representation. He was excluded from the Council only after it was split up into five wards.
