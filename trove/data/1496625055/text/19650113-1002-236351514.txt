 j _ j Newpoiv folk | concert I J"HE Newport Folk Festival j held last weekend gave an- l other crashing emphasis to the I demand of a large section of j Australian youth for a genuine j culture. I The week-end concerts were packed | and on Saturday night over 2000 well- ? behaved young people filled the tent ! to capacity. I Seasoned performers at the concert I like Marian Henderson, Glen Tovca- | setti, Martin Wyndham-Reade and | Brian Mooney excelled themselves. I | New singers like Jean Lewis made | impressive "debuts", I The quality and Tange of the songs S extended from Ireland of 200 years J ago right round the world through | the intervening years and up to Gary I Shearston's present-day song about | conscription in Australia. | "The Galahs", the three singing j Grivas brothers (who were far from I being "galahs" at singing) gave the S show a" strong link with 'the tradi- | tional Australian ballads. J The audience, which joined in | choruses and hand-clapping rhythms, | demonstrated marked appreciation I for protest songs about burning mod- ern problems like World peace | racial equality.- -D.K.
