 Actors win union stable" CYDNEY ; About 80 actors and musicians who picketed a theatre last Thursday at Pad- dington (above) succeeded in obtaining a full union cast. Actors and Announcers' Eq uity and the Musicians' Union decided to picket the show "Stable of Stars" produced by the Le Garde Twins after it was learned that most of the cast was non-union. Last Wednesday a represen tative of the show told an Equity oroaniser that the mem bers of the cast would not be required to join their respective union, as it "was their own personal affair". Following the action taken by the two unions the show is now a "union stable".
