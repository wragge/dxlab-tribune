 [?] | QNE wonders at the j a muddled thinking j j of TV executives who j I do not arrange t>ro- I grammes to their best I advantage. Every even- \ ing they try to hold | the attention of view- ! ers by presenting their J | best programmes in j | competition with each j j other. j i It is ridiculous to ex- | j pect the public to tie it- | | self to one channel each 2 j evening. The best pro- j 1 grammes should be slot- 1 j ted in -harmony and not ! j in competition. I | The favourite pastime of view- j I ers is dial twisting in the hope j S of obtaining two or three hours' j | worthwhile entertr' nent. I | nmercial channels especial- j I ly should wake up to themselves j ! and take advantage of the I I catholic taste of audiences and | of'er a wider variety of har- j S monising viewing. | I The Sunday night play from j j Channel 2 on January 10 was j | another example of the high | j standard of work achieved by j | our expatriates- in the entertain- I | ment world. j S "Thirty-one Backyards" was 2 ) written by Alan Seymour (well- | I known for his prize- winning | S "The One Day of the Year"), i I and produced by Raymond S Menmuir who was established j I in production in Australia be- j | fore leaving for England. Ray S | Barrett, who- was a well-known I 1 actor before taking the almost j j inevitable trip overseas, was s j excellent in the leading role. I !The play, a competent and en- j tertaining observation on some j aspects of the British character ' and way of life, took an amus- I | ing stab at exploding the myth | that all Australian men are tall, j bronzed gods. | ! The production and direction I | were very good indeed. These use- | ful three artists will probably re- - S main overseas until sufficient j I work is available here. \ | January 1965 should be called ! | the month of repeats. The 1 S three Sydney channels are | | wearing out the film prints 1 | with constant re-showing. Chil- ! ! dren and adults alike must be | | getting pretty fed up with this i i3 state of affairs. ! Where are the programmes \ promised to us some months | ago? Are they being kept on ice = | until Channel 10 opens. I I T constant repetition of I i some advertisements is another j . aspect of bad programming. A I I new brand of cigarettes was be- j j ing promoted and the ad. was i | shown five times in 60 minutes 1 I on Channel 7 and a switch to l I Channel 9 revealed the same ' ! borine commercial I | EILEEN ALLISON. j
