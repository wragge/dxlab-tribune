 [?] DELAIDE: Port Adelaide wharf ies have won a victory on safety.. With typical disregard for life and limb, the shipowners had failed to carry out the practice of lashing bags of flour to the loading pallets. Wheri some bags fell into the hold of the freighter Rhexener at num ber 17 berth, waterside workers asked for all bags to be lashed, as had been carried out in the port previously. The request was agreed to, but a number of slings were not attended to, and an instruction was given that no more lashings were to be used. The men stopped work and forced | the shipowners to attend to all slings. Bags will now be lashed, until some other method of loading is introduced with the agreement of the wharf ies. The dispute reveals two things: the good spirit of unity and mili tancy now existing on the Adelaide waterfront and the callous disre gard of. normal safety measurec by profit hungry employers. Footnote â€” Other reports indi cate that a special investigation into safety matters would not go amiss on the waterfront. A ship's derrick crashed onto number 8 wharf, and wharfies had to run for their lives. During the night shift a derrick crashed at another hold on the | same ship.
