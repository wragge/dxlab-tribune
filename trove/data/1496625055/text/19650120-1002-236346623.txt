 [?] [?] yHEN my father, a shell- shocked veteran of lorld War I, took his life jm 1934 he left a widow / i i . -r-r « itn tour cniiaren. ie was p2 years of age. H My sister and I were at p-hool. My two toothers, aged 18 and 20 IfyearS, were unemployed. :$ During World War II, one work ed in war industry. The other was |fponscripted and subsequently join ed the A.I.F. ;>r Like my father before him this -tlboy found the rigours of the war !&lt;ttoo much. It killed his capacity to. 'Sstoeefc and face life with courage, as jfeurely as a .bullet can kill more ifswiftly a whole human being. He %ied last year at the age of 47. Today his son, my sister's son and "tniy son are eligible for conscription 'Sethis year. All are good citizens. None Ifhave the loutish characteristics Slanderously ascribed to modern ;;|youth by the press and confused ifpeople who claim the army will ||f straighten out" young lads; Nor have any of them any faith |ln the Government's so-called "de- ||fence" plans — plans for an . in- Ifdoctrination of hatred towards our Ajfiorthern neighbours, as preparation .-to send our sons to fight and kill Hither mothers' sons, and even :i|tvomen and children. Even as 'the Government tries to /destroy the best in our boys, a tele vision series on World War I re peals for all to see the senseless de struction of war. y| .1 Peace organisations and the Labor llMovement have strong traditions of ;fanti-war action in our country. The ||communist Party, in addition, ex- '.|poses the cause of wars— capitalism, -j|big business, with its suppression of peoples to profit from them, with its ;|de.sperate fear that the Socialist Jpeace-loving nations will show to g. he world that people can live in ifpeace and friendship with increas ing prosperity. Nearly all Australian families #iave suffered some destruction of ;|family life and loved ones through . - ifvars, even though we haven't had ||var on our soil. The imminence of conscription ;|plans and our Government's aggres siveness in Asia should, therefore, Upompel us to mightier efforts to ||orce a change in its foreign policy .|and a halt to army call-ups, .;>|p specially for overseas service. H Mothers like myself can work with fthe many youth who are opposed :|to the Government's war plans. Angry criticism is growing in ail countries of British policy in Maiay- |sia arid U.S. policy in Vietnam. This and their own intelligence convinces ' our young people that Jjheir stake is not in war with Asia, ffcut in a policy of peace and friend ship between Australia and our , Jriorthern neighbours.
