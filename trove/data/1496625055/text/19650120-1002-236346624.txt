 Conscription giR ROBERT MENZIES should be the last one in Australia to conscript our lads to go over seas. During World War I he was a Lieutenant but resigned his commis sion and did not go overseas. Mr. Menzies was elected on a mandate to win World War II but gave ' it up after only a third of his term. Labor, which governed with a minority in both Houses, inherited 250,000 unemployed and an empty Treasury. By the splendid leadership of Labor the unemployed were placed in jobs within a few months. Under the preceding Liberal Gov ernments most of the unemployed up to the age of 24 years had not had a job since leaving school and were on a miserable dole of 4s. lOd. a week. ' Children up to the age of 14 years received only 2s. 5d. a week. This meant that parents had to starve in order to allow their chil- dren to exist amid plenty. The war had been raging for two years before Labor took over. Some soldiers at' the time were being trained with' broomsticks on the banks of the Torrens River (S.A.). Little progress had been made towards the war effort. Then, as now, the Menzies Gov ernment was in a military muddle and in a financial and political dilemma. The Menzies Government has turned so many somersaults that they do not know whether they are on their feet or up in the air. â€” E. C. Bowers, 18 Revell Street, Port Pirie West, S.A. W
