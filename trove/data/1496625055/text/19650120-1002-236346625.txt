 "Lucky Country" -jpmBUNE'S references to Donald Home's "Lucky Country" - could be described as niggardly. , In fact, after saying that the author is a right-winger, Tribune judges the book accordingly. The political label may fit, but it could scarcely be described as a book review. In my belief, Home is no more attempting to prove radicalism than Father J. P. Kelly when he criticised a citadel of the chruch — Roman Catholic schools. _ , Both see perils ahead for their social and religious system. Automation, Home believes, will bring a host of troubles for Aus tralian capitalists because of their hillbilly attitude to education and denial of theory (business execu tives who never read a book).. All this, he moans, is made infini tely worse with the domination of politics by Menzies since 1949. Nothing Menzies has done has really seemed to matter. Menzies falls short of what Home describes as — a conservative esti mate of leadership. It is in his treatrrient of the labour movement and trade unions that the limitations of his class outlook are evident. I believe the book has some merit for communists. In any case, when Tribune reviews a book it should be kept free of the unbalanced approach. B.D. (Dalfram).
