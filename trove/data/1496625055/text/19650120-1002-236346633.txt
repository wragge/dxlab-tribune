 Record earnings justify wage claims ADELAIDE: Record earnings by the SA railways clearly shows the justice of the claims of railwaymen for increased wage and extra leave as well as the need for cheaper fares for the travelling public. This is revealed in the annual re port of the Railways Commissioner. The record £14,800,000 is nearly £1,000,000 more than last year, despite heavy freight concessions to big business. During the year the Playford Gov ernment increased fares to the travel ling public, virtually making the people subsidise the monoplies. Clear proof of the ability f the Railways to pay was. that profit earnings over working expenses total led £825,000. Two serious derailments of freight trains in the last two weeks also point to the failure of the Govern ment to pay proper attention to track maintenance. This is not only a direct threat to train crews who are working excessive hours on much greater loadings but is a potential danger to passenger trains which, in the event of an accident, could lead to con siderable loss of life. These latest disclosures will help the campaign to move Playford from office in March of this year.
