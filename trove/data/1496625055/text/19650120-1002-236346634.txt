 [?] [?] iii CECTIONS of the daily press were busy last week stirring i up more conflict in connection with the national leader- || !: ship of the Australian Labor Party. i| In most cases they continued the "dump Calwell" line jf ij: fostered energetically since the December Senate election, ;;; with the aim of moving the ALP to the Right. || What is behind this? Essentia! to finding the answer ;| is the fact that the dominant, highly integrated monopoly ::: groups in control of the Australian press are NOT con- i| cerned to see "better leadership" or electoral success for I? :: the Labor Party. What is going on is a struggle over ALP policy, cover- || i:i ing attitude to monopoly, to the Democratic Labor Party, to g Iii: trade union unity and at present particularly to foreign a policy. V H :3: One policy line is that of "reliance on force", bigger 2 I:: and better armed force, in resolving the serious problems g ::: of relations between Australia and the people of Vietnam. 8 China, North Borneo, Indonesia, etc. This is the line of g IS; the Men zies Government, major organs of the press, leaders ft ;;; of the Democratic Labor Party, and rightwingers among the 11 IS: ALP leadership and in the trade unions. || Si This group of forces seeks to use the ALP to tie most 8 IS; of the labor movement to its war policy. 8 IS; The other essential policy is that the true security and || I Si well-being of the Australian people can be ensured ONLY jf IS! through an active policy of solving these problems through ij SI support of national independence and through peaceful ne- g ISI gotiation, the display of mutual respect, and the aim of |j :S| genuine friendship with our Asian neighbours. Â« ISI This policy has at all times been advocated by the Com- |j ill I munists. It conforms to the interests of all the labor 8 ISI movement and indeed most people throughout Australia. |: IS; The Labor Party leadership, too, last week took valuable g IS. initiative with a proposal for a new approach to the Malaysia fj IS; problem, including guarantees of the sovereign independ- g IS ence of Indonesia. II |:; But useful as this can be, it does not alter the ALP's tj ill basic foreign policy line of tailing behind the United States II I; in SE Asia, which in practice means support of the intol- -g |; erable crime of the American Australian war of intervention g |: in Vietnam. \ 2 |; Not only in Australia but internationally, and signifi- | I ; cantly in the USA itself, the struggle is rising to halt the g |; latest US aggressive strikes against Laos and North Vietnam jj I; and to end the entire war. 8 |; Only new policy measures with these aims can bring jj I: the ALP leadership into tune with the real needs of the H |; Australian people at this moment. . jj
