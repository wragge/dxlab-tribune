I This money is being pirated by the giant overseas shipping | combines, it is a loss which is | helping growing problems in 2 Australia's trade balances (see S Page 9). | Miller's coastal tankers have | recently proved that Australian ! owned and manned vessels can j compete with the overseas j monopolies. 1 As long ago as the 1920's there I was a flourishing Australian i overseas merchant fleet. This fleet was sold to overseas ship- I owners by the Bruce-Page Gov- I ernment. !
