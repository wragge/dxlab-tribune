 flflf j JH JtjoL With Tribune's Industrial Roundsman THAT law unto itself, the BHP, has again jacked up the price of steel. The increase by about 30/- a ton for almost all steel was quieuy in troduced on January, 11 . . . of course' no court hearings were neces- sary! According to the Australian: "It appears that the rise' is aimed at financing the company's plans for ex pansion from excess profits." As this is the second increase in the past 12 months . (the last being £3 a ton last February) it would also APPEAR that the time is NOW to nationalise this monopoly. Such a move would benefit Aus tralian . producers as well as the workers. : ? . . A S we go to press, 3,000 workers A from the BHP's steel and ship building plant at. Whyalla in South Australia are on strike over a general wage claim of £5 per week. Thf stonnaee was called after several unsuccessful attempts last year to negotiate with the company on this claim. The workers seem to think they are entitled to a small part of the "ex cess profits" to expand the family budget. ? A CCORDING to reports Major Hoare's mercenaries (mainly recruited in South Africa and Rhode sia" to slaughter the Congolese people) are oh strike because the puppet Government of Tshombe owes them three months' pay. This is one strike most Australian unionists would support . . . not for the back pay. of blood money, BUT THAT THE STRIKE CONTINUES INDEFINITELY. - " ?
