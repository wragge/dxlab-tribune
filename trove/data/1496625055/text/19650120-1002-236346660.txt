After all, he is the man next door," said Mr. Tim Donnelly, President of the ACT Trades and Labor Council, in a broadcast. Mr. Donnelly said Australians should "go their own way and not be the lackeys and fall guys for a capricious Tunku- or- for the cowboy- and-Indian style U.S. foreign policy of propping up the feudal east Asian anti-democratic regimes."
