 [?] By JUNE MILLS MOT only does Butch Whart- "on, of Newcastle, collec.t money for Tribune fund, he writes and tells of his exper- iences. When sending his donation last week he wrote that a mate of his gave him £1 In appreciation of the short story, "Workers' Train." He collected 16/- on his street stand and to make the even £2 sent 4/- donation himself. Butch also wrote to Tribune about an experience he had selling the paper: "About three weeks ago I sold a -Trib. to a student The other day he came up and said, 'I want three this time, two for my friends'. Not bad, eh?" This is the kind of work that builds Tribune, sales and will help us reach our £1500 target. I'd like to hear from many more sellers about their experiences in collecting for the fund.
