 I : j | Why 'ban women I cabbies ? i j "HE Transport Depart- ) ment in NSW has re - j fused to grant woman taxi- 1 cab licences "except in | very special circum- 2 stances". | I What would be the nature of ' | those circumstances? I If women drove taxis during t a manpower shortage surely | they are entitled to know the i reasons why they cannot do so j now. j # j J BRITISH dentist states that | brushing the teeth has no I effect on "bad breath and tooth I decay", to quote the splurge | l'rom a well-known TV advt. | He recommends diet to moth- l ers to ensure healthy teeth for $ their children. $ Question is, will we continue | to see that hurt, stricken little ! girl rejected by her boy friends \ and that old smoothie "dentist" 1 assuring her that unpopularity = will be a thing of the past IF $ etc. . . Of course we will. | The advts linking smoking with glamour and sport still S remain, so will the equally inane 1 toothpaste ones unless parents | reject them vigorously and pub- i licly with as much sound and | fury as the advertising agencies I use to sell their sponsors' pro- = ducts. | j (CONGRATULATIONS to "The | Australian" newspaper and | Betty Collins, author . of the I article which appeared- last week S under the title "Trapped in | Hell's Kitchen". | The present struggle in Mt.

Contrast this with the situa tion in the Soviet Union, first socialist country. There, people are being re housed at the rate of 10 million, a year. Rents vary from 4 to 6 per cent of the joint family income. This rent includes gas, light and central heating, the latter an expensive item on account of the long, severe Russian win ter. But,- of course, loan sharks and rapacious landlords are looked upon as enemies of so ciety in the Soviet Union, as indeed they are. Here they are treated more like -pets and allow ed to flourish.
