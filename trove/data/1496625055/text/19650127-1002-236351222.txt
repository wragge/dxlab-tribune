 : &lt; _AST week saw the com- jri.:/.eement of three new series programs. On Wed- nesday, January 29, from Channel 9 at 7 p.m:- The , Addams Family" and at 7.30 p.m. "My Living Doll". On Saturday, Jan uary 23, from Channel 7, the new Australian series "Homicide". "The Addams Family" is advertised as "a half-hour comedy series based on the unique and humorously ma cabre characters created by the famous cartoonist Charles Addams." In essence it is sick humour typical of much American culture today. . Together with its companion pro gram "The Munsters" it presents monstrosities in . human form and asks us to accept them and their act- tions as amusing entertainment. Basically "The Addams Family" (and "The Munsters") violate normal conceptions of decency and morality. "My Living Doll", another American program, follows "The Addams Family" immediately on Channel 9. This program is mentioned briefly to point up the level of idiocy to which story and values can sink. A scientist creates a robot and gives it the form of a beautiful girl. Her adventures with her young ' guardian, a fellow scientist, follow ' the usual pattern of juvenile eroti cism so beloved of American TV writers. They seem unable to handle the genre of science fiction intelli gently. "Homicide" an Australian crime series has replaced "The Avengers" on Saturday at 8.30 p.m. A Melbourne production, it has been showing in that city since October last year and is said to have become the third most popular show. It will need to improve on last Saturday's episode, but this Austra lian series deserves further watch ing. 71 is a pity that the quality of ths opening sequence was not main tained throughout; the direction was . far too casual for thriller. Sotm. Fegan and Terry McDer- Tribtt, who play the two senior detec tives, are actors who can be relied ftpon to give strength to future episodes. â€”EILEEN ALLISON.
