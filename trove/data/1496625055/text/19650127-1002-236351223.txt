 ti® forced saltl | 'Loo fight ! for homes i | SYDNEY: A number of 1 slogans draped from the ba3- I conies of V/oolfoomooloo I homes last week formed the | opening salvo of the local | residents' protest to a pro- | posed re-development i scheme. S The proposed scheme will be car- | ried out by a wealthy English In- | vestment Trust (The Hakeybridge | Investment Trust Limited of East- I cheap, London). | The company- has submitted to j the State Government an £82 million | plan to re-develop 67 acres at Wool- I Ioomoolo bounded by Victoria Street, | William Street,. Sir John Young | Crescent and Cowper Wharf Road. | The local residents rightly see | themselves as the unfortunate vic- | tims of_big business. There are very many people in the I area who have struggled and sacri- I ficed to purchase their own homes j and there is no guarantee that they | will even be paid the current V.G. I for their homes. | Mrs. Val Sharman, Secretary of the « Woolloomooloa Progress Associa- I tion said: "I think the whole scheme i as outlined in the daily papers is a | farce and will finish as a collabora- | tion between the existing big business I firms of the area and the developers. | I can't see the likes of them having | their interests interfered with."
