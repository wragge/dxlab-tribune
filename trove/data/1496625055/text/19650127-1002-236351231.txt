 Union Milko i i A NEW pair of suede shoes, ; trousers straight from the cleaners and a nice white shirt j and I was ready for the picnic. i It was my union picmc and cf j course all the members were ex- ! pected to do some little job to make | it run smoothly — see that the | wives and kiddies had a good time ! My job was to look after the milk. The shining aluminium con tainer had a tap that turned on and off both ways. The container had to be filled from the big cans used by the milk distributors. Everything went fairly smoothly, even thought I was beginning to get tired of filling jugs and billy cans brought along py the women and kids. But then along came a pretty young lass with a bottle. "Will you fill this for me," she said. "I can't manage to fill a bottle from this tap", I told her. But my young son took the bottle and said "I'll fill it." "'Be careful, boy", I told him, thinking of my new suede shoes and nicely pressed pants. "I'll be alright, dad", and he turned on the tap, first this way and then that and the milk poured out all over my shoes. Well, you know what milk does to suede. Those shoes have never been worn since. Uqion .picnics are great — . a day out for'-all the members, their wives and children. But in future my job will be to look after the keg — I know how to manage that tap! — sueue.
