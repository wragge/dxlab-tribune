Mi' Gibson, who represented the Commmiist Party of Australia, caid that the presence at the Con gress of fraternal delegations of 24 communist parties and greetings from some 25 others, expressed a very wide and powerful internation al Communist solidarity. The Congress had met following very big mass struggles, led by the Party, on the issues of food and prices. The power of these struggles was reflected in the mass rally of 150,000 in Bombay in honor of the Congress, following workers' . marches from all over the city. The Congress which showed deep basic unity, adopted a new Party program, calling for the formation of a national democratic front of all patriotic and progressive forces and for a struggle to replace the capitalist by the non-capitalst path of development in India.
