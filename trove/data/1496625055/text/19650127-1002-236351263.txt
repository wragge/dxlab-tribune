 : And Whyalla men fight for more pay ADELAIDE: Three thousand workers employed by BHP at Whyalla held a 24- hour stop page last week in protest at the refusal of the company to grant a £5 a week bonus. A mass meeting of the men unani- mously condemned the Company's attitude in refusing to negotiate with accredited representatives of the SA Trades and Labor Council and the Combined Union Council of Whyalla. The meeting gave the TLC. and the CUC authority to take action if the Company again refuses to meet its representatives. In November last year the Combin ed Union Council of Whyalla had de cided to call a 24 hour stoppage of 1 all BHP workers. This was subsequently deferred' on. ; the proposal of the TLC to allow the Company time to reply to the de mand for a £5 bonus for all : employees. In their usual arrogant manner tha. Company then refused to meet re- i presentatives of the TLC for fur- : ther negotiations. Neither do/they ra» cognise the CUC- of Whyalla. A series of lunch hour meetings attended by over 1,900 workers eoii demned th Company for its attitude and recommended further action. While the BHP refuses to grant wage justice to its workers or even . negotiate wih leading' trade union i bodies, the Company has virtually instructed the Playford Liberal Government to grant further State N , assistance so that the BHP monopoly can tighten its' economic strangle hold. . _
