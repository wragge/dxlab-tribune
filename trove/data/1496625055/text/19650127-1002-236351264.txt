 % — With Tribune's Industrial Roundsman A GED pensioners who went to Canberra at the time of the last Federal Budget got short shrift from Mr. Roberton (then Minister for Social Services) when they asked for a £1 pen sion increase. Ambassador Roberton (to Ireland) will receive a -Minister's, plus a parliamentary Member's, pension of about £43 a week. Add to this an extra £9 a, week for life from the new Ministerial scheme to which he has paid in £55, and on reaching 65 he gets another £3. As an Ambassador he will also get £3,730 salary and £3,560 allow ance a year. No wonder aged pensioners are angry — as one said: "A retired worker today is like an empty beer bottle — sucked dry I" ? A COUPLE of months ago we re- ported that for "economic rea sons" the wealthy U.S. controlled oil company at Kurnell in Sydney (AOR) had ceased watering their lawns. We can now report that the water is again flowing. Business must be looking upl ? A LARGE number of members of the Citizen Military Forces ap parently did not think it was ne cessary to go into the jungles of Vietnam and Malaya to defend Australia. Amendments last November to the Defence Act now make overseas service obligatory, for members of the CMF in the event of a "defence emergency". CMF members were giv en 30 days to consider their position. December resignations of the CMF were 400 more than usual, equal to a rise of 50 per cent. The young 20-year-old conscripts will not be given the same choice. ? A COUPLE of days prior to Xmas the festive spirit dried up at A. E. Goodwins in Sydney . . . the company sacked an Amalgamated En- | gineering Union delegate. Being so close to Xmas, the com pany thought the men would cop it or do in three days' public holiday pay. About 100 AEU members went on strike. This was a clear case of provoca tion which resulted in these workers being robbed of three days pay. A deputation led by the N.S.W. Labor Council was later successful in having the delegate reinstated.
