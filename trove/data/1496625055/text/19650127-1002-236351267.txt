The cost of living in De cember was 4 per cent higher i than -a year ago, equal to 12/- : per week. The ultimate effect of the BHP's .price grab will be to force the cost of living up by an additional 6/- to 9/- a week. ' The BHP cannot, claim that in creased wages costs are responsible ; for the increase in steel prices. 1 The N.S.W. Industrial Commission 'in August 1964 rejected the Iron workers' Union claims for margins increases ranging from 10/- to 134/6 ; per week and awarded paltry in- ! creases ranging from 6/- to 17/6. Some six months earlier the BHP : had raised the price of steel by £3 a ton, lifting declared profits from £16 ; million in 1963 to&lt; £18 million in 1964. From 1955 to. 1964 BHP's steel in- ! got' production increased from a little : over two million tons to just on four and three quarter million tons. . Over the same period declared pro- | fits increased from £4.3 million to £18.3 million. BHP's total declared profits for he ' past ten years amount to more than £33. million. ' Over the same period' the BHP has- ! ploughed back £183 million of undis tributed profits to> expand production.
