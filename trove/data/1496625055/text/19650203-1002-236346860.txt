 Farmers resist commission increase CYDNEY: NSW fruit and veg etable growers — mostly small farmers — are resisting Sydney market agents' at- tempts to increase their com mission from 1\ to 1 0 per cent. This year vegetable growers have had their worst year for the last 10 years. In the last twelve months 80 out of 100 tomato growers in the Liverpool district alone, have been forced out of the industry. The agents have threatened that if they don't get their increase they will cut out certain services that have been provided to the growers for the last 50 years. These services include collecting rail freights and cartage charges on produce, and sending telegrams and making trunklinc telephone , calls at growers' requests. Mr. Justice Taylor recommended an increase to agents during a Govern mental enquiry in I960, but following growers' protests the Minister for Agriculture, Mr. A. G. Enticknap, re fused the increase. Mr. G. Splayford," chairman of the Sydney District of the Communist Party, said this week that the Party demanded an end to small returns to the grower, and high prices to the consumer. A major reason for this was the con trol of the markets by a handful of agents. The solution lay in the elimination altogether of parisitical agents, and the setting up of fruit and vegetable mar keting boards acting under State Government legislation. The main aim of such a board would be to stabilise prices for both grower and consumer, -he said.
