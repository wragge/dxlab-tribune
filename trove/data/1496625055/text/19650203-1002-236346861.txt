 [?] 1 AST Sunday saw the final episode of The Great War. During the past sjx months the 26 episodes of this stupendous series brought to us the horror and futil ity of the .tour-year holocaust that desecrated and destroyed millions of lives and brought anguish and misery to the whole world. One most important point was made quite clear: the men in the line did not know what they were fighting about." The BBC and the producers of the film should be congratulated for their honesty in tackling such a subject. During the run of the series one of the commercial channels showed All -Quiet on the West Front. It is remarkable how this film, taken from the book by Erich Maria Re marque and directed by Lewis Mile stone, gave us scene after scene that -captured the truth, both visu ally and by comment, as seen : The Great War. Both films should be required viewing viewing for audiences for many years to come. The second episode of Homicide (Channel 7, 8 p.m., Saturdays) showed little improvement on the opening story. This Australian series is still too leisurely and unreal. The writing and direc tion were again the chief weak nesses. .This sort of crime drama needs terse and realistic dialogue geared to fast-moving action and conflict. # # JDOBBY LIMB'S program Sound of Music commences a new sea son this Friday, from Channel 9. at 7.30 p.m. This pleasant hour of music and entertainment is an Aus. tralian program that deserves its high rating. It is followed at 8.30 p.m. by East Side, West Side, one of the better American series. QHAKESPEARE'S great Tragedy Othello is showing on Chan nel 2 at 8 p.m. tonight (Wednes day). This Melbourne production should be of interest, especially as a stage production will be seen later this year at the Old Tote theatre in Sydney. Eileen Allison.
