 Tropical fish better than TV TJAVING had TV for several years now we are finding that we are net. getting what wc hoped from it. More and more the radio, record- player and a look at the tropical fish provide the evening's relaxa tion. A cursory glance at the night's TV programs usually produces "Nothing looks very interesting" and no move towards the TV set. No doubt we sometimes miss worthwhile features, because the ob scure and long winded titles often give little clue to the content. Personally I like' to have some idea of the story in the particular program before setting aside the time to watch it. ' Not knowing how far ahead ad vance information is available 3 feel that a pointed to "These could be worth watching" would oe oi value in the column in Tribune. Also what of TV in other countries, both socialist and capitalist? Spread of hours, time allocated to various interests, attention to child viewers, advertising, controls and standards — maybe a couple of pars per coun try per week would be of general interest. The standaid of some commercials is so poor and their shrieking repe tition so irritating that when sl op ping we have heard people refusing some well-known brands because of this. We hope this will become con- tageous. One monthly "super show" does appeal to the viewer as a reason ably intelligent adult, and the pro duct sponsored is spoken of in ac cord with the generally excellent program being presented. This shows that advertising can be handled in a more appropriate way, in fact any divergence from the norm of outshouting each other and standing over the prospective customer is a refreshing change and should be encouraged. m, ptttt tv/trj vnvi ic o J.
