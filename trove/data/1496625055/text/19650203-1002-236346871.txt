 i'nii !A recrlor writes . . j 1 1HE current rise in the j I cost of living has almost j j added the proverbial "last \ | straw" to the already j j overpowers r-g burden of ! | existing, on the present \ : scale of payments made to I j r;ial service pensioners in | I particular, and pensioners j | in general. j j Pensioners are now faced j | with the bleak prospect of I ! stretching their meagre income | 8 even further, in an economy j j which continues to spiral up. I | wards. | | The 5/- increase granted to j | pensioners at the last Budget j | estimates (most of which had | i been devoured by previous rises j 8 in the cost of living) has done j | little to alleviate their predica- j j ment. - I f Apparently, the plight of fam- j j ilies where only1 the husband | | receives the social service pen- \ | sion with an allowance for his j I wife and children, has to be | 8 experienced before one becomes j I conscious that poverty exists j j among many pensioners. j | When granting the 5/- hi- I ! crease in the last budget esti- j 8 mates, there were no provisions s | made for any increase in the I j allowances to be paid in respect j J of a wholly dependant wife or j j children. g The result is that there are I ! many families such as an iÂ«- 8 valid pensioner with a wholly g dependant wife and three chil- g dren, who are in receipt of less | money on which to live, than j are a married couple bosh of whom receive the age pensn S Surely the time is long over j due for a thorough overhaul of | pensions' legislation by lie | Government, and for a more 8 humane and enlightened aP- | praisad of the need of the | fortunate citizens in. this com- s munity. ! j !
