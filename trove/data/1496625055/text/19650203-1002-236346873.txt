 [?] I How many children must die 1 before Council acts? j The "CataHsia" swimming pool in Katoomba has claimed yet I ORother victim, this time a young girl of only eight years. ; qHE is the fourth victim In recent times in Katoomba pools. How many more must die before lour Blue Mountains City Coun- cil and our citizens accept the res- Iponsibility of immediate necessary 4 action to make our pools safe, or I have them closed until they can | be made safe? Such a request went, to the BMC Council's last meeting signed by "$ three local doctors and with the support of the Katoomba High 1 School Parents and Citizens' Asso-, ciation. ' How this 8-year-old girl came to 'the on the tower and dive into the . water is not known. The condition of the water is such that no one can tell whe- /Jiher the depth is three or thirty igjieet. The greatest public commenda- 'fftion must be given to Detective m Tnhn -Rnnrke who at great l'isk Hand fully aware of the dangers, per- - sisted in his efforts to find the child even though hope of rescue ilhad passed and he had reached ex- $jliaustion in his efforts. a Had the water been clear he could have had the child to the surface in his first dive. t| This latest tragedy raises again Jthe question of a responsible per- fson being on duty at the pools the swimming season including Iweek-ends and holidays. | In the four cases of drowning | the victim had disappeared in dense | cloudy water and much valuable time had been lost in trying to find Ithe body. It is a sad state of affairs that Jj lives are thus endangered. Is our Q Blue Mountain City Council and J the public now stirred into action. If Surely now there will be no more is shelving of responsibility and some if very definite action. â€”A- E. Small; f i
