 j MEN OF MT. ISA 1 ! Merv Lilley, Australian poet and short story writer, participated | I in the struggle of the Mt. Isa miners in 1950. In this poem he I | greets his miner friends in their present battles. | I Men of Mt. Isa! I greet you in struggle! I | Glad greetings in struggle for justice again! I | It's fifteen swift years since we struck for lead bonus ... 2 j Now, men of Mt. Isa, you've done it again. | | The leaders are gone from the fields of Mt. Isa, g I Who met on the flat in that clear burning night; j ! To build a new union that would fight for the miners, I | But we reckoned without the strength of the right. . J I They swung to the right as we sat in the moonlight, I I The left wing was left to board the mail train; ! j And I said there'll be twenty more years without struggle, 1 | Now in fifteen swift years you've done it again. | There's many a man with a name like Pat Mackie, I | Will come to those fields and fight there again; j Strong men, strong causes, strong lead in the bloodstream, j And life is for working and fighting like men. | Why do they fight so well in the Isa? I | Mines without love and land without shade? ' cp | There's an old poem lives in the hearts of those miners, g I Written before the Isa was made. 2 I Merv Lilley. !
