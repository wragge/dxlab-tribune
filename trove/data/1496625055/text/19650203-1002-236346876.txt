 p Posties for i 5 -day week CYDNEY: A conference of eight postal unions recently in Sydney decided to plan for the extension of a five-day week to the maximum number of postal workers. The move is aimed at reducing to the minimum the number of em ployees required to man post, offices on a Saturday morning. Unions taking part in the confer ence represent about 100,000 postal workers. All State branches of postal un ions were called on to convene State' campaign committees to work out a program. These committees will be asked to undertake a survey to determine what post offices in city, suburban and country areas can be closed on Saturday mornings without interfer ing with essential services and in conveniencing the public. Last week's conference claimed that employees who would stiU be ttmtmmmmmmmtmmgtstsmmH required to work on Saturday morn- ings . should be paid penalty rates of ' 50 per cent for non shift work and double pay for shift work. Unions and Associations covering officers and employees in the Com monwealth Public Service are pres. sing the Federal Government for four weeks annual leave. Signatures are being obtained to a petition to Prime Minister Menzies in protest at the delay by the Com- monwealth Public Service Board for not taking steps tp implement this leave. The petition has been sponsored by organisations affiliated with the Australian' Council of Trade Unions High Council of Public Service Or ganisations and the Australian Coun cil of Salaried and Professional As sociations. General secretary of the Amalga mated Postal Workers Union, Mr. G. Slater, said he expects to receive about 40,000 signatures to the petition from members of his union. .
