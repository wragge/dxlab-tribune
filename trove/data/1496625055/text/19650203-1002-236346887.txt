 I ORD STANLEY, Lord John L- Russell and Earl Grey all did very well out of cheap labor in England. And, says Mr. Lockwood: "Lord Glenelg, perhaps the first Colonial Secretary to register ofir.cial objection to the use of Indian labor in Australia, was the son of a wealthy East India Company nabob, enjoying fortune provided by Indian labor in India." The British riders of India fac ilitated supply of Indian labor to plenty of other countries — Fiji, for example — but not to Australia. Sir George Grey, when he was Governor of South Australia, and later, of New Zealand, opposed colored inhnigration. But later, as Governor of Cape Colony in South Africa, he favored it. It is not hard to see emerging from these facts cited by Mrs. Lockwood the conception of Australia as the British Tories wanted it to be an outpost, handy to Asia, of the. white master-race, saturated, at all levels of society, with the master-race ideology, able to provide some of the gendarm erie which would be needed when the lesser breeds round about got too restive. That's not what the Australian pioneers wanted their country to be come. Still less is the idea acceptable to Australians of today. The Australian worker of today is opposed, of course, to unrestricted, uncontrolled immigration into Aus tralia from any outside country. But he can see even more clearly than his forebears that Australia's security lies in friendship with the surrounding Asian people. He is more readily than ever coming to discard the 19th century British Tory view of how he should behave to his fellow workers in Asia and to adopt the truly Australian view. Mr. R. Lockwood, who Ts now on his way overseas to take up a position as Tribune special corres pondent in Moscow.
