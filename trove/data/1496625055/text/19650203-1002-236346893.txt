 Prize story in new "Realist" "THE latest issue of "The Realist" (Summer 1964, No. .17) has many interesting stories, including "The Boy from Coomb s> creek by t. J. Grant. This story won the prize in the Katharine Susannah Priehard Award. It is a gripping story of life in the outback, dealing in a very human , way with the colour ques tion. John Meredith's "Funeral March" and Marjorie Hamer's "Nuisance Value" are both stories with a human interest. For this reviewer . Wilma Hed- ley's article "Steele Rudd. — Brief Outline of x his . Work and Times" was of particular interest, but all who remember any of his works will find much to entertain them. Those who have not read Steele Rudd will be inspired to look for his books. "But What Is Symbolism?" by Norman Talbot is Part 1 of an im portant contribution on the sub ject. It further opens up aspects of this question. For readers of Australian fic tion and other publications Judah Waten's "Australian Literature, : 1963-1964" is of particular import ance. Encouragement is given to writers ; by W. A. Wood in his review of Arthur Staples "Paddo". Mona Brand's "Contribution to the celebration of the 400th anniver sary of Shakespeare's birth is both interesting and thought provoking. Poems by Jock Graham, Nalder Bolton, Roger Milliss and others i have themes of every -day life and help to make this issue of "The Realist" a very good buy at 2/6.
