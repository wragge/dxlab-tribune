 [?] By "Challenger" HAT looks like be coming one of the biggest problems of the forthcoming Mos- cow Torpedo soccer tour is overcoming the language barrier. The problem will be not only with the Russian team but also with the State teams selected to meet them. The coach of the State team, . Stefan Cambal, is like ah en gineer without tools. He has a wealth of soccer knowhow but not enough English to get his message across. Stefan speaks German. The, problem is duplicated by the necessity of not only having to find an interpreter who speaks German and English fluently but knows soccer inside out. A likely solution will most likely be the appointment of Peter Van Ryn as trainer- conditioner-masseur of the Satte team, and, as Peter also speaks' German and English- interpreter. The problem concerning the Moscow Torpedo team is that it is understood that Karl Rod ney, former president of Hakoah, was appointed interpreter and has quit. He's reputed to be one of the few people in Aus tralia with a knowledge of both Russian and soccer. # # # New crash helmets nr«HE function Of headgear is twofold and the past week has provided a couple of good examples of this. From the snow-covered ski- fieids of St. Moritz, comes the latest in protective headgear for bobsleighing. Two Swiss bobsleigh champions, Bosshard and Grossenbacher, learning the hard facts of their game from their accidental experiences of crashing the hard-packed snow with their craniums, have de veloped a cresh hat that gives them the appearance, cf up-to- date spacemen, and affords them maximum head safety. According to the daily press last week, sbops at Mt. Isa had sold out of another kind . of , headwear — baseball caps. The town's workers are reputed to look upon the headwear of their leader Fat Mackie as the symbol of unity and strength. On the recent TV program, Meet the Press, we recall that the Press acted very cynically towards Pat Mackie foi\wearing his red New Yorkers' baseball cap. This is very inconsistent on the part of the Press, as any thing Yankee anywhere else (e.g., in South Vietnam), is given their full support. But in this case, this Yankee symbol is serving to help the struggle of the working class instead of suppress them. # # St. George's tenth win? (Contributed by R. McK.) QYDNEY Rugby League fans are speculating on the com ing season's prospects. Such supporters who live out side the St. George district will want. to disagree with me when ' I forecast St. George to win their tenth successive premier ship in 1965. At this stage they have re- — = ; | tamed all of last year's first j !|I and reserve grade premiership j 111 teams despite some rumours that » jiff Brian Graham and Peter Arm- I jfn strong will seek transfers to | p® other clubs. These two have ! 'fjl given great service to St. George j |S but can easily be replaced from j &lt;||| their reserves if needed. ! y|f An interesting assessment of I ifif St. George's strength is that a j $1 player of Brian Graham's skill j .Ijn is relegated to reserve grade if ! |f|g he remains with St. George, | where he had scored 656 points, j ||8 the most by 'any St. George j 9 player in its history. I St. George's main assets to j 'tjjSj become 1965 premiers are their j ill wealth of internationals past ! M and present. j 111 In Langlands, Gasnier, Rapor j- jl and . Walsh, they have the best | |jl in the- world in their positions. S J Add such names as King, | ill Lumsden, Smith, Rasmussen, j l| Provan, Huddert, Kevin Ryan | ja and Monty Porter, with lesser I If lights as Pollard, George Evans, j jp Yeomans, Simmons, McRitchie j 'M as replacements. S 11 The combination St. George j || built up by retaining their j 'M first grade players and playing j il them in their correct position I |f| year after year is -unknown in | ji| other clubs: j j|H| Add to this their, fine club j j|l spirit, and you have a premier- j ® ship team. . j ifm We can only use last year's j f|| form and nominate Balmain as j til their most sirious ival Farra- j 'fm matta, Souths and Norths | ill should fight out the two re- j ;i|| maining semi-final berths. j 11 If, as rumored, Graham and j j||| Armstrong transferred to New- I llf town, then they would be a j || s distinct semi-final chance. j f|| On the other hand, if Graham j ||j goes to Manly, with their for- | || wards strengthened by Queens, j ||| landers Day and Vievers and the return of their regular I | hooker, Fred Jones, they also j|S could out more favoured clubs, j j|l On the question of represen- = ||| tative teams, it is hoped selec- I jj m tors will choose players in their j !|| best positions.
