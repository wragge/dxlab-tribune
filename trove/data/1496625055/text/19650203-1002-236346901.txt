 Anti-U.S. demonstrations flare in Philippines Resentment at US domination of the Philippines militarily, politically, culturally and economically is behind last week's big anti-American demon strations reported, but played down, in the Australian dailies. -THAT is the reason for what US Newsweek magazine called the "new, still limited but potentially serious wave of anti-Americanism" that has "swept across the Philippine archipelago in the past few months". This is serious for the USA be cause, as Soviet New Times says, US policy in South-East Asia re volves round the Washington-Manila axis. It adds: "US influence In the Philip pines revolves around American monopoly control of the economy." "The movement against American neo-colonialism is becoming nation wide." Anti-American feelings reached a new peak on January 25 when 15,000 Filipinos from all walks of life staged a demonstration in Manila. The Chinese official newsagency reports: - "Shortly after sunset, torch-bearing militant workers, peasants, stu dents, youth and other demon strators wearing black . arm bands proceeded down the boulevard to the US Embassy with a huge banner ' reading 'Down with US imperialism!' "They carried 32 black cardboard coffins symbolising innocent Fili pinos killed by US servicemen within and outside US military bases. "They also held high an effigy lab elled 'US imperialism'. Hanging front a chain in the effigy's hands were two figures representing the ordin ary Filipinos." The demonstrators demanded the closure of US military bases and demanded that the Filipino Govern ment cease recruiting mercenaries for service as US cannon-fodder in South Vietnam. Helping to spark the demonstra tion was the refusal to give up US extra-territorial, rights in regard to US soldiers who have committed of fences, as for example by firing on Filipinos accuse1 1 on US bases. The criminr . >e wilful killing ji Sher- man and a boy are still at large.
