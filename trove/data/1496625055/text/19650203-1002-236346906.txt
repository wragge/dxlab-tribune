 Match the special edition with cash! [?] fund target £1,300 By JUNE MILLS | WANT to tell you something of the story behind the spe cial edition of Tribune produced for last Friday to let the people know the truth about Mt. Isa. The Queensland Government intro duced its new regulations on Wednes day. The news was in the daily press and oyer the air on Thursday morning. "Tribune" editorial decided to pro duce the special edition. Work went on through most of Thursday night and by Friday morning the paper was printed and on its way to every State. It was the only paper to tell the full story of the Mt. Isa workers' struggle, backed by, workers in all States, against the vicious State legis lation and police actions. I write about this to stress to readers (who already know the paper always supports the workers in their struggles against foreign and local profiteers) that such a special publication, and its emergency distribution COSTS MONEY — more than an ordinary edition of the same size. The "Tribune" Fund, as I've said before, is to assist bringing improve ments to the paper, including more special issues when necessary. The more you send in, the more improve ments. This week the small amount is disappointing, so let's have an im provement next week! S.T.U.C. 1/-, Dom. 1/-, B. Farrell 5/4, Pat — Seven Hills 15/6, I.
