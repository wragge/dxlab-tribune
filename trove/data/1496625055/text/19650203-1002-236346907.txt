 Aust.-USSR scientific c@-@p®r,si!®n PERTH. — The fcur - day stay in Fremantle of the Soviet scientific ship Vifyaz was very success- ful from a scientific point of view, said a spokesman of the Australian-Soviet Friendship Society. Contact made with Australian scientists was of benefit to both Australians and Russians. There were visits to the University and a geological excursion was made to the Darling escarpment behind Perth. Rocks they dredged from the Indian Ocean are similar to those found in Western Australia. The Russians regarded them as an important clue in their inves tigations into theories of an ancient continent which broke up about 70 million years ago, leaving one piece — Australia. The Soviet guests were given a civic reception by the Mayor of Fremantle, Sir Frederick Samson, who made a return visit to the ship before it sailed. Many friendships with local people were renewed, as this was the third visit of the Vitvaz to Fremantle. In the same week that the Vityaz sailed, the Soviet cargo ship Omsk berthed to load A us- traiian wool.
