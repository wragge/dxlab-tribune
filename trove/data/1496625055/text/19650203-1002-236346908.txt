 U.K. LABOR NEED DRASTIC CHANGES LONDON: The labor movement must win , far-reaching . changes in the Government's policy if a Tory come-back is to be prevented. This is said in a British Com- munist Party statement on the Labor defeat in the Leyton by-elec tion. "Labor's first 100 days in Govern ment has resulted in big abstentions of Labor voters in the first two by- elections", says the statement. "The Government is losing support. What the people expected is not be ing done. "The pensioners' increase was post poned. No definite action was taken to stop rising prices, mortogages and fares. Yet at the same time wage restraint is a major aim of Govern ment policy." The Communist Party calls on all the forces of the Left to move to stop the rot and have the Govern ment adopt a policy to rally and in spire the labor movement to recover lost ground. The statement calls on the Govern ment to pay the pensioners their in crease now; to cut military spending drastically; stop colonial wars and limit the export of capital. The Worker points out that Mr. Reginald (now Lord) Sorensen, who held Leyton with a 7000 majority, had been well-known as a peace sup porter. Mr. Gordon Walker, who lost the sea, was far to the Right; "How could it be expected that active Labor workers would feel in spired to go out onto the doorsteps and ask for support for the war in Malaya, the Atlantic Nuclear Force ( and the Polaris submarine programâ€” or that they would get the workers' support if they did?" the Worker asks.
