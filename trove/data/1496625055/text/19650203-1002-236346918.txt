 Isa women right behind men" i From PETE THOMAS in Mt. Isa j "The strength of the feeling among the women j is astounding, even better than in the 1961 strug gle. The women are right behind the men," ! "T"HAT is how three lead- ing members of the ! Mt. Isa Women's Auxil- | iary last Friday summed up j the solidarity of the worn- | enfolk of Mt. Isa with the j men in, the struggle I against the Mt. Isa Mines monopoly. I They said that, though they had | found women anxious, and though j there had t>eeiw cases of distress I and even destitution, they had not | found hostility among them to-, j wards the men's struggle; the hostility was towards the com- I pany. j As for the Nicklin Government, ! for a moment words failed the I three women. Then one of them j said: "The company and the I Government have been throwing I the ball backwards and forwards j to each other — and we're the | ball." j- But, they said, "the people of j Mt Isa know what they want and I what they are doing to get it." I The three women from the (Auxiliary who were in the Tribune interview were: I _ Mrs. Sally Murray, the Aux- | iliary's president. She came to Mt j Isa four years ago from New Zea- I land. j Mrs. Estelle Deutekom, the sec- ! retary; years in Mt Isa, mother I of a 3i-year-old girl. Mrs. Ann Parker, the treasurer; j came to Mt Isa straight from j ' England nearly_two years ago. \ The women's husbands were Mt | Isa Mines workers, until the com- I pany brutally swung its pre- | Christmas axe. ("The men aren't on strike; the company closed the I gates," the women said. "The men j had tried everything they could to | , get their rights.") The women's organisation started off with ten members to deal with ( cases "of distress. The ten had stayed behind, in response to a call, after a mass meeting in December. Later, it became the Mt. Isa ? Women's Auxiliary, affiliated with the Mt Isa Labor Council, to which it sends two delegates (Mrs. Murray and Mrs. U. Bertolutti). : "Taking part in meetings helps women to know what the menfolk £ are doing, and clears up what could otherwise be misunderstand- " ings," the three Auxiliary women ! said. I Now the "Auxiliary has meetings I of up to 100, "and more arc coming all the time". I The Auxiliary has been able to j alleviate the plight of many. j "The people of Australia are ! being generous with their help, j We appreciate that very much," I the Auxiliary women said. | "The people who have given I the # money can be assured that j it is beinp- ivpII ncprl- w p .ire i I honest and careful, and use it in I | the way that our investigation and j | -our judgment show to be best." j | The women don't see their | | | Auxiliary's role as being limited j J to the present dispute, though they j | are so active around this as the | urgent immediate issue. What they I S aim to do is to carry on the ? | organisation so as to make Mt Isa | &lt; j a better place for people to live in. j | They want lower prices (now j f I they are high, and Vary from place j j I to place; one of the women said | J I she gets bread delivered at 1/11, j | | another said she pays 2/2 at a j ,v | shop; milk is 1/4 a pint in bottles, I .. j 1/6 in cartons). I . They say that if Mt Isa Mines I is to continue to get cheap freight | rates, such concessions should be | extended also to all businessmen, j ; | so that they can reduce prices, j | They want cheaper rents. Now, I ' | they say, a family whose bread- j S winner may be getting £25 a week | may have to pay from ten guineas upwards for an unfurnished (and S sometimes sub-standard) home. 3 "We want Mt Isa to.be a good I town," the women said. | Three women of the Women's Auxiliary mentioned in the story below.
