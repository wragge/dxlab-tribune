 [?] Menzies is destroying a sacred wartime bond ft The Government's dispatch of troops to intervene in the Indonesia ns Malaysia dispute is certain to do great damage to the sincere friendship of m Indonesian people for Australians. yM rURING World War II against fascism, Australian troops a was one of them) were regarded as liberators and friends by the In- i donesians. m This was vividly revealed countless times during and after the amphibi- ?, ous landings in the Halmaheras and nf Borneo towards the end of the war. 5 Australians in particular could do 1 no wrong and so, after the war", un- yl til recently, perhaps of all advanced countries the Australian people have ; been held in highest esteem by the Indonesian people and its Govern- d ment. The part played by the Australian ' working class in the struggle for 4 freedom and independence of tne ri| Indonesian people is a part of the history of the Indonesian people. Mj Many Indonesians I have met have stressed this. They have regarded Australia as a good neighbour, a I Iff friendly one. I 9 During the war, they always called g us (embarrassingly) "good". The I tl assistance and hospitality of the In | h/ donesian people to us were tremend- « ous The comparison between our f f behaviour— a "fair go" attitude and | S one of sympathy and practical as- | fit sistance for the sad plight of the o people — was in sharp contrast to | M the arrogant, inhuman attitude of j both the Dutch and Japanese col- j Slf'oniai masters. . „ . ! 'M As one Indonesian worker replied j ' f : to me: "Who is best, Dutch or Jap? g vi -Well, where the Japs killed two of I I- us the Dutch kill only one." | ||; ' Will Australians be included in | this sadistic standard now? | % Not only the Indonesians, but also I C the people of the North Borneo ter- | $ i ntories will soon come to regard 1 ;vj Australian troops as an alien occupy- | ing force, thanks to the Menzies . | Government. !
