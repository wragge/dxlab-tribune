 Angels' Alley-- "a beaut show" " A N GEL'S ALLEY" at New Theatre Is a beaut show. The girls are a dream of beauty and freshness — their razor gang "protectors" quite lovcably villainous. Marie and John Armstrong have directed and produced the- show with such smoothness that there is never a dull moment. The songs (plenty of them) are bright as shiny buttons and the singing first class. We urge everyone "Give yourself a treat this next Friday, Saturday or Sunday night. Relax, laugh and love the- show as we did". — 5 Kings Crossites
