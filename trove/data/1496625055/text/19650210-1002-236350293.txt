The Government has decided I to erect twin lines of pylons to carry overhead power lines through the Little Para Valley.

LThe people wanted some al ternative, route used. The Committee collected' 3,000 signatures and also sent a letr ter to the Premier requesting I the appointment of a group, in- ? eluding town planners and land- g scape architects, to assess the j role of the Little Para Valley in g the future development of this S area. I The Premier sent a reply I which defended the erection of j the pylons. g The Committee answered by g entering a protest float in the g procession held in connection j with the Salisbury Carnival. j The float comprised a black ! coffin with a wreath of gum g leaves on it. | On the coffin were the words g "Little Para Beauty" and "RIP".

I will continue to see mistakes j such as this." |
