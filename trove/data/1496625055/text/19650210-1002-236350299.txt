I I » I \ CYDNEY: The Milk I j and Ice Carters' I 1 Union of NSW has - 1 I called for an enquiry 1 ! into the so-called sur- 1 ! plus milk" being pur- 2 chased at bargain 4 prices by the_ wealthy 5 j milk companies- \ \ It is claimed that huge i ! profits are being made, by i these companies at the I I expense of the consuming I j public and dairy farmers. 1 | According to reports of the 12 , I | million gallons of milk, sup- 1 plied each month to the Milk I Board's agent companies, about 8 S six million gallons is classified I ! as "surplus" and purchase--' by Si j the companies for as little, as 8 j 1/- a gallon. . J j The N.S.W. Milk Board opera-. |f f tes through agent companies, U j Fresh Food and Ice (now part j I of the U.S. Peters monopoly) 1 | and Dairy Farmers Ltd/ W | Non "surplus, milk" is paid i | for at the Board's price of 4/4.1d PS 9 P a gallon. If | On January 21, a Western Dis- P ' trict dairy farmer served a writ f| I on the N.S.W. Milk Board 1 S claiming £13,500 in back pay- r'?j | ments for milk supplied to the. -/'j | Board, and paid for at "sur- v I plus milk" prices. | The dairyman is claiming that . \ j the Board has mismanaged the | industry and failed to apply, ill \ and observe the conditions of I the Milk Act. | j In a press statement, the - ?f| | general secretary of the Milk and II | Ice Carters' Union of N.S.W. IS I (Mr. R. Rickard) said the ac- « | tion of this dairyman has the III A complete support of the union. Ill The union is demanding that '|S I the N.S.W. Australian Labor IS I Party call for an immediate m I Royal Commission into the milk industry which is controlled by j the Milk Board, appointed by I the A.L.P. in N.S.W. f Explaining the situation lead- j ing to the dairyman's back pay j claim, the union said: "The j Board places dairymen on ! quotas. If the producer's ) "quota is 80 gallons per day | then to maintain his quota he s is forced to over-produce." ! "The Board, through its agent ! companies receive the milk and | pays the producers the Board's | price of 4/4.1d per gallon; how- j ever, the over-produced milk is | called "surplus" and the agent ( companies of the Board pur- j chase this "surplus" from as g low as 1/- per gallon and use it | for the manufacture of bi-pro- j ducts, such as flavoured milk, 1 thick mix, etc." j . .I Section 26 of the. Milk Act pro- | vides that all milk supplied for I consumption or use becomes the j property of. the Board. | On the other hand, the Board j says that they are only con- g cerned with milk for consump- J tion. j The Board rules that milk for j consumption is milk used as j pure whole milk, mainly by the ! housewife at 1/- per pint for ! which the producer is paid j 4/4. Id per gallon. j Section 27 (3) of the Milk Act j makes it an offence for a pro- j ducer to sell any milk to any ! person, etc., other than the I Board for consumption or use. The union asks: "Does the Board then allow their agent companies to contravene the Milk Act, and are these high profits made by its agents in this so called "surplus" milk market?" "A Royal Commission is re quired ' to investigate how the Act as it . is at present operated by ' the Board is used to streng then the already created mono polies at the expense of the consuming public, the producer, the vendor and members of my union," Mr. Rickard said.
