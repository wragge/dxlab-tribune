 [?] 5A workers develop more direct action ADELAIDE: Direct action on wage claims continues to he a fea ture of the industrial scene in South Australia. VA/ORKERS at Adelaide Ship Construction are demanding Â£2 a week flat increase. They held a meeting and decided to send a deputation to the man agement during consideration of ; their claim. When the management's refusal was reported back they decided to knock off for the rest of the day. Approximately 150 workers were involved, including members of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, Boilermakers' Society and Federated Ironworkers' Association. Workers at the Kelvinator, Fins., bury, tool room held a stopwork meeting in the Trades Hall ..nd decided to give the management two weeks to change its negative attitude to a wage claim. Members of the AEU and the Aus tralasian Society of Engineers were' involved here. At the Woodville Council, AEU members have placed a ban on all work except motor vehicle repairs. Usually the men carry out all kinds of metal trades work and it was on this basis that they consid ered they were entitled to more pay. The Council delayed in giving a reply to the wage claim and placed . a questionnaire in front of the men. The questionnaire bluntly asked them for a history of their education. The men regard this as irrele vant to the claim and a move to split the ranks and have an excuse fur delaying the reply to the claim. The ban was the men's reply. Wharf stops Waterside workers at Port Ade. laide held two stoppages recently. The actions have been about tne following matters: Improved rates and conditions at the bulk grain berth number. The men want 5/- an hour ex tra for those on the ship and 1/6 an hour extra for those on the shore, while grain is being poured. Cease unnecessary transfers of evening, shift to vessels whhh have already worked the extended day to 7 p.m. Tally clerks have also stopped work.
