 1965 Wynne Art Prize Awards and the Australian landscape tradition By H. McC. |T was in. landscape painting that Australian art first cut loose from the forms and con ventions of European topo- graphical painting, which had hampered our earliest paint ers, and appeared in national costume, characteristic ally Australian. In the dawn of our century Aus tralian art in the work of such painters as Streeton and Roberts had already taken on' a distinct character: ah Australian school had been founded. Later in the work of Russel Drys- dale we get below the surface and penetrate to the very heart of the ' Australian scene. Can one say that the exhibition of landscape paintings entered for the Wynne art prize carries on or enriches the traditions of this Aus tralian school? Viewing the show as a whole I do not think we can. In place of the bluff grandeur of Streeton, the soft poetry of Roberts or the searching vision of Drysdale we have a parade of neat, super. — B— — —»— III I 1— ficial statements about quaint coun try villages, twisted trees or chalky skies that often charm, but never inspire. The traditions of the Australian school have been thrown aside be fore we have anything significant . to replace them. The judges in awarding the prize have, as in the case of the Archi bald, been unable to agree. We have two winners— David Strachan and Sam Fullbrook who takes out his second Wynne -'ze. I am inclined here to agree with the judges' choice. Both these paintings have atmosphere and authenticity. David Strachan's work is typical- of the district and has caught well the warm dry atmosphere. Sam Fullbrook also strives for atmos phere but abstracts his forms to a much further degree than Strach an. Fullbrook is a painter with n. working class background who has come up the hard way. He is a member of the Victorian Realist group and deserves our congratula. tions.
