 Farmers criticise j market ! CYDNEY : Citrus and vegetable j growers at a meeting of the j National Farmers' Union in j Sydney last week sharply cri- ticised the delay in shifting the overcrowded Sydney markets from Hay market to Flemington. ! They pointed out that this had been ! an outstanding issue for 20 years, and j when carried out would lead to im- ' provements all round. j They also said that in the new set- j up they would demand that the j triplicate system be introduced. This ! would mean that the agents would | have to give a docket to the grower j and the buyer, indicating the price ! they received for the goods and who i bought it. j In the present system the majority | of agents give no dockets and have ! the growers at their mercy. The grow- I er now has only the word of the j agent of the price received for his ' produce. I The present situation in Haymarket I is one of chaos. j
