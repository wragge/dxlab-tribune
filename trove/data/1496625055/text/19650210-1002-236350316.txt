 Rightwing assassins claim two victims Rightwing assassins have twice in recent weeks struck down Prime Ministers who were considered dangerous to imperialism and world reaction gen- . erally DREMIER All Mansour, of Persia, and Premier Ngen- dandumwe. of Barundi, went the way of Hammarskjold, Lu mumba and US President Ken nedy (soon after he signed the nuclear test ban treaty). Premier Ali Mansour, of Persia, and premier Ngendandumwe of Barundi went the way of Hammarskjold, Lumumba and US president Kennedy (soon after he signed the nuclear test ban treaty). Mansour headed a government which had greatly improved Iran's relations with the USSR. Its legislation -assist-, ing land reform and advancing the status of women aroused the hostility of reaction. When Ngendandumwe fell to an assassin's bullet on January 15 last, western news sources tried to pin the crime on the Left but forecast, curiously, that the result of his re moval would be a pro- West course in 1 Burundi. - This has proved correct Ngendan- dumwe's successor, brouhgt to power by his killers, last Sunday broke rela tions with the Chinese People's Re public. Meanwhile 29 members of the Indian Parliament have asked the Govern ment to investigate again the killing of M. K. Gandhi, the great Indian patriot leader, who was. slain by a Rightwing assassin in 1948. Facts newly-revealed have called into questionthe role played by the present Rightwing leader Morarji Desai, who in 19'48 Was Home Minister in Bombay and responsible for Gandhi's security. A witness states that Desai was warned of the coming attempt on Ghandi. but took no action.
