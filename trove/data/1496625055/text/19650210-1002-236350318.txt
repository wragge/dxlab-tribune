 i | | United front pact in France j-THE French Socialist and Communist Parties have j agreed to join forces in March ! to contest the municipal elec- I tions in Paris and 39 munici palities of the outlying Seine Department. This is reported by the London Times' Paris correspondent who i adds: | The two parties are to enter joint I lists of candidates, running on a j "Democratic Union" ticket which I is generally seen, however, as a ! variation of the old Popular Front, j Local deals of this type were ex tensively used between the ballots j in the last general election, with the J avowed intention of outvoting Gaul- | list candidates, but this is the first | time the two parties have con- j certed their tactics in advance I The composition of the joint lists I will be weighted to ensure that j existing Socialist or Communist j majorities will not be upset in the "red belt" round Paris, .where 18 ; mayoralties are held by Com- I munists and eight by Socialists.
