Pravda says the new wave of re pressions threaten not only Communists but all freedom loving Americans. His tory shows that reaction has always started with baiting of Communists and ended with the persecution of all pro gressive minded people. Emphasising solidarity. Pravda says millions of Soviet people angrly con demn this persecution. Millions, both in the United States and throughout the world demand that the persecution be stopped. In an article published by other papers. Art Shields New York "Worker" correspondent savs that Mc- Carran law is fascist in nature and every public organisation in America is under threat of judicial victimisation. Its purpose it to silence the advocates of friendship among nations and op ponents of military aggression in Viet nam and the Cogo. That s why the Commuists. when they come before the court, will be fighting to save the lives of millions. Their victory would do much to stimulate the entire Deace movement. Shields describes the new attack as a cringing capitulation to the extreme right wing, as on act of Goldwaterism that is contrary to the mandate given at the elections. Political commentators note that the attack is undertaken despite the im portant role the Communist Party played in defeating Gokhvater. t
