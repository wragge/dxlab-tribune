Willie, who engaged I an agent to pick his mounts 1 for him, decided to rely on his 2 own judgment while his agent 1 was on vacation. j ' The result was disastrous, for I Willie couldn't ride a winner S for the whole time that his ) agent was away, i One of Australia"s all time j greats, Darby Munro, recognis- 1 ed the fundamental necessity of j a good mount. Explaining his 2 ignominious defeat in a small ! field during the visit to the United States, he said of his i mount, "I felt like getting off. I and carrying the thing; I would | have had a better chance." 1 Sporting j goodwill fHE development of interna - j tional goodwill looks like 2 getting a good boost from sport ! in the near future. . | First of all, we have the USSR"s Torpedo soccer team arriving here this month (or 1 what looks like being a very &lt;11 beneficial tour for the soccer ll world though a somewhat ;M strenuous one for" the visitors 11 The tour is certain to capture 'S the interest of not only soccer -111 fans but also the general public H So far, fi ids of -nor' jn # which Australians will be trav- -'fe elling to other countries include 11 water polo, Rugby Union, cric- If ket, tennis and table tennis. ag In what is certainly a very |l friendly gesture, night European II . countries, Italy; Belgium, Hun- m gary, USSR, 'Germany, Holland 11 United Arab .
