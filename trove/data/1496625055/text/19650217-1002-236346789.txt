 More f hanks for special issue By June Mills TH IS week's special mention goes to the donation of £5 from a Communist Party mem ber and his wife "in appre- ciation of the fine special issue on Mt. Isa". Many other expressions of appre ciation of this issue have reached Tribune and donations have been made. Keep them coming, they , will all help. Tribune Fund target of £1500 for the first six months of 1965 is really a modest one. To reach it, however, we need to raise a litttle more than £56 each week, for the next 20 weeks. This means we must ask all friends to make a greater effort, not only readers in Sydney but all over Aus tralia. It is good, therefore, to note in this week's contributions donations from friends in . New Guinea, Dar win, Cairns, South Australia, Casino and, nearer home, at Woy Woy. Our good friend Butch Wharton has many fine experiences selling Tri bune in Newcastle and seldom fails to collect donations from his cus tomers. This week he has sent 10/- donations from "Street selling".
