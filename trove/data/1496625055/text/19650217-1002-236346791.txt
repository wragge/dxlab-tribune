 | Demand I proper | wrapping j paper j CYDNEY: Shoppers should demand that all 1 groceries be wrapped in ( proper wrapping paper, I Mrs. Zara Splayford, NSW ! Assistant Secretary of the j Union of Australian Wo- | men, said this week. j - She confirmed to Tribune state- | ments published in last Sunday's ! Sun-Herald that members of her | organisation had complained of | some Sydney supermarkets offering j only newspaper for wrapping j groceries. | The UAW is taking this up with j the NSW health department. | Mrs Playford said: "Wrapping | paper is obviously included as part I of the costs and, if firms save on it, it only adds to their profits." | A spokesman for the NSIV | Health Department has said that j by regulation all fish, meats, bread | and foodstuffs eaten in the same ! State where they were sold must be completely enclosed in clean I unprinted paper. S "Members of the UAW have also reported that some chain stores I have a deliberate policy of asking I the customers whether they want | their articles wrapped or not. j "This is another saving for the I chain stores," she said. | Shopping bags | Another organisation putting up j a fight here on behalf of shoppers | is the Women's Committee of tire | Building Women's Industrial ! Union. | At their last meeting they dis- J cussed the position where supcr- ! markets demanded that all shop- j j ping bags be left outside the store, I yet they provided no cloak room J I facilities. j | Because of this many shopping j | bags are stolen, without any com- i I pensation. j | Mrs A. Clancy, the Secretary of = | the Committee said, "that their j S organisation felt that all super- | j markets should provide facilities = j to cloak shopping bags with com- j ! plcte safety". j
