 [?] Throw out those old uniforms |HE furore in Sydney Hospital because nur ses pad their caps to make them look more attractive brings to mind women's uniforms in general. That worn by bus conduc tresses, for example, is far from popular among wearers. Serge is too hot for our summers, and absurdly, once measurements are taken they remain the same even though the girl's figure may alter. Now Ansett-ANA have de creed their air-hostesses must shorten their hair to an inch above the collar. No wonder the girls revolt.

No one knows the date of the atomic tests, and Tahiti, that lovely legendary island will be in the path of the blasts. — Mary
