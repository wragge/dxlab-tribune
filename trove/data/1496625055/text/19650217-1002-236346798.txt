A I®1®® I ABCs political discrimination ADELAIDE : During the South Australian State election campaign the Australian Broad- casting Commission will again discriminate in its election broadcast ing policy. IT will allow TV and radio time to the two anti- Labor parties — the LCL and the D' P — totalling three hours and 35 minutes. The ALP will be allowed three hours. Other parties, including the Com munist Party, will be barred from having time. Thus the policy is slanted against the Labor Movement and in favour of the Playford Government, already operating under an electoral gerry mander. The time allowed the DLP can be considered as time gained by the Playford Government as the DLP will support the Liberals with their preferences. The ABC has declared . that to get time on its network, a Party must received more than five per cent of the total vote in the last elec tions. It is silent on the question of the disadvantage experienced by the parties which do not come under this category. Such parties surely should be given a chance to put their policies forward in order to. get representa tion in Parliament or to win a greater percentage of electoral support. As regards the Communist Party, such discrimination as that exercised by the ABC is nothing new. The people of S.A. need to pro test vigorously against this attack upon democracy. The Social Credit Party had been considering taking action in the High Court alleging unfair advantage and undue influence by the ABC, but has dropped the case in view of high costs involved.
