 W4 elections on February 20: A small swing could topple the WA Govt PERTH: A minor swing in the West Australian elections next Saturday (February 20) could bring about the defeat of the Brand Liberal Government. As the situation now stands, with the Libera! - Country Party coalition holding 26 seats to Labor's 24, a gain of one seat to Labor would dead lock the House. The Government, is in danger of losing the elections, mainly because of its policy of low wages (in fact, a virtual wage freeze) on the one hand and huge handouts to monopoly on the other. There is a great deal of hostility aimed at the Government and state Industrial Commission. At the recent basic wage hearing the unions' claim for a rise of £3.1.0 was rejected, and the Commission awarded them 3s.l0d per week (this included a 2s.8d quart erly increase)— exactly what the Gov ernment and employers demanded! Mr. Gordon Murray, Communist candidate for. Swan in Legislative Assembly said that the prosperity of the Midland Railway Workshop vitally affected the people in his electorate. At present there was wide dis content from workers at the work shop at the Government's low wage policy. More than 60 have resigned since Christmas. ' Mrs. Annette Aarons, Communist candidate in the Metropolitan pro vince of the Legislative Council said that there should be price control on all essentia requirements, in cluding land. "This will hurt the market manipul ator and land speculator but make it easier for working . families", she said. She nad attentive audiences at. many factories, Ship Painters and Dockers' Pick-up, Co-operative Bulk Handling Wheat Silo and P.W.D. yards. Financial support for the two Com munist candidates has been particul arly good. Mr. Gordon Murray Mrs. Annette Aarcns
