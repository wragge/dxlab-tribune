 j Unions position clear ! A large number of trade unions j have placed on record their com- | plete opposition to the NCC and S the DLP for their anti -working I class policies | Many have learnt from practical | experience the disruptive activities ! of the NCC in the affairs of the unions and on numerous occasions | these people have been responsible ! for imposing court ballots on d unions. The Amalgamated Engineering Union is one such union which suf fered from a long period of NCC disruption. This is the reason why a rank and file delegates' conference re presenting about 19,000 AEU mem bers of the Sydney District last September declared the NCC a bogus organisation and called for its isolation from working class organisations.
