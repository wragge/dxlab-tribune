The London Times' Washington Correspondent said on February 9: "It has been established that the retaliatory act was planned two months ago" (that is, two months earlier than the "Viet cong" raids on U.S. forces in South Vietnam).

Obviously they had been sent to the area in advance. ,,Th® Lndon Daily Mail says that rne u.s.
