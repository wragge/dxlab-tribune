 Aborigine rights i clash in Walgett Local Correspondent WALGETT (NSW): Syd ney University students pick eted the R.S.L. Club here for seven hours on Monday, from noon to 7 pm, because Aboriginal Diggers are not allowed into the club except on Anzac Day. Student members of the Students' Action for Aborigines Council walked up the main street of Wal gett with banners which read: "Is Walgett Australia's disgrace?" "Good enough for Tobruk; why not Walgett?" and "Bullets do not dis- crimate". The students are members of a special contingent touring by bus through N.S.W. country towns where discrimination had been reported against Aborigines. In addition to attracting publicity, they are making a social survey of Aboriginal living conditions. A crowd of 350 local citizens in cluding many Aborigines gathered outside the Club. In the beginning, the white people in the crowd were laughing, but they then joined in a long mass discussion on discrimination, with many Aborigines also taking part. Many people in the crowd seemed concerned that Walgett might become known as a racist town. During the day the students also picketed a local frock shop whose owner refused to sell a dress to an Aborigine. A line of cars including many friendly supporters escorted the students' bus out of town, when it left for Moree at night. On the road, a deliberate attempt was made by some Walgett citizens in a truck to overturn and wreck the bus. Details were given when the stu dents returned here at midnight to report to the police. The NSW Labor Council has been asked by the Building Workers' exe cutive to seek a Government inquiry into the Walgett attack. The Eureka Youth League (NSW Branch) in a press statement yester day called for the strongest support for the students, and Government action to prevent racial discrimina tion anywhere and to ensure that Aborigines who supported the stud ents' action are protected from rac ial victimisation.
