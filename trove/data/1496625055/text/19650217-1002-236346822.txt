 Men storm city hotel SYDNEY: About 40 angry builders laborers stormed the Prince of Wales hotel in Sydney (City) yesterday (Tuesday) in protest against the re- fusal of the licensee to serve beer to two Aboriginals. Mr. Ken Currie, a young married man with two children, and Mr. Doug Meredith had been refused service in the hotel lounge. They had recently arrived in Syd ney from Brisbane and had ob tained jobs. Mr. Currie is a rigger and a member of the Builders' Lab orers Federation. Members of the union heard of this discrimination following their stop- work meeting yesterday and decided to send a deputation of protest to the publican. The licensee claimed that Ser geant Maloney of the Licensing Squad had told him to ban all Aborigines. ' He was told that the Federation viewed all forms of discrimination against colored Australians with serious concern and that the execu. tive of the union would take the matter up with the police and de cide on other forms of appropriate action.
