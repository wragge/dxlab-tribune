 BALLAD OF THE CONSCRIPT I met a man in Saigon. He said, "I'll see you soon, But I'll be dead and you'll be dead By the rising of the moon " The paddy fields were running blood. The rice was wet and red, I met that man in Saigon With a bullet through his head There's dead men in Saigon To roll the profits in For the bonny men of rubber And the bonny men of tin And blonde head and black head And brown eyes and blue, We'll all be dead in Saigon Before the morning dew. 1 could not move, 1 could not speak I could not go so soon. I shot a man from Hanoi by The rising of the moon. A man in Kuala Lumpur, He took me by the hand, He said, "Why do you trample Blood across my land?' He said, "Why do you march past With such a scornful eye? We are brother conscripts. They send us out to die We are the bloody brothers. We stick the bayonet in, For the bonny men of rubber. And the bonny men of tin. And black head and blonde head Brown eyes and blue, The dead in Kuala Lumptu Will gather like the dew." How could 1 move, how could 1 speak, How could I. go so soon, But 1 fled from Kuala Lumpur, At the rising of the moon A mar. came our oi Africa, I-Iis face was like the sun He barred my way, he put his hand Upr my loaded gun. He said, "You must go back again," But I knocked his hand away, My- hand was in my pocket Feeling for my pay. I fell across the Congo, At the ending of the day. I could not move, I could not speak. My head was shot away. 1 fought lor. copper cobalt, I fought tor zinc and tin, But I never got much profit When I stuck the bayonet in. Before the rising of the moon, We all were dead and gone, "he man from Kuala Lumpur, ;v>e man from Saigon. j.c. there was another headless man Who stopped . . and hurried on â€”Dorothy Hewett (Jan. 1965)
