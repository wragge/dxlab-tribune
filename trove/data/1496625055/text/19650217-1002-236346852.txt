 ProfsÂ® for Gowf blew at Ansett QJ1DJSEY: The High Court decision to uphold the validity of New South Wales laws on airline regis tration has been a widely approved setback to Australia's hieeest private transport monopolist, R M Ansett. There is wide opinion in Sydney Labor Party and trade union circles that this result is one of the NSW Government's most popular and posi tive achievements during its present term. This opinion, which is concerned over mounting attempts to defeat the Government in the forthcoming State election, points out that the Ansett case proves what can be achieved by a firm anti-monopoly stand by the government. Similar stands in the interests of the working people of the State in their struggles against the Broken Hill Pty. and other monopoly expoiters in town and country would ensure poli tical gains for the Government. The High Court decision came at a time when Ansett has been waging an offensive to extend rapidly his air and land transport empire (particular ly Ansett-ANA interstate airline and its various State subsidiaries, and the Pioneer interstate bus and freight net work) ana also his new television holdings. The legal clash arose from a 1961 NSW Government decision to realloc ate some of the Ansett-operated coun try air services in NSW to the in dependent East-West Airlines. After Ansett failed in a legal challenge, his friends" in the Menzies Government arranged application of a Federal law to stop East-West from operating on the Dubbo route. '
