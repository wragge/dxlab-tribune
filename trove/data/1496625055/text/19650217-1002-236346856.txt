 [?] I By "Challenger" | RON CLARKE, the | world six-mile and | 10,000 metres record I holder, looks like j maintaining his top- 1 grade of perform- J ances. | Last Saturday at Mel- j bourne's Oiyiv.rvc Park, | Clarke defeated Alby ! Thomas, the Australian 1 mile record-holder, by I seven yards in the mile I race. | Thomas predicted that Clarke I was set for a series of vic- tories on his overseas tour | this year. I Much weight is given to this | prediction by Alby Thomas I' in a comment by Herb Elliot I recently on ABC radio. | Herb .pointed out that Ron j Clarke has a base mark near | world record times. I By this he meant, that. | Clarke has been able to per- | sistently run world times with- I out the stimulus of having | top class opposition to really k. I. push him on to still greater effort. £ Comeback on Rugby League | T>. MeK. (Tribune, Reb. 3) | say that 1965 will be St $ George's 10th Rugby League I premiership win. jp This is "counting your chick- 1 ens before they are hatched." 1 No doubt St. George has a I great team and, may I add, al good bunch of sports. ' 1 If we look carefully at last I season's play, "a number off teams narrowed the gap be- if tween themselves and St. I George. ' | On a number of occasions 1 when Saints were the victors there was very little if any be- 1 tween them; Big hopes oi Parramatta x downing Saints for the premier- £ ship faded when the 'Matta fell % to pieces, half way through the competition, caused by what f appeared to be dissension in the : : team. I believe we are going to see 1 a better Parramatta this year. Brown from Queensland, from what we saw of him last sea- % son, is going to be a real thrill 1 to fans. 'I If he can find the team | n spirit alongside the boy from | the mining town of Lithgow, | , Barry Rushworth, then these | two are going to really turn it | j on. p j Team spirit and the will to M -: win must be the 'Mattas mainjp j concern. 1 j Souths came to life in 1964 | j Speed and the will to \vin I was their main asset. 1 I A little more weight and bet- 1 ter tactics, could bring Souths! j right back into the picture. 1 | If they don't win the premier- 1 S ship they will be knocking at| I the door, and no doubt will up-J j set a number of teams who ap- 1 | pear to have claims. | j Norths narrowed the gap a lot I I last year, and should have done.| j better. | Why a great try-getter like | ! Irvine has got to beg to get | the ball is beyond everybody's | j understanding. | j Manly played good football, | J and will be a force to contend | with. I I Newtown started off well last I season but could not hold the I form. | j These chaps are popular witn g j fans; no matter how they arel I ' being defeated they box on, f| j never throwing the game away. I Better luck this season top | Newtown! f| f Balmain, a great defensive | team counting on Barnes' boot. j| to do the scoring, were runners S up last season; they did a fine || j job and made Saints play every |j I inch of the way to win and must || j be a greater danger this season || I Wests were beset with bad,| | luck last season through in- 1 juries. % | Always a good . team in "the g | past, let us hope for a better | spin for them in 1965. j Canterbury and Easts were at j the bottom of the listjwho knows | they may not be there at the . j end of 1965. .% | Let us hope for a change ov. ! fortune for the drummers, j I will be there barracking frj| | Souths. f; I May the best team win! $ l 1 1 imwiim„, Prir-d and published by j| Y 168 Day Street, Sydney n .... >.jss Street.
