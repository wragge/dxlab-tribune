 Butch and the hoys 3 £1,500' By June Mills gUTCH WHARTON, of New castle, has sent us his "best story ever" from his long Tri bune selling experience. Sending 10/- for Tribune Fund this week (3/11 collected and a personal donation of 6/1) Butch told of an ex perience recently with four 16 and 17- year-olds, when he was. selling the paper in Newcastle. "We hate commos, why don't you nick off home", they said to him. The oldest boy was cheeky and arrogant. Next week they came back again, the oldest boy saying to Butch, "we'd like to go and fight the commos; it's the commos on the wharves and Mt. Isa who are causing all the trouble." Butch listened to them, but did not argue. He went on busily selling , the paper and speaking to each of his customers. The boys stood and listen ed to what was said and after some time one of the lads said "I'm going to buy a paper". Each of the boys followed suit and finally the oldest boy also bought a paper. Butch took the opportunity to tell the lads how, as an old Digger, he was trying to save them and other boys from conscription, because he'd seen so many young men killed dur ing the first world ' war. The four lads look like becoming regular Tribune readers and we'll leave it to Butch to get them inter ested enough to donate to the fund!
