 Basis to defeat PI ay ford, March 6 ADELAIDE: The main points upon which the Labor Party will contest the State elections have been made public and will be welcomed as a sound basis for the defeat of the Playford Government on March 6. MB: F. WALSH, ALP parliamentary i leader, has repeated the Party's pledge for electoral reform, based on a larger House of Assembly and one vote one value. If the Labor Party is successful in forming a Government, this undertak ing could lead to breaking the un democratic stranglehold 1 that the Lib eral and Country League has had for many years. In the light of Playford's refusal to grant equal pay, the undertaking given by Mr. Walsh, could win con siderable electoral support from work ing and professional women. As the Workers' Compensation Act in SA is the worst of any State, the Labor Party's prQposal to amend this and to include in coverage to and from work will also meet a ready response. Other progressive policy points in- ' dude the acceptance of the principle of., service, grants to Government em ployees, four weeks annual leave and improved long service leave for work ers under State awards. Canvassers The Communist Party has nothing to do with deceptive canvassing methods and removing electoral material from letter boxes. This was stated by the CPA Presi dent in South Australia (Dr. A. H. Finger.) The Minister for Education (Mr. Baden Pattinson) has alleged that "Communist" canvassers in the Glen- elg electorate, have given false state ments about LCL policy and have also removed LCL literature from letter boxes. Dr. Finger said: "As a responsible party of the Australian working peo ple we condemn such practices as Sir Baden describes. "Thinking people jvill not' be very impressed by the Minister's suggestion that such tactics are 'Communistic' made without any evidence whatso ever."
