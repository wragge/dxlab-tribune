 Union wants Calwell fro . « » Call to abolish overseas service SYDNEY: The Building Workers' Industrial Union has asked the Leader of the Opposition, Mr. A. Calwell, to publicly indict the Government for its National Service Act . . . described by the union as the "introduction of a state of pimps and in formers." ' T"HE union asks the Labor Opposition to press for the removal of Section 55 of the Act and for the abolition of conscription for overseas ser vice. Section. 55 of the Act provides that an employer should not employ, or retain in his employment for more than seven days, a person required to register who had not done so. Attention Is drawn to a press report that the Minister for Labor and Nat ional Service, Mr. W. McMahon, told employers they "must not employ 20- year olds who have failed to register for national service." "The obvious way in which employ ers can satisfy themselves they are observing the law is to ask 20 year- old employees, or new recruits, to produce their certificates of registra tion," he said. "If an employee does not, the em ployer should satisfy himself a week later that the employee is registered. "And, if after being asked to do so, an employee fails- or refuses to register, the employer should notify the Registrar for National Service. "Where there is reason to doubt the age given by a youth, the em ployer should ask him to produce a birth certificate or other proof of age. "By following this procedure, em ployers would discharge their respon sibilities under the Act," Mr. Mc Mahon said. Mr. F. Purse (Federal Secretary BWIU) said, "McMahon's statement is a clear indication of the degeneracy of the Menzies Government and the steps it has taken along the road to fascism, and the introduction of a state of pimps and informers about which the late J. B. Chifley issued a serious warning." The union will also raise this mat ter with the Australian Council of Trade Unions.
