 Campaign against State aid CYDNEY: The Federation of Parents and Citizens' As sociations of NSW and the NSW Federation of Infants' and Nur- sery School Clubs have launched a State-wide campaign against State aid to private schools. All Associations will ask their mem bers to personally canvass the views of Parliamentary candidates "to seek their support to halt the growing threat to the system of public educa tion." The campaign was announced last week jn a press statement by the Australian Council of State School Or ganisations. The Council represents over 7,000 in dividual parent organisations and H million children in public schools throughout Australia. A booklet, "State Aid for Non-State Schools is Dangerous", has been pro duced by the Council and about 40,000 will be distributed at first in NSW. Mr. S. Lewis, President of the Teachers' Federation of NSW has congratulated the parent organisa tions for launching the campaign. He said the campaign was in con formity with Federation policy and that the Federation would assist to distribute the booklet. The Council said "the provision of financial assistance by both Federal and State Governments to private schools and their pupils constitutes a grave threat to the continued advan cement of the public school system. "Such financial support will tend to weaken the state schools and tend to create or perpetuate stratified divi sions in a culture, whether along eco nomic, social class,- religious or racial lines." "It is agreed without question that parents should be free, if they so wish, to choose the type of school their children will attend; but if such parents choose to use other than facil ities provided by the state schools, it should be at their own cost," Coun cil said.
