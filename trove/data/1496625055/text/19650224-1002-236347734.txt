 Menzies on ; Mt. Isa j 'jpilE Prime Minister, Sir Robert 1 Menzies, statement that the i Federal Government's powers in ! the Mt. Isa dispute were "for all j practical purposes non-existent, | is, to say the least, a condemna- ! tion of the Government's policy ! of providing the taxpayers' money to assist foreign investors and companies to exploit Australia's mineral resources without ade quate legislation to protect the Australian peoples' interests. Sir Robert obviously subscribes to the philosophy of pragmatism where Australia's mineral resources are concerned; his carefully chosen words in relation to the Mt. Isa dispute clearly show where his sym pathy lies. i Whatever the rights and wrongs j of this dispute, the fact remains that the best interests of the Aus- j tralian people have not, and are j not, being served by the Govern- : ment's inexcusable laxity in fail- | ing to provide protective legisla- j tion against the domination of the j mineral resources by foreign mono- ! polies. | Short of nationalisation, the j Prime Minister might consider bringing down legislation to ensure j that our country retains the con- j trolling interest in mineral re- sources. â€” H.
