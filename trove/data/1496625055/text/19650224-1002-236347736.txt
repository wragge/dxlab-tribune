 "" 4 Welcome Four Corners pOUR CORNERS, the popular ABC program, commenced its 1962 season last Saturday at 8 pm. It was introduced by Mr. Duck- manton, the new general manager of the ABC. We. were given a brief account of program policy and a statement to the effect that political pressure had at no time influenced staff changes or program alterations. Further, he gave an assurance that controversial current events would receive due notice and atten tion. It is to be hoped that Mr. Duck- manton's charmingly phrased pro mises will become a reality. # # 'J'HE main Item in this week's program was a brief survey of the Indonesian scene. Interviews with President Sukarno and his deputy, Dr. Subandrio and also with the leader of the Indo nesian Communist Party, Mr. Aidit, left no doubts that they and the , Indonesian people seek a peaceful settlement of the dispute with. Malaysia. Four Corners is still the most informative and adult program of its kind on TV. It will be interesting to see if there were any TV cameras on the spot at Walgett and Moree to film the reception given to the univer sity students who were visiting these places to learn something about the status of our Aboriginal popula tion. # # | AST Thursday night from Channel 2 at 8 pm, The Amazing Chan Canasta is a program which lives up to the adjective in its title. Chan. Canasta is a man who likes to call his show "experiments in - psychology research." After watching two half-hour prog rams it is impossible to tell if the show is an exhibition of mind read ing, thought transference o- plain memory. Whatever it may be, it is a most entertaining half-hour which seems to flash by in ten minutes.
