 UNION CLEANS OUT N.C.C. SYDNEY: Two officials of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, who were supported by the National Civic Council, were defeated in union elections last week. fpHEY are Messrs. V. Clarke (organ- iser 01 tne syaney uiscricc ana tne South Coast of NSW) and J. Mc Dowell ( Commonwealth Councillor covering Queensland, West Australia, Darwin and part of NSW). Mr. H. Gillman (an ALP member) defeated Mr. McDowell, 4780, to 3511; and Mr. C. Doyle (ALP) defeated Mr. Clarke, -4810 to 3685. The defeat of Mr. McDowell com pletely removes the influence of the NCC from the union's Commonwealth Council. Last year Mr. Shearer, also, sponsor ed and supported by the NCC, was defeated for his position oh the Coun cil by Mr. R. Bruggy. Messrs. Shearer and McDowell had earlier controlled the Council by be ing two of the three voting members of that Council. Following his defeat last year, Mr. Shearer immediately took up a Men- zies Government appointment in the Immigration Office in London. A conference representing 19,000 Sydney AEU members last September declared the NCC a bogus organisa tion and called for its isolation from working class organisations. The conference condemned the NCC for the court ballots imposed on the union, for its wages policy, its organ ised disruption of trade union unity and its support for the Democratic Labor Party.
