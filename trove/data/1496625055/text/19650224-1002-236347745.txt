 TORE UP | TRIBUNE i ! BUT. . . i c e I months ago 1 j | was walking hand in... | | hand with my gsrS-friend j ! in the Sydney Domain. I | We casually walked past1 ? | the Communist' soap-box 1 | and decided to stop and I i listen for a v/hiSe. $ ? .1 | J At that Time I was fanatic-' 9 | | ally anti-communist and at the | | f spur of the moment I bought g | | a copy of your paper, the Tri- | \ | bune, walked up to the speaker, | | i tore the paper to hits and threw g | I it in his face. I could hear the | | a booing' from the audience as I | | I stamped away. j I | However, since then I came g | | across another copy of your | | | Tribune and decided to read it | | I to see how well I could pick g | | it to pieces. S I | I read it, and believe me, the I | | following week I bought four | | J copies of Tribune from a paper g | | shop, one for myself and three S | g for my mates. | | | 1 would like to commend you | I j on presenting the news in such J | j a way as it really produces a j | i real positive policy for the j I ! working force of Australia. I I | j would also like the speaker at I I g the Domain on that particular S | S Sunday to accept my apology g 5 1 0r thing I did in complete f j g ignorance. | 4 g I now realise what makes | | "anti-Communists": the daily ! | press and the rantings of the I i ivienzies Government. â€” TRI. j I BUNE READER. | j |o j S
