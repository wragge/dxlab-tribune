 2. loo people wont cop 'redevelopment' scheme -yHE united and determined efforts by members of the Woolloomooloo Progress Asso ciation and other residents of the Too are drawing much fav- orable publicity to their protest against the proposed redevelop ment scheme for that area. The scheme is proposed by a Brit ish Company to redevelop 67 acres of the 'Loo area at the cost of an estim ated Â£82 million. Over 300 Woolloomooloo residents recently packed a public meeting at. the Royal Blind Institute to discuss what action they could take to protect their interests. Many people, experienced in the way big business bull-dozes the little man out without just compensation, addressed the meeting. Everyone was invited to give a point of view, and there was no shortage of speakers. Mrs. Christy of North Sydney told the meeting of her experiences in getting suitable compensation when her and many others homes were resumed to make way for the War- ingah Express Way. Mrs. Christy maintained that the only real way 'Loo people could pro tect themselves was to show their determination through united action and organised protests. Mr. Sharman, President of the 'Loo Progress Association drew attention to past struggles of local residents, such as the fight to stop the unnecessary demolition of the St. Kilda flats. Mr. E. Boatswain, organiser of the Building Workers Industrial Union said that his union policy towards such schemes was that they should not in any way infringe the interests of the people. Mr. Boatswain said that the BWIU would support the residents fully. The meeting unanimously condemn ed the scheme, and hundreds of signatures were collected for a peti tion of protest to the Premier.
