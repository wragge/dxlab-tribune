 [?] 1. Long fight wins battle for health RESIDENTS in Girra- ween Road and Normac Street, Girraween (near Parramatta, Sydney) have won a long fight to have a drainage system complet ed at the back of their homes. Stormwater began to flow into their backyards a couple of years ago through deep drains left for drainage pipes that had not been laid. Residents telephoned Holroyd Coun cil officials in Merrylands and pro tested. After many protests a Health Inspec tor investigated the drainage but ' nothing was done. After further flooding eight residents signed a letter of protest and sent it to the Council. - Town clerk Mr. Arnott replied: "By the direction of the Council I am to say that an estimate has now been prepared for the construction of, drainage in the area, but it is regret- ted that finance is not available at the present time and the estimate has been added to the drainage schedule. After this, sullage also began, to flow into their backyardsâ€” bringing with it mosquitoes and rats. This plus the indifferent promises of the Holroyd Council officials pro duced a petition from the residents (Maltese and Australians) which was signed by eleven homes. Ten of the householders went to the Holroyd Council meeting to put their , protest in as clear terms as possible. The drainage was then investigated by five representative of the Holroyd Council. They were the Mayor Mr. Bennett, the Health Inspector Mr. Brisley, the Deputy Town Clerk Mr. Rogers, Councillor Sammut and. the Engineer. Soon after this the pipe-laying machines were finishing off the job started some years ago. RIGHT: Plioto shows a trench-dig- ging machine preparing the ground before the pipes are laid. v
