 [?] 1 am writing in connection with a matter which has had me worried for some time. 1 HAVE been in prison on three occasions, the last time being 12 months ago. However, since then I. have not been given a chance. Every position I've had I've lost through the intervention, of the police. Is this giving a fellow a fair go at rehabilitation? Admitedly I have been an alco holic, but I have not touched a drink for 18 months. No church will help me with my problem, of employment or accommodation, and as for So cial Service how can one live on £4.2.6 a week. After the treatment I have received from our very noble police force I am willing to go to any length to get some means of exposing this so- called law. Also, Long Bay gaol is the last place on earth. No proper medical treatment is available, the doctor is governed by the prison authorities, not by the Medical Association, which I think is wrong. Can you help me with this prob lem? "Unhappy Alkie", (Sydney). B .
