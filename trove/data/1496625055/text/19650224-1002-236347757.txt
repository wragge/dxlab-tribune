 Law school discusses Isa dispute PERTH: Abrogation of the legal rights of the individual in connection with the Mt. Isa dispute were referred to by Perth la'wyer L. L» Davies at the 5th annual Summer Law School held at the WA University recently. JUR. J. R. KERR, QC, Presi- " dent of the Law Council of Australia, who presented the main paper, said that the right to legal representation and ad vice was regarded as funda mental where life, liberty, pro perty or reputation were threatened. Western countries regarded rule of law as a distinguishing feature be tween it and Communism, he said. .Mr. Davies said he did not know why Communist countries should be picked on in complaints about the absence of the rule of law. He thought it had yet to be proved that the Communist coun tries in particular denied the or dinary process of justice. Criticism, like charity, should start at home. Recently a man had been forbid den to travel from one part of an Australian state to another part and was forcibly removed from an air craft without any trial or any pro cess of law, simply because he was interfering with the profits of 8 mining company. He did not hear any protests from any legal bodies about that mat ter. The Law School showed that law yers in Australia have come to the conclusion that the State should subsidise a legal aid scheme. Mr. Kerr said the right to legal &lt; representation and advice was re- garded as fundamental where life, s liberty, property or reputation were threatened. The- Law Council of Australia be- v lieved that lack of money should t not prevent anyone with a legal »- claim from putting it before a court through counsel of their own choice. Under the legal aid scheme, a _ committee would investigate _ cases requiring legal aid, and if the claimant had a case, would have counsel allocated. 5 He would pay a proportion of the fee, depending on his means, the , government would pay the rest, and lawyers' contribution would be charging lower fees.
