 Isa "shower" for folksingers pOLKSINGERS Geoff Wills and Margaret Kitamura of Bris bane sang recently to a massed meeting of the Isa miners. Miners are reported to have giv en them a shower of over £100. The singers picked the money up between songs and later gave it to the strike fund. This gesture shows that they are "folkies" who don't mind mix ing lead and dust with their cor- fee— for a good cause. Two Isa songs have come to light in Sydney already. Heard any more?
