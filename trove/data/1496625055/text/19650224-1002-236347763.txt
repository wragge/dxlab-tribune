 " Seduced and Abandoned" [?] -j-HE Italian director Pietro Germi is well-known for his progressive film making. Several of his films -have been shown in Sydney in recent years. These include "The Railwayman", "A Sordid Affair" and "Divorce Italian Style". Germi has always . been concerned with the individual and his relationship to society. "Seduced and Abandoned", now showing at Sydney's Gala Cinema, is another comedy of manners, but cuts deeper into traditional pre judices than "Divorce Italain Style". It is the story of a girl made pregnant by a medical student while he is conducting a courtship of her elder sister. Within this slight ' framework Germi attacks the whole fabric of the Sicilian code that demands satisfaction of the "honor" of the girl's father. He cleverly lampoons and satir es the attitudes of Sicilian life that regard women as chattels in the marriage market. The comedy is uproarious but underneath the film achieves a high degree of social criticism. The final scenes are particularly sav. age and jibe at the cruel. and in human sacrifice of the young girl for the sake of family pride and honor. The acting is exceptionally good. There is a splendid performance from Sarvo Urzi as the indignant father. Alda Stefania as the girl and Aldo Fuglisi as the impudent lover. Edmund Allison.
