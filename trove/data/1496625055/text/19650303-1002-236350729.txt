 iiMriRnTOiia i I — — ! I Bosses want j monev before sex! j By MARY j j DOSSES employ all kinds I of excuses for eco- ! nomising (always at the j expense of the workers) . I But one of the weirdest and I funniest came out last week dur- | ing a Sun-Herald survey sparked | off by letters from qualified sec- | retaries and stenographers in the | over-40 age group who find age I a handicap when applying for a | job. Employment agencies say that S employers "let it' be known" I they have enough trouble at I home with a wife aged 40 with- out having another like her in I the office! | The agency manageress, of | course, agreed with the bosses, ! saying "Some women get ter- j ribly temperamental in their J forties." f How about some men? Many j women office workers will agree j they have worked for bosses, 1 who, emotionally, never got past ) the diaper stage, j However, we all know the real = reason juniors are preferred — i they are paid less wages, and j less wages means more profits, j It's as simple as that. i #- j A well-known U.S. film star ! and her husband were paid two ) hundred thousand dollars for | two days work TV-advertising | the stuff. Reflect on this, you j coffee drinkers. According to j Time magazine, many important | actors are going in for TV sell- I ing in a big way— for big dough of course. | These star "salaries" are crim- | inally absurd when one considers that in the U.S. many young peo- | pie are barred from higher educ- | ation because they cannot afford | it; slums are spreading in cities S and towns, and across the nation I medical facilities are inadequate. 1 # | j>EGARDING medical facilities, | let's come a bit closer home, i By the end of the year, it's ob- I vious we'll be paying more for j health — that most priceless asset g which should be everybody's j birthright. S Some doctors complain they g have too many pensioner patients I at reduced fees and this adverse- | ly affects the lucrativeness of j the practice. S But how are parents going to I give their children proper medic- j al care when, already, on one g wage, they are battling? We need I a real national health scheme. j ' # | AUGHT down-town in the Syd- j ney lunch-hour traffic hold- up last week during the Services' I Churchill March, I watched the I parade of force, jungle green, g stirring martial music. j 'Midst the crowd was a pram g containing a tiny, week's-old I baby. . | The military trucks rolled past g with their double-rows of seated, S steel-helmeted soldiers, complete I with webbing and guns; jets | roared overhead drowning the I noise of the band. I a I saw no glory in the spectacle. I I thought of other babies and j mothers, in Vietnam, in the g Congo, who, at this moment, | know the brutal reality of war, | violence and. military . might. j
