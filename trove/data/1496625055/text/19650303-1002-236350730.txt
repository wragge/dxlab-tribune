 Labourers stop over sackings pERTH: Over 60 builders laborers stopped work las1 Thursday on the Civil and Civit construction job on new Gov ernment offices to protest ove the dismissal of I I of theii workmates. , Earlier in the week a lunch houi meeting had demanded that 10 non unionists join by Friday. However, oi Wednesday the management summar ily dismissed these men with 8 hour! notice, without giving them sufficient time to join the union. Further to this, on Thursday morn ing a leading-hand rigger was dis missed after an argument with I foreman. On Thursday night, after the men had been on strike for the after noon the management agreed to re instate the 10 non-unionists and the leading hand as an ordinary labourer On the basis of this, the men decided to return to work after lunch on Fri day. However, on reporting for work thi management refused to let the vie timised men start. At a meeting or Friday night the men decided that n&lt; work would take place over the week end and that a further stop-won meeting would be held first thing or Tuesday morning. (Monday is a pub lie holiday). Friday night's meeting was inform ed by the Employers' Federation that six of the victimised men would b( re-instated on Tuesday, but woult again be given eight hours notice. This action and other incident! demonstrate once again that the Em ployers' Federation in W.A. is PW ing a particularly vicious role— ever on some occasions standing over m dividual employers— to ensure tha victimised men are not re-instatec under any circumstances. 'Their position is made stronger bj the present Arbitration Act fro® which the power to order re-instax ment of victimised workers was r moved by the Liberal Governme in 1963.
