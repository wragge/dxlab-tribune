 Ice cream salesmen strike for more money QYDNEY: About 60 van salesmen for Streets Ice Cream Pty. Ltd. went on strike last Friday in Syd ney in support of a demand for in- creased commission rates. The Milk and Ice Carters Union of NSW has unsuccessfully negotiated this demand with the company since June last year. Streets Ice Cream is controlled by Unilever, the giant British1 soap monopoly. The men are demanding that Streets pay an extra i per cent increase in commission rates plus. 3d for each empty can returned. If granted the claim would mean an average increase from £3 to £4 a week. Dairy Farmers Ice Cream Ltd. have been paying these rates since Febru ary last year following a stoppage. The Streets' men also say that the Dairy Farmers van salesmen have an assistant on the truck and they have not.
