 Curtin, not Churchill IN view of the sudden campaign around the Churchill Memo rial Fund, I must express the view that the late John Curtin, Labor wartime Prime Minister, did more for Australia in that period than Churchill or any > other man. If one asks why, then, the fund is not a Curtin Memorial Fund, perhaps it is because most of his support came from workers, who could not afford the necessary mnnpv in nnv ras G.F. (Port Macquarie).
