 Support for Vietnam leaflet Â¥ WAS distributing a Communist leaflet on Vietnam in Martin Place, .Sydney, when an elderly woman told me that for genera- tions the flower of her family had been wiped out by war and that she was glad to see women doing something about it as last. During this conversation a street cleaner chided the distributor about the work being made for him because of the leaflets which some of the people threw down. The elderly woman broke in, ' speaking directly to the man: "We can think ourselves lucky that it is . paper littering the footpath, instead of blood and bodies as I saw in. London during the last war." Helper (Sydney).
