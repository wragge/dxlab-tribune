 Wrong sacking could stop work throughout WA pERTH: The WA Trades and Labor Council has reacted sharply to the arrogant refusal of Broken Hill Pty. to reinstate a victimised worker and even to take part in a Magistrate's inquiry, as suggested by Indus trial Commissioner Schnaars. At its meeting on February 16 the Council endorsed a recommendation from its Disputes Committee that it be given authority to call a statewide stoppage of work if it received clear evidence of any worker being wrongfully dismissed in the future. The Council would retain this authority until the Industrial Arbit ration Act was amended to pro vide just and reasonable protec tion to victimised workers. The dispute at B.H.P. began with the sacking of truckdriver Anthony for allegedly leaving his truck to look at his parked car. After a series of stoppages by B.H.P. workers Commissioner Sch naars recommended xe-instatement and when the B.H.P. refused he suggested the Magistrates enquiry. The Brand Liberal Government bears a great deal of the responsibi lity for this position as its amend ments to the Arbitration Act (which provoked the general stoppage in late 1963) removed the protection that previously existed. The B.H.P. issue is now closed as Mr. Anthony has now asked the T.L.C. and his union not to take any further action because of the adverse publicity it had brought him and his family. He said he would not take em ployment again with the B.H.P. Evidence of the vicious nature ol victimisation by " employers was given by -a young metal worker who recently went to the eastern states for a short period. He had previously been victimised in W.A. fox his union activities and a West Australian firm had sent his name to their branch in the eastern states. On this occasion, however, action by the men prevented any furthei victimisation.
