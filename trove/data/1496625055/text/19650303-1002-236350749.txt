 loo Communists' plan for locality CYDNEY : An all-round policy for redevelopment of the inner suburb of Woolloomoo- loo, to allow for the needs of progress while protecting the interests of the worker - resi dents, has been announced by the Communist Party's local branch. The Party has been giving full sup port to the Progress Association's campaign of opposition to a bad scheme for high-density development by an English monopoly firm. The Communist policy is: â€” 1. Full development to be carried out by Government, through Housing Commissions, City Council and similar agencies. 2. Full ' compensation at market values to all citizens. 3. Adequate safeguards for those renting premises. Provision of adequ ate accommodation in close proximity until new housing in this area is avail- able, financial safeguards to be suf ficient to cover all removal expenses and other inconveniences. 4. First preference for new housing in the area be given to former home owners and tenants to resettle. Rent als of such new housing to be at rates which ordinary working people can pay without hardship. 5. Such redevelopment schemes to make provision for parks, play grounds, child care centres, shopping facilities and other amenities. Present shopkeepers to have first option on new premises. 6. The Federal Government to be required to provide larger financial allocation for such re-development schemes. This to replace the present policy of making it as easy as possible for big business to squeeze out local resi dents for luxury housing for the privileged and the acquiring of huge profits. (This is being done not just in the 'Loo but all over Australia.)
