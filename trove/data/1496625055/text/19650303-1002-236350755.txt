 [?] j JHE basic solution to I existing problems is j a socialist Australia, I but meanwhile Austra- ! lia can be made a bet- J ter place by consistent | activity directed I against the wealthy 1 monopolies. Commun- ! ists in Parliament can ! help achieve this. ! . This important viewpoint I was expressed to thous ands of Adelaide TV | viewers over Channel 7 S when the Communist can- didates were interviewed I last week. I The team consisting of Mr. El- I hot Johnston (Adelaide), Mr. J Peter Symon (Port Adelaide) ! Mr. Alan Miller (Enfield) and I Mr. Brian Rooney (Gumeracha) J made the following points: J 9 The main issue in the elec- | tions is to defeat the Playford | Liberal Government. ! 9 Playford represents mono-' j poly and helps them with public money. ! e Big business wields enorm- I ous power in its own selfish in- | terests. I 9 This power should be curb- 1 ed and broken up by nationalisa- | tion. 2 9 The money thus provided . J could expand social services for | the people. | 9 War spending affects State e development. Hence a peaceful S foreign policy would release mil- | lions of pounds for schools, hos- j pitals and other needs. = 9 Living standards must - be I increased by higher wages, price | control and equal pay as these | would benefit not only workers. | but small business people who 1 rely upon the spending power of | people. | 9 The Playford gerrymander ! is an affront to democracy and | there should be one vote one | value, proportional representa- | tion and abolition of the Upper House. I Apart.from TV, the Communist j Party has put forward its view in j an attractive leaflet, by the hold- | ing of a series of factory gate meetings shopping centre meet- j ings and the holding of a success- | ful Central Public Meeting at 1 which £130 was raised. $ The Party has been stressing jj that the best vote against Play- i ford and for working class policy ! is the Communist vote. Such a jj vote is not wasted if the CPA 2 candidate fails to be elected as S the second preference to the I ALP becomes a number one vote, | as long as the How-to-Vote card ? is carried out. I The CPA how to vote is: | ADELAIDE: Basisovs G. 4, El- | lis T. E. 3, Johnston E. F. 1, ! "awn S. J. 2. f PORT ADELAIDE: Boys D. R. i 3, Rvan J. R. 2, Symon P. D. I. !
