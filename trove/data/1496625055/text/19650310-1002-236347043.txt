 More democracy in the UAR TUOW that the United Arab Re public has been proclaimed a Democratic Republic with social ism as its objective, I hope that there will be greater democracy than existed in the 1940's. In 1943 an Egyptian Communist was arraigned before the court for displaying for sale or selling "Col lective Farming in the Soviet Union" at the Le Rond Point Book shop, . Cairo. In 1949, friends were told that the bookseller and his wife had been interned. The continued imprisonment of Communists by Republican Egypt was a grievous mistake and their release must be counted as a vic tory for democracy. One does not suggest that there is "workers' power" in Egypt, but the completion of the Aswan High Dam will bring irrigation to two million acres of desert land and the advent , of : hydro-electricity will be the economic basis to make it pos sible to demolish the mud huts of: the agricultural villages and build- better dwellings with which electric light, power, water and sewerage can be properly, connected, The prospect of diplomatic recog nition of the German Democratic Republic, by the U.A.R. augurs well for Egyptian socialism and interna tional peace. The forthcoming Afro-Asian Con ference in Algiers is very important and I hope as a result that the United Nations .will be strengthened. Integration of .all nations within U.N.O. is the best guarantee of a ban on nuclear weapons and the establishment of nuclear free zones. "Try for Peace" (South Ilurstville, Sydney).
