 Wouldn't do for the Duke CONSIDERING the general level of intelligence among dukes, it Is not bad that one of them has woken up to the fact that the world stands in danger of total destruction by the products of scientific invention under condi tions of bourgeois rule. "Technology has given us vastly improved means to give expression to our anger and jealousy, our pride and covetousness. We can control everything in our world except ouselves," Edinburgh said in his Dunrossil lecture re cently. The Duke could pose the prob lem â€” and that exhausted his mental energies for the evening. The answer was too much to expect from him or, do him jus tice, from even the greatest brains of the bourgeoisie who are as bankrupt as he is when they face the central social question of the day. What stumps the princes, parsons and professors, however, is no mys tery to the workers, of whom mil lions have mastered the central truths of Marxism The problem the Duke thrashed, his brains over that night was solved years ago by Marx and Engels. . In Socialism Utopian and Scien tific, Engels wrote "With the seizing of the means of production by society, production of commodities is done away with and, simultan eously, the mastery of the product over the produced . . . The whole sphere of conditions of life which environ man and which have hither to ruled man now comes under the dominion and control of man, who, for the first time becomes the real conscious lord of Nature because he has now become master of his own social organisation ... It is the ascent of man from the kind- dom of necessity to the kingdom of freedom." In making that ascent, however, we can't take feudal hangovers with us. It's a solution, therefore, that won't do for the Duke. That doesn't prevent it being very acceptable to hundreds of millions of othefS as the only way through the dangers of today's world. B.L.G.
