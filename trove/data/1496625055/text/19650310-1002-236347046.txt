 Mt. Isa's hot prices J MET a Franch woman from Mt. Isa recently. She, her hus band and there little boy live there in two small rooms and a caravan for £8/10/- a week. Outside, everything is filthy from the smoke from the works nearby. She says they need £10 to £12 a week for food alone — for example, milk 1/4 a pint, bread 2/- a loaf, tomatoes 3/4, oranges 6/6 a dozen, large lemonade 2/6 a bottle. Prices are high, she says, because of transporting costs and there should be a concession freight on the railway. All the talk about "big money" there is lies, she said. It's a sun- smitten place, hot, and if you want to hire an air-conditionaling house hold plant for two rooms, its £6 a week.- -Sydneysider.
