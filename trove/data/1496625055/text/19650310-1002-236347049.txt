 Salute! SALUTE to Ireland on winning her latest battle against im perial England— for the return to their proper restingplace of patriot Roger Casement's remains. Casement was a consistent anti- imperialist freedom- fighter, not just an anti-Briton. He exposed the Belgian crimes in the Congo as well as the English crimes in Ireland. Has anybody fought better or suf fered more in the independence struggle than the Irish? They surviv ed Queen Elizabeth, Oliver Crom well and the Black and Tans, not to mention the . genocidal absentee landlords of 100 years- ago who, forced half the Irish to starve or emigrate. After many centuries of struggle, 26 counties are free and the other six might be following them in the not too distant future, on present indications. Besides all this the Irish found time to contribute to other people's efforts to be free. Irishmen (notably Lalor) fought at Eureka. And before that (161 years ago tomorrow) at Castle Hill, near Sydney, they first raised a flag of freedom in what was then a slave-camn colonv. — P.L.J. (King's Cross).
