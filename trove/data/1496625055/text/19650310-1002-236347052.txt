 A point for I Churchill appeal 11 WE hear a lot about the un- H ie u controllable youth of today. It I bHnLCafUS,e any yo.unS People are if Cnn« J, 5 rubbish of an alien i boofecLii n as the trash on the I ararnm8 and bad TV pro- | ? amines, as well as the RSL tak- ing parental interests away from the youth? It is of course disgusting to walk through suburban streets and see results of hoodlum activity as seen recently -in our district. If our youth, the citizens of to morrow, were given a fair deal with proper centres for their use with clean energetic entertainments, the hoodlum would soon disappear. The sum of £30,000 is earmarked to be spent on a Youth Centre at Rockdale, but the plans are not yet ready. This is something in the future whilst the need for such places is long overdue today. Many suburbs have closed picture shows and empty shops. With pro per amenities these could be turned into youth centres. Our beaches and parks could be flood-lit and, with well conducted entertainment in good weather the youth, as well as older people, could find relaxation and enjoyment there from. Couldn't some of the money from the CHURCHILL APPEAL be well spent for the education and enjoy ment of our youth TODAY? tusie Leahy (Kamsgate, Sydney), For Union of Australian Women.
