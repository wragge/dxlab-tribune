 [?] il With JUDAH WATEN j ;l l I INDIA | S i I tj \A/E left India on the i ' steamer "Erfurt" from !j Mermagoa in Goa. fj Mermagoa Port, like the near- li by town of Vasco da Gama, has 1 recently been the scene of strikes J and demonstrations. ? j The police fired on one demon- ! stration killing one worker and J injuring a number. . \| Subsequently the militant lead- , i ers, the Dock and Transport 'i! workers Union, were jailed y under the defence of India rules, \Sj a shameless device for suppress- I' ing civil liberties and political Jl opposition. Hi In Vasco da Gama there were IS red and black flags flying from m buildings in honour of the jailed leaders ...and, banners . demanding 1 1 their release. j! In the same town on many || walls there were posters advert- j| ising a festival of Soviet films. ,«| Actually the festival had ended and it had been a tremendous £fl success. Dr. Dias, a hero of the ;l| struggle against the Portugese 4j and the editor of the local pro- JS gressive weekly "Luta", told us 4 1 that hundreds had been unable to j get in, and another festival was ; 1 1 contemplated. ,|j In India the film is the only j | popular form of entertainment. J I There is no television and 4 1 theatre, music "and classical I j dancing are patronised by a tiny I I section of the community. I ! Most of the films to be seen are 1 1 produced in India which has one I j of the largest film industries in I S the world. Of these a majority I I are, of course, commercial enter- I | tainment although I did not find I | those I saw as unreal as the I I American product. I _ The serious films are of an ex- j tremely high social and artistic j order. ! The recent "Mahanagar" pro- I duced by Satyajit Ray, one of | India's greatest film producers | and chairman of the Internation- | al Film Festival, presents real- | istically the life of a pauperised S middle class family; the changes ) that poverty brings about in the | family including those that arise = out of the destruction of tradi- I tionally held beliefs about the I place of women. - I We saw. another outstanding I film, "Hamora Ghar", produced I by K. A. Abbas who is also a j novelist and a regular contributor | to the independent weekly | "Blitz", the scourge of India's | reactionaries. | Wherever we went in India we | met people who knew one or | other of our writers, James | Aldridge, Jack Lindsay and | Frank Hardy. In several homes S we saw Frank Hardy's "Power j Without Glory". j From my experience realist | and progressive writers, Indian S and foreign, are the most favour- | ed by writers and readers in I India, even in conservative | circles. | The task of writers was sum- | med up by the Bengali writer ft Bannerjee at the recent PEN g Congress: "We can activise the I spirit, make it dream new | dreams of the future and take g .. .better stock of the realities of | the present." $ NOTE: Judah Waten has won I the £200 Volkswagen award for i his novel "Distant Land". The g judges praised its warm human I atmosphere in treating the prob- | lems of a refugee family estab- g lishing itself in Australia. !
