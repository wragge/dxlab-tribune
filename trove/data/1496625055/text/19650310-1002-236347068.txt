 Moree's color bar stays on SYDNEY: The Town Clerk off Moree ffhis week confirmed to Tribune that the Mayor and Council had already delayed the idea ot rescind ing the existing regulation banning Aborigines from the Council's baths and memor ial hall. Recently, when Sydney students de monstrated against the color bar at Moree baths, the Mayor (Aid. W. Lloyd) undertook to move for the rescission of the regulation. This week the Town Clerk said that the Mayor, after consulting auth- orities in education, health, the Ah- original Welfare Board and the Abori gines themselves, would bring down "a motion that would make every body happy." However, a former alderman, _ Mr. R. Brown, who has been actively working to end race discrimination in the town, said later that he would he surprised if the present council ever rescinded the minute banning Abori gines from the baths. Mr. Brown said that in his opinion, the Mayor only wanted to "hush up the matter and let it die." "I have received advice that the ban placed on the baths by the coun cil is illegal," Mr. Brown said. Mr. Brown said that even favoured Aborigines were not allowed into the baths any more. His own shop had been plastered with rubbish and there were still rumours in the town that his brother's house was going to he bombed, he said.
