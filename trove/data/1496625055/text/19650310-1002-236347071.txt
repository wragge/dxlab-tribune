 » « j— j'Who's going! I to stop mel'j i Sydney Waterside worker Terry Hickman told j Tribune last week he had been warned in Armi- j | dale (northern New South Wales) not to walk | | along the main street with an Aboriginal girl. j | TERRY was a shearer in I New South Wales and Southern Queensland for I seven years before becom- | injg a wharfie last year. | "I didn't even have my arm... I around her. I wasn't touching | her." I As we went along a waggon pull ed up with two policemen in it. | One said: "You can't walk along S here with her, she's part Aborigin- 1 al." ! I said: "Who's going to stop -J me?" I "No-one has to stop you. There's j a law against it." I "You can please yourself what iyou do about that," I said "she's a friend of mine and I'm staying with her." I After that every time I put my nose inside that town I was book- | ed by these policemen for speed- | ing, parking, not putting my hand | out— anything at all. I "If you associate with Aborigines I you get shunned, and if you take j a girl out, well, you're barred. | "In Moree Aborigines have to | leave the town by midnight Sat- | urday night— some of them come I back in for church service next j morning. i'Tve been in a pub in Moree and heard a knock at the back door. The publican goes under the I counter for two bottles of plonk— they won't serve them in the bar. "They say Aborigines are lazy, and they don't like to work hard all the time. Well who does? i "If you'd been living off the land j for centuries, and if it was bred | into you to take things as they i come, you wouldn't think there | was much sense in hard work, I either. Especially if you were get- I ting a coloured, discriminated wage, arid could buy nothing good ! with it. I "But I've known Aborigines | who'd work as hard as any man. I "They're frightened to speak out | in many ways, but they're not un- i educated as far as their rights go. g They know what it means to have .! a go at the boss. i "They'll never leave you short 1 . of a feed either. They'll look after | you when you're broke. j "Take the boxing tents in the j country. The white man always | gets the purse— £3 or something. I The dark man's gotta take his 10/- | or a £1 and be a punching bag. j Most of them are better fighters | than us too, they've proved it. | "Say there's two fighters in a i ring, white and black. g "The crowd's geeing up the | white fella, the referee's (already ? discriminating on money) pushing S the dark fella round too. J "I've seen an Aborigine win and ! . get booed out of the ring. Called | a dirty fighter — after the other I fella's been kneeing him and rab- | bit-killing him all the fight. j "Why should they fight to win? j They might get a gang on their | backs. j "It's injustice, that's all it is."
