 New trial to "Ian hysteria" NEW YORK: The new trial of the Communist Party of the USA is aimed at gagging opposition to the Government's war on Vietnam, Gus Hall said at a press conference last week. "-THE new charge against the Party on the Mc- Carron Act is an attempt to create an atmosphere of hys teria in order to gag all oppo sition to the unpopular, unde clared and therefore unjust and unconstitutional war in South Vietnam", Mr. Hall, leader of the American Communist Party, told a press conference. He stressed that the new round of persecution of American Communists constituted capitulation to the extreme rightists, a betrayal of the mandate re ceived at the elections and a fresh attempt to destroy all political free doms. "The policy of aggression in South Vietnam isolated the United States from all who stand for peace. This political prosecution still more isolates the United States from those who stand for democracy. We intend to continue de fending the constitutional rights of Americans fighting against this coercion and persecution," Hall said. A statement by the Gus Hall- Benjamin Davis Defence Committee says: With one trial of the Communist Party to take place on March 16, a Grand Jury has returned a second in dictment â€” this one technically based on the Communist Party's failure to register during the period from Feb ruary 13 to '23, 1965. The new element in this indictment is the Justice De partment's contention that an alleged "volunteer" is available who is willing to register the Party. Competent observers say that this new thrust against the liberties of the people under the McCarran Act will be defeated just as some other pro visions of the Act have already been ruled unconstitutional,
