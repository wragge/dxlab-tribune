 Stopwork to help Isa men WOLLONGONG: Workers at the Tallawarra Power Station on the NSW South Coast stopped work a quarter of an hour early last Wednes- day to enable a 5/- levy for Mt. Isa to be collected. This followed an edict from the Superintendent that no collections could be taken up on the job. The workers have been giving 5/- a week over the past six weeks for the Mt. Isa men. Last Friday a mass meeting at the power house was addressed by Mrs. O. Gates, a mother of three children and wife of a Mt. Isa miner. The meeting called on the South Coast Labor Council to press the Aus tralian Council of Trade Unions -to call a national 24 hour stoppage "to bring the Mt. Isa issue to a head." In a demand for nationalisation of Mt. Isa, the meeting said that this US company is now further exploiting Australia by selling us copper at double the Australian price.
