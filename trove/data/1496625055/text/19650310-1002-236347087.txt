 ' |i| I "Gold Medal Girl"! j By The Challenger I yHILE the inter- ! national dismay and S discussion goes on 1 over the savage pen- I alties by the Austra- j lian Swimming Union j against Dawn Fraser I and three other girl j champions, it is a good j moment to take a clo- J ser look at the real I meaning of the career I of Dawn Fraser. I Today's youngsters with aspir- | ations_ _of _ becoming a sporting I "great" should first read Gofcl | Medal Girl", the story of Dawn | Fraser, acclaimed the world's I greatest swimmer. (Our copy | came from New World Booksell- I ers, 425 Pitt St., Sydney). J After reading the book they S should realise that at the basis I of all the glory, publicity, and I good time shennanigans, lies a j vast ocean of severe, disciplined I training. I The book, "Gold Medal Girl", | reveals not only the science and | dedication, that forms one of the | main essentials of successful | world class swimming, but also I gives , a picture of Dawn Fraser's | personality. I It is indeed somewhat regret- S table, that the far-reaching signi- I ficance of Dawn Fraser's achieve- I ments is not seen more clearly | by people. I It is not only a case of "Dawn I Fraser did a lot for swimming I and swimming did a lot for Dawn | Fraser", but a case of Dawn, | through her achievements doing I a tremendous amount for women | in general. i What better way to advance the I right of women, to equality than I by proving it in a field of ; com- j petition, swimming, in which I men have a distinct biological ad- | vantage? I Dawn Fraser has broken more 1 than forty world records, and is I the only swimmer, male or j female, ever to win an Olympic j championship three times in a | row. J Also the record books show I that she can swim faster than I Johnny Weissmuller could at his | peak — the Johnny Weissmuller I who collected more gold medals | than any other Olympic swim- | mer. I In 1957, the times Dawn Fraser I and Lorraine Crapp were swim- ming would have won the men's 11 championships in most European Iff countries. Ig In 1960 Dawn Fraser's times at fj the national championships caus- fl ed Australia's chief selector to Iff say, "Dawn is faster than some if of the men we'll select in our If Olympic team". "m The history of Dawn's swim- m ming career, has been one of | constant struggle against adver- Jl sity. She has since her child- 1 hood suffered from asthma and Iff her whole career it seems has Iff been one continuous running 1 battle with officialdom, II Through her many encounters |1 with swimming officials and the | ensuing publicity, Dawn has be- ||| come known as a non-conformist, |i a kind of swimming rebel. l|| Her non-conformist actions 11 though are not based on petty self- m - seeking, publicity. ,but 0n.an.J3n.n- Lit est acceptance of swimming facts derived by her from her own ex- j it perience in the game. || She admits to mistakes, but in pi the majority of the cases of J trouble cited against her by the M officials, she is vindicated by the logic of her explanations, which -1 shows an intimate and thorough % understanding of all facets of H swimming. % To quote Dawn: "Australian of- ficials don't like swimmers to || question their decisions or their $ attitudes. Ideally, they'd like to &lt; j use athletic puppets — but they \ are willing to settle for young v schoolchildren who are happy to M let the grown-ups do all the if thinking". II Also . ... "I slept beside a pool and ate beside a pool, and train- j ed in a pool before I went to . work and after I finished work, ; $ and during my lunch hour. m : "It involved a lot of hardship and loneliness and sacrifice. And || nowadays when someone sug- |S gests that I've infringed my || amateur status, I remember || those days — and I. feel a little S bitter.' IB "I feel that half these pompous, M .petty officials will never know 11 what my kind of amateurism is. gj They'll never know because they if have never had to 'live' swim- |i ming". ll ? I As to the ASU penalties, there M is no doubt of the widespread fl public view in Australia and over- seas (e.g. in Japan and the USA) || that, whatever the "offences" fl may have been, the severity of || the penalties cannot be justified 8 and should be reviewed. || Last week, I saw something of |d this public reaction at its high- i est level in her own home terri- | tory, Balmain, where she appear- | ed by invitation of her old club, g the Birchgrove Ladies', in the || recently-renamed Dawn Fraser gj Swimming Pool. $ The hundreds of spectators \\ there, old and young, were with her, and could be heard con- demning officials who claimed || the right to deprive amateur |i | swimming of such outstanding |f champions. li But what was, perhaps, more 1 IJ| impressive was Dawn Fraser's f|| own cheerful and modest de- fm meanour as, besieged by young M admirers and doubtless weighed || down by the press controversy, m she swam her demonstration lim laps with unsurpossed power and smoothness, and then thorough- ;|9 ly enjoyed a water polo match as || an ordinary team member of Jf Birchgrove, against Parramatta. m It is impossible to believe that || such an unassuming girl can he || in fact some kind of "menace" to m the sport. More likely the real m menace is in the bankrupt lead- M -chip of ASU officialdom. Si j . DAWN FRASER
