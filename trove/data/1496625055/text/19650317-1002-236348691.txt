 Big Perth response far Ml. Esa men PERTH: "The Mt. Isa struggle has shown already that repressive legislation and penal clauses can be defeated." "THIS statement by Queensland Trades and Labor Council President J. Egerton brought enthusiastic applause from a big audience at the Perth Trades Hall after the annual Labor Day march on March 1 . "There are 50 per cent New Austra lians among the Mt. Isa miners — mainly Finns, Hungarians and Poles - and they re in many ways teach ing us how to fight," he said. This again brought vigorous ap plause and at the end of the meeting a spontaneous throw-in of pound notes resulted in a collection of £53. Gver £50,000 has already been sub scribed from all over Australia, but much more was needed to sustain the families of the locked-out miners, Mr. Egerton said. The Mt. Isa fight was a legitimate dispute, in which the workers had finally no other avenue but to use their industrial strength in defencr of trade union rights. Support for Mt. Isa miners was featured by the Amalgamated En gineering Union and Waterside Workers in floats in the Labor Day procession, which was organised for the first time by the WA., Trades ard Labor Council. Workers dissatisfaction with wage levels was the main target of slogans Building workers demanded over- award payments of £5, price control and a "fair share of Brand 'pros perity'.". Equal pay and opportunity for women, and a fair deal for Abori gines were other demands. An outstanding float was from the Union . of Australian Women on in ternational co-operation, and an end to conscription for overseas service was demanded. A.E.U. slogans included "No Aussie Blood to save Rich Investors in Asia", and "Repeal Anti-Union Arbitration Act". The short time available for pre paration for the march cut down the scope of floats this year.
