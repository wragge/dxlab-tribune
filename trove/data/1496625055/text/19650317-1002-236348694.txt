 Freedom for Aborigines QNE POINT in connection with the recent fact-finding survey into the living conditions of abori gines in the north of the State carried out by the university stu- dents does not appear to have beâ€”-' mentioned, but it seems to me to he very important. Australia (like the U.S.) claims to be fighting for freedom for Asians in countries like South Viet nam and Borneo; but these claims must surely be received with the utmost suspicion by most Asians when they read, as read they must, of the very poor living-conditions of Australians aborigines, and the undoubted discrimination against them as revealed by this survey. (The same also applies to the neg roes in America, of course). Purely from the point of view ot self-interest in relation with their dealings with Asians (to say noth ing of the moral obligation), Aus tralians should be demanding that aborigines should be given equality of opportunity with white Austra lians in every sphere, the same living conditions enjoyed by whites and an absolute end to all forms of discrimination. It's another subject, of course, but Australian soldiers should not be Tin Asia at all. Ross (Sydney).
