 SB By EILEEN ALLISON 7HE Screen Actors' Guild of America keeps a careful record of its members' earn ings. It has just published a report showing that screen act ors have earned £26,000,000 during the past year. Of that sum, £6,500,000 has been earned by actors making films in Hollywood for the cinemas: £8,750,000 earned by actors appearing in film series for TV networks; and £10,750,000 by actors doing no more than make the commercials for TV. Dana Andrews, president for the Guild, said: "It is sad news for us who work solely as actors . . . The situation is getting progres sively worse and we must calmly and reasonably press for a solu tion." Any society that can" pay creative artists more to sell detergents than to give great dramatic performances is cancerous, rotten from within. And don't smugly think this is only \ an American disease. It happens in Australia, too. Some of our best actors are seen more often in adverts thp- in dramas and comedies. No wonder that Actors' Equity and other trade unions are among the sponsors of next Saturday's T.V . Congress. Our. actors and acresses must be guaranteed a T.V. quota that will enable them to use their talents in real creative work. A .T.N. CHANNEL 7 has com- menced a series of comedy classics each Sunday at approxi mately 9.45 p.m. Last Sunday, W. C. Fields appear ed in "THE BANK DICK". It was a screamingly funny film s.ith Fields at the top of his form. X These old comedies are funnier and healthier than most of the films dished up today. Future films in this series in udc Pone Clair's NIGHT BEAD TIES and \Y. C Fields with Mae West in MX LITTLE CH1CK- &DEE.
