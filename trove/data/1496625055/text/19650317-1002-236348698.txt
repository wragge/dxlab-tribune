 Television Congress 'T'HE forthcoming National T.V. Congress will, I hope, do much more than study and dis cuss the Vincent Report. Definite plans aimed at gaming public support for protecting and improving the cultural life of this country should be made. The monopolies who either own or control the main cultural, ' news and information media, consciously and deliberately use them as their main ideological weapons in' the class struggle distort or suppress progressive ideas and facts. The crucial issue is not only the impoverished and frustrating posi tion of our writers, actors and pro ducers, or even the threatened sub mergence of the Australian National character, but tli. extent to which T.V., radio, the theatre, films, newspapers, etc., can be compelled to reflect reality and provide faci lities for the expressing of progres sive opinion, plays, etc. at the pre sent stage in society. The coming Congress will bring together organisations and people who have many talents necessary to explain their case to the Australian public, with a view to enlisting support. Through leaflets, speakers, plays and many other ways, they can tell the people the true facts about the growing crisis in the cultural life of this country. They should contact and secure the support of trade unions, youth, civic and church organisations to arrange meetings, the distribution of leaflets and to seek action through deputations, petitions, let ters, resolutions, etc., to their Members of Parliament, radio and T.V. stations and the Press. This means a well organised national campaign, initially to gain public support and then forcing a radical change in the attitude of the Federal Government and its ap pointees, and the "profits before patriotism" philosophy of those who control our commercial T.V. and radio networks. Such a campaign must emphasise the need for a very much larger government-backed film industry in Aiic?frolio i Peter CundaK (Tas.), j
