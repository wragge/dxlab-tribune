 I TRIBUNE I |Way out in Vietnam I 5 | "JHE call of the Australian Anglican bishops (see Page 1 ) ! I » I Australian action against the present American ! j spread the war course in Vietnam is an important ? I pointer to rapid widening of the public concern around this ! I issue, in the interests of peace. | j This concern has been expressed also in recent weeks ! | in many press editorials, trade urtion declarations, Labor I | Party nolicy statements and in continuing demonstrations | outside US consulate's and now at Federal Parliament. | i The proposals are many and varied, but they have two j | thinqs in common — alarm at the- threat to world peace I i involved in the accelerating US acts of 'aggression against i | North Vietnam; and a desire for some form of peaceful | | solution before these acts escalate into a big war. j ! u- ,/Avmon9 t'ne statements are some, including those of the ! | bishops and also the Labor Party leaders, which speak « | of ; the United States as "Australia's great ally" — a pro- f j position with which many Australians, including the Com- f | munists, disagree. | | But despite this disagreement, support for the common ! emes PVibl ic demand for peace is an urgent duty for I | Each new public statement of this kind influences new I j sections of people to move into some form of action. This, | | in practice, is the development of unity for peace. j j Anyone who, because of narrow prejudice, is unable to £ j se. that simple' truth is doing a bad service to both the j j A, ,ctra!ian people and the people of Vietnam and elsewhere | t in Asia. I ! ? ! 1 e | The present US drive to a big war can be halted by the I j q rowing world mass movement around the Vietnam issue, j j combined with the struggle of the South Vietnamese people J | for independence and with the defensive military measures j | of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, aided by the j j Soviet Union and other socialist countries. j j The agreement between the Soviet and French Govern- | ments to seek a reconvening of the Geneva Conference to | 2 n-qotiate a new settlement is the most significant concrete j | new move in the search for a solution to the crisis. ! 2 It is important to note this statement by the Soviet I .= Ambassador in Paris: ". . . a new Geneva. conference could j ! not work if bombings accompanied the meeting." That is, I a halt to US raids on North Vietnam is a condition of the I | proDosal. | I However, the very basis of the Geneva Agreement is | I respect for the sovereign independence and territorial in- £ | tegrity of Vietnam, its unity and neutrality, and its right to j jj be rid of all foreign troops, bases and military entangle- j | ments. j | Hence, implicit in the demand for a return to Geneva j j is the principle that the US (and Australian) forces must s j leave Vietnam. ! | Whatever course the internal politics of Vietnam then ? j follow is entirely a matter for the Vietnamese people, and j I Australia must adopt a policy of peaceful co-existence with j 1 them, and with all other nations. | !
