 TOP CHURCHMEN I ADD CALL FOR I VIETNAM PEACE 1 An appeal by 1 1 Australian bishops and archbishops 3 to the Menzies Government to act for peace in Viet- | nam has strengthened the great world public demand | to stop expansion of the war and ensure negotiations. | The appeal came this week, at the moment $ when the United States, standing almost 4 alone in its refusal to negotiate, launched a -I new wave of unprovoked air bombing attacks against Morth Viefnam. Following demonstrations in Sydney and Melbourne last J week against conscription of 20-year-olds for overseas service, 'I on Monday and Tuesday this week in Sydney young people combined in the first off a series of demonstrations at the US V Consulate against US air raids on Vietnam. \ The week's important new steps in the struggle to halt rJ the US "spread the war" policy have included: A joint statement by the Soviet and French Govern- "4 "merits that they will seek a new meeting .of the Geneva Con- $ ference on Indo-China. A proposal by United Nations Secretary-General U rfl Thant for preliminary talks on Vietnam, attended by the | USA, USSR, China, France, Britain and North and South J Vietnam. (The New York Times backed the plan, but US President Johnson instantly rejected it.) \ France has fold the USA she will get no help from France 4 iff she gets into a war with China over Vietnam, ll Other pressures for a peaceful solution have come from fl the Pope, the World Council of Churches, and the Canadian, 1 Indian and other governments. ml jjj THE Anglican leaders' letter || to the Prime Minister reads: S| "There are a number of us deeply || concerned that our Government || .should be seen to be taking positive || steps, with others, towards an hon- |1 orable and peaceful settlement of || the fighting in T"ietnam. jji "Already His Holiness the Pope, m the Secretary-General of the United If Nations (U Thant) and the Govern- || ments of Canada, India and France ||| have urged through both private 1 1| and formal diplomatic channels their || earnest desire for negotiations lead- ! ing to peace. . If "We are not. concerned here to II canvass the merits of the respective l| attitudes of the North and South II Vietnamese Governments, or of the II Governments of the 'United States || and China. ' H "We have in mind, however, the pl attitude of Her Majesty's Govern- |g| nient in the United Kingdom at the III me of the Geneva Agreement in P 1954, and since. || "We also realise that liberal B ®Pinin in the U.S.A., as reflected fl b-v the 'New York Times' and by II sober commentators like Mr. Walter Ihippmann, by no means agree with tneir Government's policy. Although the U.S.A. was not a signatory to the 1954 Geneva Agree ments, in a statement made, on 21st Ply that year they undertook to re- H fnam from threat of the use of IH «ce in the matter of Vietnam.
