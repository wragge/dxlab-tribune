This was slated during a -conference between the building unions and rep resentatives of the Master Builders' Association. The building unions have been pres sing, for such a scheme for the past six years. The NSW Minister for Labor. Mr. Maloney, has on numerous occasions told the unions that such a scheme was "too difficult" to organise, .even though the unions had submitted what they - believed to be a workable scheme. President of the MBA, Mr A Call, told last week's conference that the MBA supported (lie principle and were prepared to confer with the unions and other employers' organisations to seek a mutually acceptable scheme for pre sentation to the Government. The MBA will examine the unions material for such a scheme and has agreed to call a further conference at an early date. Building Workers' Industrial Union secretary, Mr. P. Clancy, said the re sults of the conference are most en couraging. "T' unions are on entrating on reaching agreement with the employers so that a long service leave scheme which extends elementary justice to building workers can be introduced with the minimum delay. "Continued campaigning- and the sup port of building workers can obtain success on this vital issue," Mr Clancy said.
