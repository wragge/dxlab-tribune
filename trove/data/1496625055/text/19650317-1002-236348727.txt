 BLACK BAN CYDNEY:, A recent mass meet ing of 300 State Electricity Commission maintenance work ers at the main transmission depot at Homebush, Wdnev. called for black bans to be placed on work done by outside contractors. The men are demanding that the, Commission stop handing out work usually done by maintenance wor kers to private contractors. A" meeting of the N3W Labor Council earlier this month decided to seek ? conference with theMin-' ister in charge of the Commission, Mr. P. D. Hills, and that no bans be placed pending this conference. Mr. T. McDonald (Building Wor kers Industrial Union) told Council that workers are not satisfied with the way the Minister has faced up to this problem." "The letting out of work has been extended ever recent years and even jobs of two. days duration , are given to private contractors." "If approaches to the Minister are unsatisfactory council should back the workers demand for a ban," Mr. McDonald said. The State Branch of the BWIU will ask the June Conference cf the Australian Labor Party (NSW) to call a halt to the growing prac tice in Governments of giving work to contractors. The union said this practice is causing considerable unrest among employees in the Maritime Services Board, the Electricity Commission, Government Railways, Public Wor ks Department and other depart ments. Unions say that contractors being i employed on these Government jobs i are employing non-union labour- and I are breaking down job . and safety ' conditions.
