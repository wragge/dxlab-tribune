 [?] | i t j | Judo to disarm | I the bullies j i By "CHALLENGER" j ; J JUDO is usually looked j upon as a sport in which a little fellow can use it to I Drotect himself, and if the i necessity arises throw j /'the big bull/' 10 yards j out of the way just to S teach him a lesson. . ! Des Moore of the Chester- S Hill Yoshin Ryugi judo club i would he really ' able to do a j good job I Des is a six foot two and a I quarter inch fifteen and a half I stone heavyweight who has just | recently competed in the Aus- 1 tralian Capital territory's novice- I judo championships, where he I was beaten in the final by a I competitor from Port Kembla. 1 He is a member of the Eureka | Youth League and is a pre- I sent studying for his Diploma j of Education at Sydney Univer- ! sity. . j The Judo Championships held a fortnight ago were the first = Australian Capital Territory I championships and proved to be- j a big success. j One hundred and fifty com— ! peted from Sydney and three of j the university clubs had mem- | hers competing. = , Ted Boronski, who , won a ! bronze medal at the Tokyo j Olympics, won the heavyweight | championship and also the Aus- S tralia Cup. I That an Olympic medallist j was a competitor is a good indi- | cation of the improved stan- ! dard of Australian judo. t ! And swimmers I THE JUNIOR EUREKA I 1 YOUTH LEAGUE (JEL) | must feel pleased at the per- I formance of one of its mem- I bers in the recent N.S.W. State | swimming championships. The J JEL member is young Lance | Ogston. | In the under ten year old ( events, Lance came second in the fifty metre backstroke and S fourth in the fifty metre butter- I fly. i His second in the backstroke J was only four-tenths of a second S outside the winning time of 39.9 I seconds, while his fourth in the. 1 butterfly was only one-tenth out- 2 side the winning time. | That four youngsters can finish within one-tenth of a | second of each other is a good j example of the keen degree of 1 competition that existed | amongst the 200 odd youngsters 2 who competed in the under ten S year old events. I Science has proved that the | main ingredient for success in i sport today — and especially I v swimming — is hard work. // Young Ogston's success is I J hut the culmination of innura- j erable hours of training and j 1 competiton in week-end swim- j j ming carnivals. j j It is hoped that his persistent j 1 training will pay further divi- s dends for him in the future. ! I D Aussie I b I chickens? i V'EITH MILLER writing in j \ J the Daily Mirror said that j f Australia was not "chucked" | out in the first test hut that the j j Australian hatsmen were some- i f/i what chicken-hearted when fac- I j- J ing the West Indies fast bwl- M ers. | Chicken-hearted or not, two | r Sydney cricketers and a doctor j I J$ have come up with1 a practical j ' solution for a defence against j 'I fast bowling or "chucking" i j J. It is a crash hat with the ad- I / dition of aluminium bars to j | CJl protect the mouth, nose and j M jaw. ' j '1 Said one of the cricketers | after testing the helmet, "I j f | hardly felt a thing when the j 1 ball hit the helmet." ? t >!

B lians, it was Wes Hall who I |p actually broke the Australians' J || defence and finished with a j || match total of 9 wickets for S || 104 I If The tactics it would seem, were j M that Griffith un-nerved the ; || Australians, while Hall bowled | g them. IH Whether the West Indies can j fg| maintain their form for the rest j || of the series, will probably be J ||f to a degree determined by whe: j p|| ther or not Griffith is penalised j |S for throwing (it has been re- j ||| ported that pictorial evidence I |Sj has been produced proving that j ||| he does). j I If this does not happen fans = ||| can expect to see lively series, I ||j that could possible be full of j Ira incidents. j j||
