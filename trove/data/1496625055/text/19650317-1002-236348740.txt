 Ansett grabs D.C.A. staff I CYDNEY: Two of the top public relations men in the Department of Civil Aviation in Melbourne are reported to be switching over to the Ansett payroll Ansett, Australia's biggest pri vate transport monpoly, is evi dently not content with re ceiving unprecedented backing from the Federal Government. They want their trained staff as well. The announcement of record profits for the December half year shows that Ansett Trans port Industries has something to show for this continuous Govt. b-"-ing. The mzies Government has turn'. deaf ear to the demand of the Federal executive of the commercial flying organisations, to stop Ansett expanding into the light aircraft industry. In the space of 24 hours, Com mercial International lost its 9-year franchise handling Piper light aircraft to Ansett. Behind this latest takeover, is Ansett's plan to use this new franchise to move into the charter and training operations and push out completely the small operator. The Federal Secretary of the Australian Commercial Flying Organisations, Mr. J. Bray, said: "We object to the expansionist policy of a Government protected airline which now seeks to con trol yet another branch of Aus- . tralian aviation. "Ansett transport industries Â«s already protected by legislation ensuring 50 per cent of the na tional trunk route traffic. "It controls every scheduled private industry airline opera ting in the Commonwealth ex cept East-West ...Airlines and Connellan Airways." R. ANSETT
