 " I Contributions are gradually risina naniima fund target £1,500 | By JUNE MILLS |"HIS week's contributions to I Trrbune fund show that the I amount from the smaller con- 1 tributions has increased bv | nearly £6 over last week. Then again donations come from as far apart as Cairns and West Aus tralia and this is very good.. I was very touched last week when Alf Ryan, a fine worker for the Trib une "und, called to see me on Inter national Women's Day with two white 1 gardenias. Alf's wife is ill in hospital 1 and all Tribune staff wish her a speedy recovery, r An anonymous donor sent to me | through Ken O'Hara 10/- which I j thought was for the Fund. This week I he sent me £1 and complained that | the previous donation had been paid p into Tribune Fund. I therefore sent | 10/- to Stan Moran's testimonial and I acknowledge the balance of 10/- (per | K.O'I-L) in this week's contributions. 1 We've only got to improve a little /) find average £20 ocld each week for the I next 14 weeks to reach the £1500 target | by June 30th.
