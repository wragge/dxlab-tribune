 Eureka descendant follows tradition fund target £1,500 By JUNE MILLS A DONOR of £5 to the Tri bune Fund this week, "Old Pensioner, WA," whose grand father fouaht in the Eureka Stockade, writes: "I think it's grand to have able ad vocates like you. I feel sure as time goes on women will win equal rights which man has monopolised since he made God in his own image." He also quoted a few lines from a poem he knew: Peace on Earth, Goodwill to all ixmiiKiuUf Those lovely words are heard again, And may their meaning— -ever new, Bring joy to those you love, and you. This week two lots of donations are acknowledged from that tireless work er for Tribune, Butch Wharton. Butch was concerned that the. donation for "Bill Sutton's Short Story" was not acknowledged last week. The reason for this was its late arrival— so both in this issue. It's good to note the improvement in small donations to the Fund and here tribute is paid to another regular collector,' Bill White, who never misses an opportunity to approach people for sales and donations.
