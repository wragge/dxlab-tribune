 Ustashi supporter committed for trial over bombing (IEELONG (Vic.) : A 26-year- old supporter of the Ustashi movement was committed for trial at the Geelong Supreme Court on May 3, following a hearing at the City Court on March 16. - The man, Ambrozije Andric, an in dustrial chemist, was charged with t'- rowing a 'angerous "stink" bomb and an explosive pepper device through a window at the' Geelong West Town Hall where a dance was being held last month to form a Geelong branch of the Yugoslav Set- tiers'-.. Association. This body's policy of favouring the integration of Yugoslav migrants in to the Australian community has earned it the bitter hostility of the Ustashi who oppose naturalisation of migrants from Croatia, Yugosla via, and organise a so-called "libera tion army" with the aim of over throwing the Yugoslav government. According to the evidence, Andric made the bombs himself at his home in the Melbourne suburb of Richmond on Thursday, February 18, and hitch-hiked to Geelong for the dance on the following night. He had walked from North Gee- long to the dance, and thrown the explosives after breaking a window with a half -brick, it was alleged. Andric had been seen by police who arrested him within moments after a chase and a violent struggle. Police said that the dance, attended by between 50 and 60 people, when ' th2 explosions occurred at about 10.10 p.m., had to be abandoned be cause of the "vile smell" from the bombs. Senior-detective John Killeen said' Andric, during an interview at the police station, became agitated when Yugoslavia was mentioned.
