 [?] BY EILEEN ALLISON POURING recent weeks the local TV stations haven't offered "much in adult enter tainment. Some of the, better programs stiii come Trum vncm- nel 2, and last Wednesday it featured the Soviet film "Des tiny of a Man". This excellent production was streets ahead of the films that are re-run on the two commercial chan nels. Last year channel 7 widely adver tised two other Soviet films that were to appear at an early date. These were "Ballad of a Soldier" and "The Cranes are Flying". It is puzzling to understand why their screening has been so long del ayed. Perhaps a few enquiries from the viewers would help. "Impact" (Channel 2, Tuesday 9 p.m.) is a very good, hour-long doc umentary programme. On Tuesday, March 9, it took a look at "the other side of Americaâ€” tne 40 million dollar-poor citizens". Tuesday, March 16, told the horri fying and tragic history of Ireland under British domination. The programme on Tuesday March 23, is titled "The Life and Times of Marshal Tito" and is told by a Brit ish paratroop commander dropped into Yugoslavia in 1943. This series covers a wide field and is well worth watching. Last Saturday "Four Corners" gave an excellent coverage on the crisis in University education. The young people were very eloquent in their appraisal of , the difficulties they en countered both before lnd after en tering university. There is no doubt that they are fully aware of the need to extend the facilities available to students and staff. The students stated that wider Commonwealth grants were essent ial; in fact, they said, a real crisis exists, especially in Melbourne.
