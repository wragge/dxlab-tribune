 Protest meeting rejects scheme CYDNEY: Four hundred people attended the largest pro test meeting ever held in Jan nali last week. Held at the Community Hall the meeting unanimously rejected a pro posed development scheme entailing construction of 10 shops on the rail way station, removal of the station entrance 40 yards downhill and the removal of the bus stop and taxi rank to almost impossible positions. Organised by the Jannali Progress Association in conjunction with the Businessmens and Citizens Welfare Association, they called on the Suther land Shire Council to reject the dev elopment scheme in its present form. Mr, f. Street president of the Pro gress Association, said Council must decide which is most important, the interest of the developers who look after the shareholders or the people who use the railway. Mr. B. Harris who is standing as a Communist candidate in the next council elections, told the meeting that in the opinion of the Communist Party it was time that all organisa tions in Jannali got together to re- plan Jannali in the interests of the community. The night before the meeting the 9 non-Labor Councillors lined up against the 6 Labor Councillors to approve the development scheme submitted by Ox ford Trust. Only 7 of the non-Labor Councillors could vote as two have pecuniary in terest in the development scheme. The Oxford Trust is not a registered company but is a subsidiary of Sun- beach, a company with only £2 paid up capital, yet Oxford Trusts managing agent Mr. Carmichael told the meet ing that the trust so far had paid in £12,500 off the lease to the Rail- -ways Department.
