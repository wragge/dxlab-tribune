 "Out of Vietnam" "QUT OF VIETNAM AND INTO ALABAMA" â€” this sign was carried by a Negro woman in a Civil Rights demonstration and is, in my opinion, the best advice yet . offered to the U.S. Government. I write this in my own interests as a human being who, along with everyone else in the world, is threat ened by the war in Vietnam which could become a world nuclear war. And for what? KJVS MMV VAM V/A MVU.M1 V AVU" nam may enjoy the same "freedom" as the Negroes of the United States? I'm hot willing to die fpr that. Some reports says that Johnson Administration fears loss of pres tige if it gets out of Vietnam. It has already lost more prestige by being so obviously unwilling to get into Alabama.. Anyway, prestige isn't much use to the dead and there will he an awful lot of dead in Washington, - .Canberra, and everywhere else if someone miscalculates in Vietnam. lvirs. j. iuuson (Mosman>.
