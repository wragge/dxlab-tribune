I think we neglect these younger members of the pavement-audience. We make . rosettes for the grown ups, and perhaps we will have some red flags with "May Day" on them, but how about some inexpensive souvenirs of the day for the youngs ters? Many of them will not understand the significance of the cartoons, the banners and floats. How about some gaily decorated little hats? I have seen some made from ordinary sized picnic plates, tied on with red string, tape, "May day" could be written, in red on the crown. Jazz caps for boys, clown shape, and again, the slogan, "May-day, 1965". Little bunches of red flowers, to fasten on with a couple of bobby pins, and a streamer, "May-day". Jazz sticks, with a few bells on the end, or an appropriate slogan, some little red bonnets, for the girls. s. jsanmster (Lawson, N.S.W. ).
