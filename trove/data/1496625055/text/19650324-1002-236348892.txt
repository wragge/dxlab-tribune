 Cigarette IHIIIII lb U|| HI II I MB IH TV advts. F has been announced that the British Labor Government from August 1st this year intended to ban TV advertisements for cigar- ettes and tobacco because of the harm being done to the people's health by smoking. There is partic ular concern for young people. Without doubt TV is being used by the big companies to teach people the "benefits" of smoking, using beautiful scenes and music to ad vertise different brands of cigar ettes. I suggest to all Tribune readers that in the coming State elections a demand be made for the introduc tion of a similar law as in England, and this demand be made to the Commonwealth Government. My wife and I have seven children, ages ranging from 12 to 27 years. We tried to teach them not to smoke, but without success, except with the youngest. What good- can parents do when their efforts are undermined by the advertisements referred to; uco. Muuiouana, (Merewether, NSW).
