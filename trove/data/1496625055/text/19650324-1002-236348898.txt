 | TRIBUNE I I I 0 X 1 . . 2 i Economic signals J ""HE signs are multiplying that the Australian j | economy is sickening. j I Hard on the heels of the recent new increase of the j I bank lending rate — widelv seen as a steD to a new credit I ! squeeze in an attempt to slow down galloping inflation — j 1 has come unprecedented action by the Prime Minister in j I relation to foreign investment in Australia. I ! The United States Government recently moved — J j without consulting its close supporter, the Menzies Gov- j | , — ,„u. — Dj3r&lt;- r„r.t-r;r.jong on i js . direct j | investment, abroad, and urged; return to the USA of a i | h,,n,-«r Drooortion of profits made abroad.' j | Ti--is means, in short, that big firms like General I | Motors-Holden will in future seek to rip more out of Aus- !. | — . Mri/cw; and resources thn they ever did before— L i whirk is certainly saying something! - 1 | It is already common practice for big foreign owners I | t rake their capital for expansion in Australia through | | from the pockets of Australian investors rather than j I bv direct investment from overseas. N « i Put. control of the companies — and the growing profits j j — rornain in the same hands as before, and export of I I pr£,+c increases. j j This means that Australia's overseas balance of pay- | | t is showing a bigger outward drain, and a smaller j | ip"£'&lt;y/ j | Add to that the greatly' increased arms expenditure j j overseas) which, as Tuesday's Sydney Morning I t1"--'-1 admits, has not yet fully made its "impact'' in j = Australia, and the trend is obvious. I l . I J These are some of the reasons why Menzies himself I | the step of writing to President Johnson and asking j j to b "let off" from the impact of the US decision. | | Of course the USA, with its vast, aggressive military I | net o-k abroad, is worried about ITS balance of payments, j | And, as in the case of its disastrous war against Viet- j j r?m US -imperialism is far more concerned about its own j I irf-orpSts than those of any other people — including Aus- s ! tralians. 1 I | S 1 'ttle - wonder that there was an uosume of sharp j I cr tkism of the Government by the Federal Opposition I | D?rliament last week for its failure to "protect" Aus- j tr-T-n interests against the effects of foreign investment, f | which now holds a grip of .up to 93 per cent of certain j | imoortant industries here. | Revstance to. American and other foreign super- I j pvDfoitation of Australia is already a big issue for the f j Australian people but, whether employed by foreign or j j lcal monopolies, Australian workers can expect the worst j I from current economic trends — higher taxes, still higher j t. .prices, fierce resistance to growing wage increase demands, j j and also a tightening of jobs. ! I ! &lt;3 ! The current up-turn in demands and struggles by | I thousands of Australian workers for various forms of wage ! | . increases should therefore be seen as more than action I | to get back some of what has been taken away in the past I j year by monopoly price jack-ups. j | It is also a timely joining of battle with the employing | j class, who are certainly planning to unload the threatening | I economic "recession' effects. on the workers. | j The waging of even more determined struggle by | I workers everywhere — around the core ACTU 1 965 cam- j I paigns for basic wage and margins increasesj— is becoming S j ah urgent need on behalf of every working family in Aus- J I tralia.
