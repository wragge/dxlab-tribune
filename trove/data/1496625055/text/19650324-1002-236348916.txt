 Delay in || CP USA trial WEW YORK: A ruling by a Wash ington cr .rt has had the effect of postponing till October the ; trial of the U.S. Communist Party | for not registerinc under the Mc- J Carran Act. I The Communist Party has pro- J tested against the 7-months delay 1 which it says is a denial of the con- | stitional right to a speedy trial. 1 The delay, sought by the Ad- 1 nunistration, seems to show that it M is reluctant to come to grips with || the constitutional issues involved j| in the McCarran Act. a Apparently the Department of &lt;M Justice, knowing the law cannot be enforced, still wants to keep it 'f| suspended over people's heads to . g intimidate them and discourage fe| all expressions of dissent. |J
