 Workers condemn B.H.P. ADELAIDE: Three thousand workers at BHP, Whyalla, held a 24-hour strike last week. This was the second such stop- page in support of their claim for a Â£5 a week uniform bonus. At a mass meeting, the workers pro tested against the arrogant attitude of the steel monopoly to recognise and negotiate with officials of the SA Trades and Labor Council and the Combined Union Council of Whyalla. The meeting declared for further stoppages. Amalgamated Engineering, Union Organiser (Mr. J. Shannon) appealed to the men to stand behind the CUC and "bring the BHP to heel." Acting secretary of the TLC (fltr. W. Brown) said he was not known throughout SA as a "particularly mil itant guy", but that Whyalla could develop into the "battleground" where the BHP's refusals to negotiate with organised labor would be broken down. CUC secretary (Mr. M. Brown) said that BHP was maintaining high pro duction through excessive overtime. He condemned the BHP's anti-union attitude.
