Nan Duncan,, three years; I Marlene Dayman, three j years. I This was followed by wide- | spread public discussion and i protest at the severity of the « sentences. I The ASU did not give reasons I for its decision. ! At the N.S.W. Association I meeting last week the majority 1 of over 150 delegates and mem- I bers refused to endorse State ! secretary Roger Pegram's sup- port of the ASU decision. | After other parts of the re- | port had been endorsed, Mr. | Gordon Woods (Balmain) mov- I ed that the NSWSA withhold its ! support for the ASU decision. His motion was seconded by I the Auburn delegate, i Mr. Woods said; that due to ! their actions the prestige of the ! ASU ""is two inches from the | ground". | People who misbehaved should | he dealt with, but the sentence I on Dawn Fraser was particularly 1 bad. ! She had done great work for swimming and had won three j gold medals and must have 2 been very disciplined to have | done so. I She and the other three girls | had been in effect rubbed out I for life. | -If the committee had proved I misconduct (from the managers j report), it might have sufficed | to suspend the girls for the sea- ! son, and that's all. I He added that he could not j accept the report because to do j so would endorse the action of ! the ASU. | Mr. Fegram stated that he I naa wantea to refer the matter - j to the individual states but got f no support from other ASU I Councillors. I ' He wouldn't disclose the con- '$ tents of the Olympic swimming p manager's report as he was |J| "bound to secrecy". The State President (Mr. P. || Q'Toole) said that the delegates , should abide by the decision. / Mr. Woods' resolution had wide support but some delegates were uneasy about a vote of "no confidence in Pegram". Executive supporters spoke f in defence of top officials, but a Christian Brother delegate H "said, "The association is for 0 swimmers not, officials. We must defend swimmers." M Another delegate foreshadow- % ed a resolution calling for a p change in- rules, so that in H future penalised swimmers 1 would have an easy channel of p appeal. . || An amendment was moved Hfl which said that the N.S.W. Sj Association would not accept ft the ASU decision until the j|| facts of the case were sup- pf plied. President O'Toole commented: ' P? "You'll never get them." pi The amendment was finally !'?' carried by 85-45. |.;; Some views of speakers |:| were that the ASU disciplinary action was, "Too severe, tyran- nical and harsh." I One speaker said: "Despite j other strong reports these were |Vi&lt; the only people actually charg- ed following Tokyo. "If the manager was so con- ff| cerned about these things, why ' J was Dawn -Fraser allowed to carry the flag at the end of the Tokyo Games?" A. petition of protest against L" the penalties, signed by ahout 700 residents : and factory work- ers in Balmain (where Dawn pf Fraser began . her swimming | career) was handed in before I the N.S.W. Association's meet- I; ? ing by a woman official of the y-| jDaimam UUD. r It is understood the petition was launched by a 14-year-old schoolgirl. ' I - — — - - — 'E-'.xj
