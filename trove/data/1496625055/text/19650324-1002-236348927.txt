 I B'MAKERS STOP ON WAGES | pERTH: Over 700 boiler- | makers stopped work | last Tuesday afternoon to 2 attend a union meeting i where - they discussed a i campaign for wage in- 1 creases. The stoppage concerned all ; workshops in the metropolitan area. | The meeting carried a resolu- i tion endorsing the campaign in- !" itiated by the Trades and Labor Council for over award payments I to bring wages in W.A. up to the standard in other states. It noted that wages in this state are Â£3 I a week below the Australian aver- | age. I The resolution stated in part: I "... this position can no long- !er be tolerated particularly hav ing regard for the fact that many J of the employers are branches of | companies in the other states and | are engaged in similar and even 1 identical work. I "... Further we resolve that 8s no more than 12 hours overtime | per week will be worked by j | members of this Society until I satisfactory wage levels have ! been established. j | "To this end we request all &lt; i other unions and unionists to I S join forces and unite around this j j campaign and so ensure early j success." I | No order j j Just before the stoppage | j Chief Industrial Commissioner j Schnaars called the union execu- ! j tive in to a conference and warn- j I ed them that they were break- j ing the law. = I He said the meeting should I have been held at the weekend so I as not to disrupt production. g However the union pointed out f that this was the best manner in J which to consult the whole mem- g bership about the important ! issues involved. The Commission- J er did not issue an order against g the stoppage. !
