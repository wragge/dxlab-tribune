 Wharfies in Canberra CANBERRA: About 94 waterside workers from most ports throughout Australia arrived in Canberra yesterday (Tuesday) in support of pensions, a mechanisation fund and a national overseas shipping line. i The cavalcade to Canberra was or ganised by the Federal Council of the Waterside Workers Federation. The waterside workers interviewed repres entatives of all political parties to seek support for these demands. Federation representatives of all states met the ALP Industrial Com mittee. Mr. J. Beitz, federal president of the Federation said after the meet ing that the ALP Committee asked the Federation to produce their evidence in documentary form. Today, Wednesday, the Liberal Party Industrial Committee is to meet with the Federation, which also hopes to meet the Country Party. At a meeting outside Parliament House, Federal organiser of the Fed eration (Mr. M. Wallington) said that the Federation does not want legisla tion on this matter, which &lt;is a matter between the Federation and the ship owners. The ship owners have been forced to agree to pensions in most ports throughout, the world. He told the meeting that at a con ference on Monday in Sydney before Mr. Justice Gallagher the ship owners said as conditions they want the Fed eration to agree to: 1) The Stevedoring authority to have the power to recruit labor; 2) Reintroduce Section 52 of the Stevedoring Act. (This provides for all suspension of appearance money, etc.); D To increase the work force or to reduce it at their discretion and to increase the individual penalty against waterside workers. They said they would not agree to pensions either contributory or non- contributory, not even if the Federa tion agreed to their conditions. Speaking of freight rates Mr. Wal lington said even if the wharfies work ed for nothing it would not make any difference to the freight rates being charged. One year's freight profit could provide a national overseas ship ping line. Â® .
