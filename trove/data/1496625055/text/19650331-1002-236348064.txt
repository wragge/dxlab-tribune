 How about more Aussies, Sir Frank By EILEEN ALLISON [?] IN the past the popularity of the "Tonight" show (Tues day and Thursday at 9.30 pm on Channel 9, Sydney) was due to the personality of Dave Allen. The choice of the new com peres must be questioned. Why was it necessary to import Don Lane, Charlie Brill and Mitzi McCall from America? Their talents are limited. There are many Aus tralians who are far superior both as comperes and entertainers. Channel 9 (owned by the Packer organisation, Consolidated Press) has the mistaken notion that audiences prefer overseas "stars" (most of whom come here with a blownup reputation). This is nonsense. .Last week on the "Tonight" show Rolf Harris appeared as a guest and the verve and vitality of this artist left the Americans for dead. Rolf Harris and many other Aus tralians have been forced to leave their country because of the shock ing attitude of theatrical and TV managements. They have found fame and for tunes abroad. When they come back hem they should be encouraged to stay. Give them a program and forget about the second-raters from America and elsewhere. "IOVE STORY" (Channel v7, Wednesday at 10 pm) is an adult and entertaining program. Do not be fooled by its title as it is ot a slap-up dish of sensa tional n sense. It is series of stories that are concerned with a realistic attitude to human con flicts and emotions. The excellent writing, direction and acting in this British series commends it to all viewers. Last week's episode ("A 7ord m Season") introduced a significant social slant. The hero -ade it very cl. ,r that he wa-r unable to return to his job in Belfast because of redundancy in the shipyards. He was also responsible for making a , couple of English barrowmen aware of the importance of fighting for their rights. The censorship classification dic tates that this show cannot toe seen before 10 pm.
