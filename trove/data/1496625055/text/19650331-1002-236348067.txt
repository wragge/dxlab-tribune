 [?] \Eric Baume and his\ ! Girls are slapped i j A BIG hand to the con- j ductresses AND the I men (drivers and conduct 's ors) of Sydney's Waver ley j bus depot who recently I slapped down a snide at-l I tack on conductresses by j one of the panel on a com- | merciaJ TV show. -g The depot job committee heard I the report that Maggie Tatoberex, | one of the participants on Trie |. Baume's peculiar session on Chan- 1 nel 7, "Beauty and the Beast;" | had heaped scorn on the . dress, I hairdos and appearance of Sydney 1 conductresses. j The committee whipped out a | letter of protest, and about TO of | the girls arid boys who were in | the depot at the time signed it I and sent it off to Baume. The I letter said: — | "At .the commencement of their I daily shift every conductress in this depot, without exception, .re- | ports for work neat and tidy and I . a credit to the Transport Depart- | merit and herself. 1 "However, after only a short | period of pushing their way !' through a crowded bus to collect -f. fares, clothes and hands quickly become soiled and no glamorous S style of hairdo would last long under such working conditions. | 'Regarding the style of our | shoes, which are provided by the 1 girls themselves, only people doing | this hard job would be competent 2 to judge what is suitable footwear. I "We are at a loss to understand | why or for what reason good, 5- honest, hard-working people are attacked in this manner on your I session." | As the committee executive's ac- I companying letter commented: | "The signatories arc only a frac- tion of the 700 depot employees I who would have signed it had they I been available at the time." | t | ""OEACE . . . is the assignment I of the century for each of you, i and if we fail in that assignment', I everything will come to , naught S ... If wc succeed, think how | wonderful the: year 2000 will be." i The man who said this was i President Lyndon Johnson, six 2 months ago. , ' ' ! Today he is gambling with the I year 2000, only 35 years hence, i which many of us will never see | if his dirty gas attacks and his J bombers continue killing men, j -women and children in South' j -Vietnam. ' Id, 'Oh yes, they excuse the gas by 8 saying it's non-lethal. 2 Does that make it any less dirty ! and how do we "know it doesn't j « cause death anyway? i We only have the aggressors' I word for it. | « . j 0 |?kUR cities are changing. Take I ' Sydney for instance. Huge new | blocks of offices, Australia Square, | j the Opera House, grand projects J — but the illusion of progress falls | to bits in suburbs only a few miles f from the G.P.O., where one is confronted with large unsewered j areas. ! This primitive fact is an eye- | I sore, a disgrace and menace to j health. ! # # j T HOPE Channel 9's "On Being j Aa Shiela" (about Australian g '' ' women) to be televised next Sat- . urday will prove to be a more in- j telligent programme than its title | would suggest. . | | rTUIE Australian Gas Light Co. | - now employs women meter j readers for the . first time, and a j jolly good job they are doing, too. - Furthermore, they are receiving | equal pay and there is no ban ! on married women if they want to I train as meter readers. j 4 . !
