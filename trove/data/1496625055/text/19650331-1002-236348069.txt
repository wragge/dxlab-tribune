 W.A. rail crisis By Gordon Murray pERTH: The growing crisis in WA's railway system is highlighted by a recent offer from the Railway Commis- sion or increased wages to juniors and shunters. Shunters are offered increased mar gins ranging from 6/6 to 15/-. Junior workers are offered increases of: — For under 16 years, 15/4; at 16 31/1; . at 17 46/9; at 18 46/9; at 19 31/1; at 20 31/1. The 20-year-olds are brought up to the basic wage. Youths of 19 may be offered jobs as shunters. These offers arose out of the com mission's concern over staff . shortages and not out of demands from the railway union. Apart from the shortages in shunt ing staff, workers report a similar posi tion in Fremantle Goods Sheds and the Midland 'Workshops, where about 100 tradesmen have resigned since Xmas because of low wages. Recently before the Commonwealth Grants Commission, Railway Commis sioner Wayne referred to shortages of Boilermakers, Shunters and Track Workers. He reported that a recruiting Agent in England for the last three months had met only limited success. Grants Commission Chairman Phillips said there would be little more than the weather to attract migrants, as pay and conditions would be no better here, v Shop stewards in Midland Work shops have called for an increase of £4 for all railmen in order to retain workers in the service.
