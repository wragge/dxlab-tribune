 Thoughtful, balanced I MOST HEARTILY agree with Stan I Tapper's comments, they arc bal anced, thoughtful and right to the important points. Gold medals mean nothing unless the winner fcontributes something to create a better society, a higher stan dard of morals, loyalty to their country, to their sponsors, to you and me who helped pay for the journey. Our lovely country reeks with juve nile crime and delinquency, following the American pattern of disdain for authority and decency. To excuse every , high ranking sport for his or. her delinquency - is a disservice to that person and a terribly bad example to our. receptive youth. We are not progressing "spiritually" but are rapidly following the shallow veneer of American "right and justice", to their dishonour. And, in saying this, it is not a condemnation of the Ameri can people as people, for I have yet to find bigger hearled and more liberal people than the average American citi zen. Russia today is the second most powerful nation in the world, and it is so because of discipline, loyalty, and the brotherhood of man. That it has made its mistakes, neither it or anyone will deny, but the principle has pre vailed. The same can be said of China, where discipline and loyalty and human rights are rapidly developing a truly human society and a power that when awakened will shake the world. Such thoughtful and balanced letters as StairTapper's are at least an inspira tion and an example. F.O. (St. Ives).
