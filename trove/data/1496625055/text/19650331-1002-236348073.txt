 CROWN LAND SALES ABOLISHED ADELAIDE: The SA Labor Government has decided to abolish the sale of Crown lands and to lease them only. The Minister of Lands (Mr. By- waters) commented: "Instead of an aggregation ot lands by big landowners, the Governments' move would help young people to settle on the land. At present these young people found it impossible to get the land because of high costs." Mr. Bywaters saicr that perpetual lease was regarded as indefinite and those affected would have virtually all the rights of freehold. The continuing lease would provide no barrier to people improving their properties. Already this move has caused con sternation amongst the wealthy sec tions of the community and . their Liberal Party spokesman. Chairman of the Parliamentary Lib eral Party, Mr. Nankivell, MP) com- plained that â€” "big pastoral companies will be prevented from transferring their interests to SA." He continued: "One recent pastoral company to come here was Australian Scottish, which took up big parcels of land in the Keith area. "The company had to get freehold titles before it committed itself. This kind of company farms on a big busi ness scale ..." The former Lands Minister in the Playford administration (Mr. Quirke) had added his protest at Labors new measure. Such protests by the representatives of big business interests, indicate the worth of the new decision by the Walsh Government.
