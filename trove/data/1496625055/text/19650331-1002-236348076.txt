 - - - 1 Jak Ruby may escape JACK RUBY, murderer of Lee Harvey Oswald, may go scot free for his crime, says the New York correspondent of the Soviet TASS news agency. Ruby killed Oswald, who had been arrested for the murder of President Kennedy, after being al lowed by the Dallas police into the police station. It has been alleged - that Ruby aimed to silence Oswald before he could either defend himself or give information about the Rightwing interests widely believed to have plotted Kennedy's murder. Suspicions were also voiced tjhat Ruby had been promised immunity if he succeeded in silencing Os wald. TASS' New _ York correspondent says that, a year after Ruby's being sentenced , to death for the murder of Oswald, it seems that Ruby may escape death altogether. American legal specialists say that even if all appeals available to Oswald leave the sentence in force, it will still be two years before Ruby could be executed. But now his lawyers have won the right to a new trial in which the court is to decide whether Ruby really went insane after the killing of Oswald, as his defence counsel .maintains. The first hearing of this trial will be held on March 29. At the main trial -the court re jected the defence claim that Ruby was "temporarily insane" when he killed Oswald. But the court can now find that Ruby went insane after the sen tence of death was passed on him. If so, he will be sent to an asylum. So. far Ruby has been enjoying every comfort.
