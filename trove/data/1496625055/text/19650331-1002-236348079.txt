 Lee Kuan Yew's amasina frankness CINGAPORE Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew came to Australia to boost Malaysia, but his admissions while here have helped to reveal its true nature. In an interview with the Sunday Telegraph last Sunday he admitted that the Malaysian Government (now bol stered by Australian troops) holds power because of a jerrymandered electoriate. He pointed out that Malaysian pre mier Rahman "gave 40 seats in the Government of Malaysia to 1.2 million people in Borneo and only 15 seats to 1.8 million Chinese in Singapore." Rahman, said Lee, had brought the Bornese in and given them inflated rep- resentation, because "he thought they were all Malays, like him . . He made a simple, stupid, naive mistake . . . No wonder there's trouble in Sabah. and Sarawak . . . the Tunku was a fool." Yet Lee still expects Australia to bolster the "fool" in his folly and send troops to stop the inevitable "trouble" in Sarawak and Sabah! Lee also admitted the racial cleavage between Malays and Chinese that is already tearing Malaysia to pieces, quite apart from anything Indonesia may do. Asked whether there could be real trouble ahead between Chinese and Malays, even to the extent of a Viet nam-type civil war, he agreed that "It's possible . . . the possibility concerns me."
