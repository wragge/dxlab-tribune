 NEW S.A. LABOR GOVT STARTS WORK CAR OWNERS' STAKE IN INSURANCE PUN ADiLABDE: The s freep increase in third party insurance pre miums should result in motorists giving the strongest support to the Labor Government's State insurance proposal. JABOR'S plan covers third party insurance. The increases, are not justified in view of the powerful financial posi tion of the insurance companies. The excuse of increased damage paid by the companies for injury and death is flimsy. The increase were recommended by the Premiums Committee. This committee is under the chair manship of Sir Edgar Bean, a former parliamentary draughtsman, while another member was the public ac tuary, both civil servants under the former Playford Government adminis tration. Two other members are" appointed by the insurance companies and two more represent motorists, one from the Royal Automobile Association and the other representing commercial vehicles. The four representatives mentioned had to be approved of by the recent Treasurer, Sir Thomas Playford. The Committee can only deal with figures provided by the insurance companies and can only reach con clusions based upon those figures. With this kind of set up on the committee and the fact that insurance companies could hardly be described as being on the breadline, one would share the feelings of the Labor Premier Frank Walsh who said he was "mos'; surprised" at such increases in premiums. Only shortly before the announce ment of the increase by Sir Edgar Eean, the Labor Government had an- nour i its State Insurance plan. Mr. Walsh, commenting on the in creases in premiums said "These in- , creases further justify the considera tion that will be given by the Govern ment to the establishment of a State insurance office. Then we will ascert ain whether such steep increases are warranted." In the circumstances, the interests of motorists would be served also by the abolition of the present Premiums Committee.
