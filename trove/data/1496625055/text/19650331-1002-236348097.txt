"In coming to our country from diff erent horizons, representing wide sect ors of youth, you will certainly get to know us and we shall also have the chance to get to know you. "And together, beyond all the differ ences, around the themes of solidarity, peace and friendship — for these are the three main ideas of the 9th Festi val — we shall strive for the cause of drawing all people closer together, we shall contribute, modestly, but with all the passion and conviction that Algeria puts into all its enterprises, to the strengthening of the international community. "We shall spare no effort to ensure that the 9th Festival will have the dimensions that we, together with the entire young generation, hope for: A world rid forever of war, hatred and oppression in all its forms. "Wc shall spare no effort to this end. "We shall do everything we can to help towards the success of the Festival. That is what our people have under- , taken to do, and in the first place our youth, who are particularly interested and then our Government."
