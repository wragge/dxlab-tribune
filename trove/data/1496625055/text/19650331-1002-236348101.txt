 m _ , j I When they line up j i at the barrier | | By "The Challenger" j | Every year almost all Australians have an interest j ! in the Melbourne Cup, and for that particular day everyone j i is interested to know whether or not his or her "plunge" 1 j will come off. Whichever way it goes, it usually doesn't j I much affect the workers' future. | e | "FHERE is, however, one I race coming off in I May that can have a far- reaching effect on every | Australian worker, and it j is for the workers' benefit j that the following form | guide has been lifted from | a recent bulletin. j The election j stakes ! As the horses parade before j the stand of public opinion prior j to taking their places at the bar- ! rier for the running of the 1965 j N.S.W. Election Stakes, we have j a chance to review the form of I the runners and riders. ? The field today, Ladies and j Gentlemen, is a small one of j only four runners with a few | emergencies. Carrying top weight I is "Decadence" the Liberal Party I nag ridden by ASkin, that tired | old jockey; though he has a lot I of experience in this type of race, j he still has to show that he has | the ability to steer his mount i home. In training for this event j it is well for punters to remem- 1 ber that in order to bring this ! horse here today its owners have j felt it necessary to have it put | through its paces by that well known Canberra rider Menzies; ! but it will take more than such I riders to make this old horse j successful! j Its stable mate, also in the ! I field today, is the D.L.P. owned I 'Monopoly's Friend', by 'Disrup- j tion' out of "Splitting Tactics", f i These two have been running to- j ! gether for a long time, their j I monopoly owners are used to j j running through mud and in the I faces of all other contestants that I dare to oppose them, and the I same type of thing is expected | in this race. j Here comes the A.L.P. mount ! 'Midway'; punters will remember j I that though this horse has been j f the winner for the last 25 years | j and on form should win today by j f a handsome margin, it does not j i have the requirements of a true 2 I champion of the people's needs, J f but does go some way towards j | making the punter's life an easier j I one. ! Also taking its place is the j | Communist Party's entrant "For I | Peace and Socialism"; this is i | well worthy of an each way bet, | 1 giving second place to the A.L.P. j | mount. Though this horse has j J not had an electoral success it j deserves it; it has always been a ! steady fighter for higher living j standards and democratic rights, j in the face pf stiff opposition j from the monopoly stable. I Now as the entrants approach ! j ine carrier, our tip is, give your | j vote to the Communist Party, j i with second preference to the = « !. A.L.P.— and put the Liberals last! I 1 I f I I The recent move by the Inter- I 1 j national Rugby Board to compel j i | the withdrawal of the Australian j \ | Wallabies' proposal to play .in J | j Rumania next year, is a setback j | ' to the development of Rugby j -j : Union. ; I I | I j It is also, unfortunately, a j J : "sporting" contribution to tbe j | | continuation of the cold war j | j atmosphere between the capital- j | ; ist and socialist worlds. | 1 I | j The history of censorship ana | j| cock-eyed ruling of the Inter- j | i national Rugby Board is not con- | | j fined to this present action. In j j 1961 the South Africans planned j g | to play in Italy on their way | | j home, but .were refused permis- j | j sion. j j Also, a 1958 ruling provides j j that only France can play full . | international matches against | j member countries and it is this | | ruling that has barred Australia » | from playing against Rumania. I | Most people would agree that , I the cultural and sporting fields | I should be used in the world to- j j day, to bring people closer to- ? | gether. And it is .hoped, that the I j delegates of the International j j Rugby Union Board will soon do j ! something to alter the present j j set-up, so as to reorganise tne | j board to function along lines tnat ! are truly in the interest of the j sport and humanity. It is grit.- j fying to know, that the Austra- ! lian delegate, Mr. Charles Blunt s j | thoughts on the matter, have thi- J j end in view. |
