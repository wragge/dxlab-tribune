 - m « « Boost the Fund for May Day! [?] fund target £1.500 By June Mills , |N five weeks Australian workers will be celebrating May Day, the day of working class solidarity throughout the world. This year workers who are ap palled at" the bombing and gas at tacks against the people of Vietnam will be taking part in the May Day marches not only for their own de mands for improved wages and con ditions but to bring pressure on the United States and Australian Gov ernments for a peaceful settlement in Vietnam. Right from the very outset Tri bune has called for an end to the US attacks and intervention. It has always raised the demand that the people of Vietnam and other Asian countries should be al lowed to manage their own affairs without outside interference. This is one reason why I'm mak ing a special appeal for May Day donations to Tribune Fund. A ready response to this appeal should help us reach our target of £1500 by June 30. Thirteen weeks remain and to succeed we need to average £40 weekly. Don't wait un til May 1 to send in those donations, do it right away. This week donations: L.
