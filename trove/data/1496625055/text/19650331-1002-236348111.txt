 Isa resyanption onus rests with management |l From PETE THOMAS, just back from Mt. Isa. r BRISBANE: The onus for what happens now in the Song and biffer Mt. Isa dispute rests obviously on the Mt. Isa Mines mono poly, which is being called on to give a guarantee against any use of the stab-in-the-back weapon of .victimisation. " IF Mt. Isa Mines gives an un dertaking against victimisa tion, then this would elevate prospects of an early general resumption. Australia-wide attention is sharply focussed on what attitude Mt. Isa Mines adopts when the issue comes before the conference of parties which is to begin in Brisbane today (Wednesday), with Industrial Com missioner Harvey presiding. Following the announcement that Wednesday's conference was being called the Queensland Trades and Labor Council deferred its 24-hour State- wide stoppage. Mr. J. McMahon (Mt. Isa Trades and Labor Council president) said: "The onus is on the "company to make some genuine move towards a proper settlement." Mr. Bevan Foot (Mt. Isa Trades and Labor Council secretary) said that the unions all along had shown a readiness to negotiate for; a settle ment; "it is for the company now to do the same." No union worth its "salt should stand for any victimisation, he said. : "Whatever the. outcome of the dis pute may eventually he, the Mt. Isa workers will never forget those who have supported us," Mr. Foot said. He added that the money had been put to the best use. There would be a complete audit of all moneys at the conclusion. This would be made available to all those entitled to it. Mr. Fat Mackie said: "We in Mt. Isa are overwhelmed by the sup port of the trade union movement in this struggle. He said that his own position in the dispute had never been one of just an individual. "I've always been trying to show that I'll do whatever the workers want me to do and whatever is best for the working class," he said.
