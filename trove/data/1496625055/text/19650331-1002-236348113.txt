 French Communists gain more votes pARIS: The municipal elections have been a big success for the French Communist Party and the democratic forces that stood to- gether on a single ticket, says a CP statement. In Le Havre, Nimes, Colombes, democratic forces gained a victory in six districts. In Le Harve, Nimes, Colombes, Levallois-Porret and other big towns Communists became mayors. All Seine (Paris) municipal councils headed by Communists were re-elected. New municipalities have been won in the provinces. Contrary to the Gaullist Govern ment's hopes, the municipal elections assumed a big political importance, the statement adds. It has been proved that the workers and democratic forces, if united, can defeat the Gaullists and other reac tionary forces. TASS (Soviet newsagency) notes In terior Minister Frey's announcement that 34 French cities of over 30,000 people now have Communist mayors, nine more than six years ago. The greatest number of any one party. The number of Gaullist mayors increased by one. The number of socialist mayors dropped from 41 to 32. The Gaullists failed in a drive to capture Paris. They also lost in Grenoble and (crushingly) in Lyons. Communist Party general secretary Waldeck Rochet said the Party, draw ing on the support of millions of people, would continue its efforts to rally the democratic and working clasess against the regime of reaction and personal power and for the estab lishment of a new democratic system that would pursue a real policy of progress and peace.
