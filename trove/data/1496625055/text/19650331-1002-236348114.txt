 WA workers prevent Govt sellout pERTH: A firm stand by State Engineering Works em ployees and a ban by the WA Trades and Labor Council on the dismantling of SEW forg ing equipment has forced an agreement on the future of this Government-owned enterprise. Two fitters were sacked last week for refusing to remove the bolts on the forging equipment, which the Brand Liberal Government has sold for a song to the new firm of Don- caster Hadfields. This was followed by a works stoppage and a decision to uphold the ban. The following day no further fit ters were ordered to dismantle the equipment. In subsequent negotia tions the TLC, on behalf of the unions involved, gained an under taking from the Government to: Reinstate the two fitters; ® remove the steam hammer by private contractor; ® guarantee- continued employ ment for the three blacksmiths dis placed; spend £-115,000 on the works, sell no more machinery. These terms have been endorsed by a masjs meeting at the works. The 40-year-old forging equipment will only operate in steam. Many private firms in Fremantle have opposed its sale as it has ful filled orders for them for many years. It is obvious that Doncaster Had fields will Instal modern electric forges and leave the SEW forge idle. This British dominated firm has its eye on contracts for the stand ard gauge railway, and wants to be able to make its own price without competition from any other source.
