 ! New pipeline: I | Off Co. | I leaves j 1 havoc | I trail 1 I I j DELAIDE : Broken) | sewer, gas and water I I pipes, torn up trees and ) | dust — j This is the picture described by | I Brighton and Somerton residents | | as the 20-mile pipeline from Port | | Stanvac to Birkenhead is being g I laid through this residential area. 1 jj As the Brighton Town Clerk $ | (Mr. J. Chaston) said, there is no i = redress to the oil company be- 1 I cause the pipeline is sanctioned fj I by an Act of Parliament. j g The Oil Refinery Indenture Act ? | 1958 ratifies an agreement be- I J tween the SA Government and j | tlie Standard — Vacuum Refin- g I cry Company (Australia) Proprie- | | tary Limited in connection with j | the working of an oil refinery. | S The Act stipulates that the I | Company can lay a pipeline in jj | accordance with plans and speci- i = fications which the Minister of = I Roads "shall not unreasonably I | refuse to approve." ft ; Councils have no real say. They | ! are merely consulted by the Min- i | ister of Roads, whose hands are S | tied anyway. Councils receive no | I remuneration as a result of the g I pipeline going through its area. = ! So the Company just goes its | j merry way and residents can suf- I I fer but have no comeback at all, g S according to the law of the land. | | Inquiries have indicated that | | since the Act was passed under g g the Playford Government, the | 1 Standard Vacuum Refining Com- | | pany has now become two com- g g panies — the Mobil Oil Australia I B Limited and the Petroleum Refin- I | ing Australia Proprietary Limit- I g ed. In the latter Mobil has a 74 S 9 per cent interest and ESSO a 26 j | per cent interest. j
