 Perth Mayor won't repent PERTH. — Lord Mayor Veryard is unrepentant for his refusal to officiate at a civic reception to Itido- ncsinn Christian leaders, despite au Australia-wide spate of criticism. Navy Minister Ch'aney, the World Council of Churches, the United Nations Association, the Australia- Asian Association and the Christian Youth Council were > among those who criticised his decision. The State executive of the A.L.P. sent an immediate protest to Mr. Veryard over his refusal to attend the reception. The outstanding fact in the dispute is that while the Australian people, under the Menzies Government, are not consulted on the question of committing Australia to aggressive adventures, any Tom, Dick — or Harry — can declare that we are in a state of war with countries such as Indonesia, with whom we still have diplomatic relations.
