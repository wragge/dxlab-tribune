 Wonderful place for millionaires |N 1952, the year Dalray wor the Melbourne Cud. I pro- mised myself a trip to Cairns. Well, here I am at last, in the tourists paradise.. Being a pen sioner, I find Cairns to be a very expensive place in which to live. It is undoubtedly a well-planned, beautiful town with friendly people. My first eye-opener was that taxis have no meters. The trip from town to Edgehill cost me 10/- — a distance of 31 miles. The driver told me he had to charge for the return trip unless he could get a fare back. "But", he said, "I have as much chance of that as I would trying to borrow the 'Thistle' from Uncle Bob." Then, of course, when in town 1 chnnot possibly pass all the hotels, so I have a few beers, and is beer dear? A seven-oz. glass costs 1 /Id, a bottle of "Gold Top" ale 4/-. while rum is l/5d per nip,-. Meals in a cafe are highly priced. Eggs on toast 6"/6d (the same meal in Brisbane 3/6d) and a good feed knocks one back 9/-. Tf you are not a reckless spender you may share a room for only £1, with tea and toast for breakfast. Should you be well lined, a room may be had for £6 nightly. This. of . course, is for wealthy tourists. And naturally, being able to read. I purchase the ftondav Truth for a mere 1 /3d Taking the, good with the bad, pen sioners — the thrifty mob — may get a single room for £2/10/- weekly. As I said, this is a nice town and, as my mate said: "Yair. Everything; in Cairns is above board and fair. A wonderful place for a millionaire." FRED MARTIN, Cairns.
