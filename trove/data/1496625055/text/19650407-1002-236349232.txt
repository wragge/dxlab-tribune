 Cry of a Vietnamese Â» mother (By Sandra, a Sydney girl in her early teens). They killed my husband and my children too, They burnt them to death and the youngest was two, xlie Domuing is cnuiess it cumco day after day, This maybe our country but we have no say. What kind of men are these who make war on children, Are they cowards or are they men, Their planes are like the deafening thunder We plant our crops so we may eat, But all this they put asunder. The bombing is endless and we have no sleep, They bomb our schools while our children are taught, If they are not killed they are left distraught. VFho will put a stop to this war, Before -it destroys us all, Our life is worth nothing To those who give the orders and press the buttons. This is the slaughter of the inno cents all over again, When they kill my people do they have no shame We are like a growing tree To live we m-.st be free.
