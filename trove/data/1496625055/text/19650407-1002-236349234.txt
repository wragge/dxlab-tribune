 [?] I A cry for the children j from an American- i Australian mother As the formerly American mother of a child who fell ofF a train at Chafrswood Station, 1 should II ke to express my deep gratitude to i ail those good people who helped. I THE N.S.W. police, who were I 1 most considerate; the statt 1 of the Royal North Shore Hos- | pital, who were so reassuring I to a frightened little boy, and ai all tn that wonderful | Australian hero, who when he j saw the boy fall, grasped him 1 and help him up between the f train and the platform until the train could be stopped. 1 There is no doubt that his. quick 31 thinking and action saved- my son's 4 life, and I wish I knew words J strong enough to express a mother s thanks. S After this close brush with death, i weep for the mothers of Vietnam, whose children are being burned | and blown to bits by American bombs, J I implore my adopted country- j men: be as great nationally as you J are individually. l| Compel your government to use J its good offices as mediator to end I the slaughter in Vietnam now.
