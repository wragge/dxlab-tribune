 I Eolkies in 1 Mt. Isa 1 y E "pOLK-SIN GERS Don Henderson 8 1 and Geoff Wills, up from Bris- M bane, have made a tremendous hit in &S Mt Isa. with' their sones â€” some of 1| them with up-to-the-minute topical || allusions to the Mt. Isa struggle. jfi Their first performance, within 1 hours of their early-morning arrival ijfi from Brisbane, was at a meetmg. M of the Disputes Committee." Wt They got a great hand, ||| That night, they performed to a highly-enthusiastic audience ' at the III weekly Women's Auxiliary meeting. Si So keen were the women that ||| they set about arranging a function ::||| at the week-end at which Don Hen- ili derson and Geoff Wills were to per- 81 form. jj|| On the Saturday night, the sing- ||| ers were a star turn at an Irish !lS Club social. ||| And a highlight of the /week-eiid III was a Star Theatre concert, includ- jgl tog Don Henderson and Geoff II Wills and local performers. The Henderson-Wills repertoire III grew during their stay, as . they ||1 learnt about local happenings and turned these into sly verses which delighted the audiences. H Altogether, the singers were a III tremendous success, and you can ex- |! pect to hear their songs being sung II to Mt. Isa for a long time ahead, gj P.T. (Mt. Isa).
