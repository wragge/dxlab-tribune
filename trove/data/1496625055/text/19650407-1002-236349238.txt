 Impressed I with Socialism ! From ALF WATT j LAOSCOW : Richard i Scott, assistant Fed- j eral secretary of the Boil- ermakers' Society, gave ime his impressions after spending six weeks in socialist countries. He attended a shipbuilding uni on conference in Poland and also visited the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union. Trade unions played a very im portant" role in the management I of industry as well as promoting I the welfare of members, he said. I Their activities covered a far ! wider field than at home. He was impressed with responsibilities I of union factory committees and I also with the way union organ- | isations works from the bottom I upwards as well as from the top L downwards. j The tempo of work in factories j appears to be slower than in I Australia, with a noticeable ab- I sence of rush and bustle. He j found factories to be clean, with I pathways clear and free of rub- j bish. j Mixing freely with workers at | work and in Palaces of Culture, I he found them to be happy in 1 their way of life. I The facilities provided by free I medical sendee were astounding, j So also was the educational sys- I tem and opportunities given to I all to improve their general j knowledge and their skills. j Another aspect that impressed I .him was the Palaces of Culture ! where workers were taught ant" j enjoyed many kinds of amateur Lart. Performances he attended | were of an exceptionally high j standard. I Summing up he said he was j most impressed with the social j system in all the socialist coun- I tries he visited. I Dick Scott
