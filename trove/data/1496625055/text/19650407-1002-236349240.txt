 OVER TO YOU, MR. RENSHAW ! CYDNEY: The NSW Labor Council decided re cently to ask the Premier, Mr. Renshaw, to include in his policy speech agreement to grant long service leave to building workers. The building unions have been campaigning for such a scheme since 1958. At a recent conference between the unions and the master builders, the employers" said they agreed in principle with the proposals submit ted by the unions. The NSW Minister for Labor, Mr. Maloney, has on numerous occasions told the unions that such a scheme was "too difficult" to organise, even though the unions had submitted what they believed to be a work able scheme. A meeting of the Building Trades Group of unions last week called for the inclusion of this demand in the Premier's policy speech. , . It was also decided to send a copy of the unions' proposals on such a scheme to all State MLAs. All the building unions have been asked to make personal approaches to MLAs and MLCs.
