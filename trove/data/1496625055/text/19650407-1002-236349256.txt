Only a frac tion of what is published in Eur- ; ope and Asia gets translated into j English. i Recent issues of "Marxist Re- j view" have contained over and j above much excellent directly ! political material, stimulating j articles by Ernst Fischer, (auth- j or of the now famous "The ne- ! cessity of Art"), Jack Lindsay, | Honor Arundel, David Craig and j others. | ... | "THAT great Communist 1 mural painter Siqueiros ! has caused a new stir in j Mexico with his show of | powerful small easel pic- | tures painted in his single | windowed, 13ft by 6ft cell I during . his four-year im- l prisonment. | | Critics noted that the dynamic J 1 figure studies, flower pieces and ! I landscapes, as well as some near | abstracts, were more subtle and | S complex in colour than in hi ? | murals. S I Immediately after the pressure J I of world opinion forced his re- | J lease last year he held a meet- t ! ing in front of his huge unfinish- | | ed revolutionary mural in the | I Historical Museum at Chapulte- j S pec, which he'd been working on = I when arrested, and restated his I | views on art and life. j | Aged sixty eight, Siqueiros, one | s of this century's most vital, con- j = troversial and colorful artistic = | figures, has four murals in pub- I | lie buildings to complete, in j ® Havana and New Delhi as well g I as in his native Mexico. ! j g T OVERS of Tom Roberts' j j "Shearing of the rams" in g' I the Victorian National Gallery ! j ! will be delighted with its refresh- ! ed appearance now that its sag- ) ging canvas has been cleaned up I and carefully stretched on board 1 by Gallery restorer Harley Grif- I fiths. It looks really fine and its I life has been lengthened. | | It is also good to see that this, | State Gallery has resumed its | "Survey" exhibitions, featuring ! trends in contemporary local art. j The first this year presents the $ figurative work, stopping just g this side of abstraction, of ! French, Kemp, Senbergs, Craw- | ford and Johnston. j It was a disturbing and mov- | ing experience to watch the res- | ponse to this work of a dozen ! deaf mutes from the Lady Her- | ring Spastic Centre. | Their interest was intense. | A show of hands indicated that I the majority liked best the pic- | tures with bright, happy colors, | some of the Crawfords, rather 1 than the better-known symbolism. | of French or Kemp's more mys- 2 tical visions. |
