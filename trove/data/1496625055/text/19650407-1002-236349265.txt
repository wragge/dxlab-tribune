 "LIFE WAS DESPERATE" How it began It is claimed by the Americans that the guerillas' inspiration and technical know-how comes from the North. I FOUND that while the rank and file had graduated from local self-defence units, com- manders had graduated as lead ers in the earlier war against the French and in the present fight ing against the U.S. and puppet troops. v The Mekong Delta, especially the provinces of My Tho and Ben Tre, are the most revoluntionary areas in all of Vietnam, North or South. It was there that in November, 1940, the first major revolt against the French was launched . . . against conscription and unbearable taxes. The first resistance war against ffj the French also started in the |f Mekong Delta iii September, 1945, | a full year before it started in the fl North. ; ' 1 And the first armed action against M the Diem regime also spread to the || Delta after Diem's crushing of the M armed religious sects in 1955. If As for the technical know-how, the Delta peasants have waged al- most continuous warfare for nearly -| a quartter of a century. _ % Less than 12 miles from Saigon, 'i I was speaking to a district leader | of the military arm of the South 4 Vietnam National Front of Libera- J tion. || By early 1960, he said, "Life had j Become so .desperate, tne oppres- m sion was so ferocious, with arrests, m torture, executions a daily ;cur- i rence in our district, that people J| were ready to move. i "The policy up till the end of |j 1959 had been exclusively a legal, || political, non-violent form of strug- i gle, but faced with the wholesale | wiping out of all former resistance I cadres, it changed at the end of | 1959, to permit the use of arms J but in self-defence only." | "We decided that even for self- | defence we had to have weapons." I In February, 1960, they decided gi to attack a French-built fortress mm at Tua Hai, 55 miles N.W. of Sai- j ffl gon, with the aim of capturing l| 300 weapons and ammunition. f| Home-made mines were laid ill and exploded and 200 guerillas j|| poured over the ramparts, and 111 overwhelmed or drove out the Iji garrison. - |» "The maximum we could carry, ||J even with some of the enemy sol- II diers who had come over to us and 11 offered to help, were about 1,000 ||| arms, including 800 rifles and a ||| good selection of automatic wea- ||| pons. rm "The 500 porters had turned up ||j safely and within 'an hour and forty- H five minutes of the attack, our ||| convoy was moving' back into the g| jungle again, everyone doubled |j under the weight of weapons and g| ammunition. ||| "We kept enough arms for the ||| battalion we set up immediately ||g as a result of the battle, others ||| were distributed to all other H provinces, where they were most ||| needed. j» Among the weapons sized were | 81 mm. and 6 mm. mortars — | A completely new stage in the | struggle was ushered in. 1
