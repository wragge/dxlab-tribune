 [?] a straight bat? | By THE CHALLENGER ;f 'M With the winding up of the second Test last Friday, the Australian team could he said to be a little the worse for wear both physically and morally. On the physical side, a num ber of Australian players were injured, Bob Cowper, Peter Philpott and Graham Thomas, with a badly bruised leg, being the main victims. The slow state of the pitch is conceded to have been the main factor at tributing to these accidents. The West Indies' captain Garfield Sobers is reported to have said that possibly too many bumpers were bowled, but pointed out that bowl ers such as Hall and Griffith, be cause of their speed, have trouble with- a pitch as slow as that used for the second Test. - The test publicity kicked off with exclamations of what was described as "Simpson's blunder, etc.", and finished on a vein of "dismal test fizzling to a draw, etc.". Critics, experts or whatever else we may like to call them in the majority of cases tend to take too much for granted, with the result that even those, who have been ex- players can be wrong in their asser tions. It seems too, that accusations of "chucking" are always made by the losing side and how is it that those found "guilty" by the critics are never accused until they reach test cricket standard. / Surely Charlie Griffiths and others who have been branded "chuckers" must have "chucked" just as hard in matches other than tests. Where were the "experts" then? Under the circumstances, it is a good thing to get the pc/nt of view of the players themselves. : Australian captain Bob Simpsori, has defended his action of sending the West Indies into hat first by saying that it it could have paid off , had catches been taken. Also, by topping the West Indies score, the Australians proved, that they didn't lose anything by batting second. It is plain to see that these facta '-:i speak for themselves. 'Jf And it is well for any potential! critic to remember that the outcome of the game, contest or bout is to a SI great extent dependent on the ability Nl of the opposition. If we keep this in mind, we may " if in the future we find ourselves ' - sitting in the bleachers at the fights, next to some vociferous "critic" screaming out, "Hit 'im ya mug, ill while ya got the wind with ya" poli- |1 tely ask him has he ever demo- 1 strated his advice in practice. iff I Rugby League From Jim Sharrock m pi The pre-season competition over $| with St. George running out easy || winners. Saturday, April 3, opened the 1965 || premiership competition, with the |1 match of the- day at the Sydney |f Cricket Ground between St. George 8 and Western Suburbs. g£ H These two teams had met the pre- vious Sunday in the final of the || pre-season competition and St. George were easy winners. || This may have accounted for only || 17,000 odd being at the Cricket ' Ground on Saturday. Most people || forecast a runaway win for St. George, but such was not the case. Honours went to Wests in the first |l half and to St. George in the second 1 half. _' Ni Wests showed a remarkable im- efj provement in their previous Sunday's 'ff- match and had Bray had a bit more luck in kicking they could have run out the winners, but you can't take it || from the Saints, they came hack in the second half, being down nine nil in the first half, with some really || beautiful moves, which left Wests no chance. : n Towards the finish Wests were a |g very tired team; t'.e energy they had g| expended in the first half began to m tell. f Saints three tries to one showed 11 their superiority. '1 Looking for outstanding players 4 was difficult,, but my eye caught No. II 10, John Hayes for Wests, and no M dotibt Ian Walsh's hooking for m Saints in -the second half was very || decisive. M If we are to look for a weakness || in St. George this season then it 11 would be in their Reserve Grade. || Compared with their form at this || period last season it would be well m down. II Some comments on those views m held by a lot of people who believe m that it would be. a better competl- || tion if Saints did not stand out so M much: 1 I cannot agree with- this viewpoint Jg it would lower the standard 01 | League. H Other teams have to endevour to ffl raise their standard' up to the Saints m and why not? ' M They all have good material. J I believe it will be a stand up f| on the "hill" next time Saints an || Wests meet. ; r": — — I "1 S
