 Printers' strike gYDNEY : Government printers, who 'are among the lowest paid in the industry in NSW, have been on strike since last Friday for wage increases, rejected a recommenda tion to return to work at a meet ing on Tuesday until some offer was made on their demands. State Conciliation Commissioner Mr. G. Herron issued orders against the printers that they return to work. The strike, which involves over 800 workers, began at the Government Printing Office and spread to the Department of Lands last Sunday. Mr. Herron made his return to work order so that negotiations could take place, but negotiations without result have been going' on for over 12 months. The printers are demanding £2/11/- a week- increase - which would bring a tradesman's rate - to £25 a week. Many' printers" outside the State Government Departments . average from £28 ' to £30 a week. ='- -
