 Tradesmen pack court to back up apprentices . SYDNEY: About 100 tradesmen and ironworkers packed the corridors of the Apprenticeship Commissioner's offices in Sydney last week (picture above) in support of 19 appren tices who were cited for a "breach of contract" by Australian Iron and Steel. 'THE 19 lads (apprentice boiler- malcers) were cited for stopping work with the men in support of a wage demand. They were suspended for the day and the Commissioner ruled that they would lose wages for the period they were on 'strike. All tradesmen and ironworkers stop ped work last Wednesday as a pro test against the company's action and to give the apprentices moral sup port at the hearing. Last Wednesday's stoppage involved about 140 boilermakers, cranedrivers, electricians and ironworkers. Background Background to the dispute was the company's refusal to allow union of ficials to take part in negotiations over bonus payments. This refusal led to a protest stop page in which the apprentices parti cipated. The workers want all bonus pay ments incorporated in their award. The apprentices also have a long standing resentment of a gratuity pay ment. The Sydney Branch of the Boiler makers' Society threatened a Sydney- wide stoppage of boilermakers in the event of these apprentices having their indentures cancelled. At last Wednesday's hearing an in dustrial officer for the Broken Hill Co. Pty. Ltd. said the boys' action was a breach of contract and that disciplin ary action should be taken. Mr. J. Sponberg (assistant secretary of the Boilermakers Society) said that apprenticeship contracts which re quires lads to "obey all demands of the master are outmoded relics of the last century." Relic of past "In those days the teaching of a trade was a personalised affair where the lad renounced all ordinary rights. He was not permitted to marry with out the employer's consent." "These relics handed down no longer cover industrial production to day," Mr. Sponberg said.
