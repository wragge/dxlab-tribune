 [?] SYDNEY: "We Want More Pay!" shouted 300 waterside work ers outside the Commonweaith Arbitration Commission yesterday (Tuesday) in Sydney. UUKNINb smoko meetings held yesterday throughout the Sydney waterfront decided to stop work for the day in protest against the employers single wage proposals and in support of the unions' basic wage claim. The Commission resumed its hear- . ing yesterday of the unions' claim for increases in the federal basic wage from 9/- to 13/- depending on the State. The amount claimed in NSW is 10/-. This claim will only compensate the workers for the eroding of their wages through price increases since the Commission granted the Â£1 increase last year. Employers are again pressing their plan for a "total wage" which was rejected by the Commission last year. The appearance of the . Waterside workers outside the Court upset the "quiet, dignified atmosphere" sur rounding the hearings. .Coming in loud and clear, through the windows was the simple but direct argument from 500 wharfies. Australian Council of Trade Unions' advocate, Mr. R. Hawke told the Commission last week that the un ions' claim was "very modest." But evidently not "too modest" for the Federal Government to consider it to be "fraught with great danger to the economy," and for. the employ ers to oppose it in their usual way. Union leaders and advocates have said on many occasions that little or nothing will be given by the court unless the workers demonstrate their support. This the Sydney waterside workers did yesterday until the police moved them on for "obstructing the traffic."
