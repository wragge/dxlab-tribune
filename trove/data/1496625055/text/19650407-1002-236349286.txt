More are j expected to leave. j j This is the prospect that faces j j ! small farmers and sharefarmers j j right throughout the Hunter I if I Valley and other parts of north- r'4 J ern N.S.W. j . J J But the drought can't be ii I blamed for the 48,000 farmers j ;t| j and workers, most of them young j M | people, who have left the country- j j side for the city to find jobs and j " j opportunities. While these thous- j ! ands of people are leaving the " : ; I fertile Hunter Valley and the far ' , | north, the other side of the | picture shows unprecedented 1| prosperity for the big monopolies | there. | The Newcastle Morning Herald | '% !
