 "T elegraph's" slander O'DNEY: A deputation of Sydney waterside workers last Wednesday protested to the "Daily Telegraph" against an edtroriai which sianaered me Federation. Many job meetings protested against the "slanderous attack" and several called for the Federation to impose a black ban on , the discharge of news print for the Telegraph. The deputation was led by the Federal organiser of the WWF (Mr. M. Wallington) and included seven members of the Sydney Branch's Pen sions and Wages Committee. Reluctance by the Chief of Staff to see the delegation was quickly, over come when it was suggested that he might prefer fo face 4,000 Sydney wharfies. The editorial on March 31 said: "The stoppage on the wharves in Mel bourne yesterday gives color to the suspicion that these attacks on dif- . ferent areas of the nation's economy are part of a Communist-inspired cam paign." The attack included a rehash of Mr. Justice Gallagher's outburst which called watersiders "dupes of political agitators bent on destroying the economy of the country." "Branch News" (organ of the Syd ney Branch WWF) said the editor in a most arrogant way claimed the views expressed were "simply the opinion of the paper." The deputation would not accept as "opinion" outright lies and distortions. The editorial in question carried a statement by the director of the Asso ciation of Manufacturers calling for Government action to reduce overseas shipping freight rates. Yet the Telegraph omitted from the Federation's letter published the fol-' lowing day figures which showed that overseas shipowners took Â£433 million out of the Australian economy last- year.
