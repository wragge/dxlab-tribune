 | Airlines I mess o -x /UENZIES', rejection of NSW | Government compromise s terms on the Dubbo air service ! . dispute has also damaged the I local Liberal cause by revealing | once again that the Liberals in j this issue -are simply acting on j behalf of R. M. Ansett, Aus- | tralia's biggest private transport | monopoly. | In this case, the N.S.W. Govern- I ment took an unusually commend- ! able stand against monopoly when a S conflict developed, last year over j the proposed re-allocation of the i Sydney-Dubbo air route from Ansett's ? subsidiary, Airlines of N.S.W. to the I independent local airline, East-West. I federal Liberal Government moves | to force the issue in Ansett's favor met with a State Government rebuff I and a High Court decision support- I ing the State Government. I The Federal Government then 8 agreed to a -proposal, originally ad- | vanced by the N.S.W. Government, 1 for a conference to re-examine allo- I cation of N.S.W. air routes. I N.S.W. also proposed, in the in- terests of -the Dubbo townspeople I (who have been without a direct f service for months) that the two j airlines share the service pending | agreement on reallocation. I Menzies has now refused this, giv- S ing as excuse what is obviously | the Ansett company's view that the I expense of temporary staffing I would be "uneconomic". S The N.S.W. Liberals have kept I very quiet on this issue, particularly j because the State Country Party i leaders some months ago came out in opposition to the policy adopted 8 by the Menzies Government against 8 the local airline in which some I Country Party personalities have in- J vestments.
