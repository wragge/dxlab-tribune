 . - Page II By June Mills JAST week in Tribune, Bill Wood wrote about 75 years of May Day celebration in Aus tralia, and we made a special appeal for May Day donations to the Tribune Fund. Many workers can recall the early May Day celebrations. For example, when I was a child I was dancing the maypole on the Yarra Bank (Mel bourne) with other children from the Socialist Sunday School; other mem bers of the labor movement could go back" even further. Because of its international and Aus tralian national significance May Day is really something special, so that our appeal for special donations should -receive support from every reader. , This week the Fund has reached well over the £1,000 mark and we are on the way to the target of £1,500. Ail average of a little over £36 a week and we'll make it by June 30th. There are many donors who wa\- rant a special mention, those from Sydney known to us personally, but some like P. O'Dea (Cairns), who reg ularly sends his contribution. This week it's very good to see a collection of £3/4/- from B.H.P. New castle, and of course we'd miss Butch Wharton if he never failed to send his donations down. Our friend Bill White, whose name last week was omitted when he sent £6 for "Elfrida Morcom" for Collaroy, Norm, Sam, Henry, is one of the best. Sorry, Bill.
