 May Day boost for the Fund fillip £I,500f By JUNE MILLS \A/ITH just on three weeks to May Day, there's still time for response to the special May Day appeal for Tribune Fund. This week the amount received in small donations is not as high as last week, but the overall position has improved. An average of £26 a week to June 30 and we'll reach our target of £1,500. Special thanks go to "Another Old W.A. Pensioner" who sent £5 dona tion with a letter expressing appre ciation of Tribune's work for the finest cause in the world— the libera tion of mankind, irrespective of creed or color. He also sent me the words of "The Red Flag" and said that the poem was composed by a young Irishman after listening to an ad dress by a socialist during the dock ers' strike in London in 1889. Eng lish workers collected £40,000 to aid the strikers and £30,000 was collected in Australia. "The Red Flag" has been sung by workers all over the world when celebrating May Day, and no doubt some will sing it oh May Day this year. When readers think of May Day I hope they think of Tribune Fund and help us leap up to the £1,500. Donations this week have been re ceived from: Another Old W.A. Pensioner £5, M. Williams 1/3, J.
