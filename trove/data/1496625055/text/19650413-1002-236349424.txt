 Where are the women? 117ILL someone please tell the V Sydney May Day Committee about the birds and the bees? ThA Committee's one-eved mon- sters have, apparently without feminine co-operation, spawned a May Day poster depicting "men only" as. bearers and followers of the standard of freedom. Where are the underpaid women garment-workers who made the neat suits worn by the poster's marchers â€”all of them clearly strangers to hard yakker? Where are the mothers who bore and reared these neat young march ers, then went out to work to earn the money for schoolbooks and shoes which their husbands' wages could not afford? What about; the office girls, with out whom business managers, trade- union secretaries and May Day or ganisers would collapse and stagger out for liquid revivers served to them by female bar-assistants? WHAT ABOUT THE WOMEN? International Women's, Day cele brations are over. I.W.D. has ap parently been wrapped away in mothballs for another year, at least by the May Day Committee, happy in their masculine half-world. Someone, please tell them the facts of life, of women in the work force, of women in trade-union auxiliaries, in P. & C. and Progress Associations, job-delegates, and so on, and that even a retiring Gov ernor General has two eyes where the role of women in public life is concerned. Some day they may learn about the other half. Meantime, undeter red by masculine neglect, we wom en are busy organising for glorious TV/fnv Tlav Gwyn Williams (East Sydney).
