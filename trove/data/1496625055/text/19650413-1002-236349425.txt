 Higher prices in Cairns AS a visitor to Cairns I find the cost of living highâ€” apart from the fantastic charges for flats, rooms and taxis, a copy of "Truth" costs l/3d, "The Courier Mail" 9d. Beer costs almost 2d per ounce. - Everything here is king-size, ex cepting workers' wages. Another disturbing feature is ra cial discrimination against the Ab origines, in certain hotels. As "A Communist disdains to conceal his views" (Karl Marx) I ask you to publish the name of one hotel guilty of racial discrimination. This is the Australian Hotel (ironical, isn't it?) where they are barred! On the other hand the working people are very friendly and took a great interest in the 'Mt. Isa dis pute. Most people to whom I have spoken agreed that the men had a strong case. Fred Martin (Cairns)
