 "Hamlet" here soon A magnificent new version of Hamlet will soon open at the Savoy, Theatre, Sydney. Dir ected by Grigori ICozintsev, who directed Don Quixote, with music by Shostakovich, it captures in an unforgettable way the action, beauty ana violence of the medieval story. Set in a castle like the Elsinore castle of Shakespeare, the camera sweeps over lace-foamed sweeps of the sea, deep towers and battlements, forbidding draw bridges, vast heavy-doored rooms and corridors, with every detail of the period. Hamlet played by Innokenti Smoktunovsky is ..an iron- willed, uncompromising Prince whose love of his father and country drives him to the unmasking and revenge of his father's murder. The black-browed murderer and his sophisticated grovel lers, who form the strength in numbers, do all to turn Hamlet off, even ordering his execution in England. Ophelia's delicate beauty and helplessness as she is trapped in the castle intrigue is branded on the mind in her "madness" scene. Comments on the premiere of Hamlet in England were: DAILY MAIL (Cecil Wilson): "Russia's share in the Shakespeare celebrations is a magnificent tribute from a people who revere our Bard as if he were one of their own. THE GUARDIAN (James Kennedy):- "... as to the cost I have never seen on a British stage— or even in Olivier's great film for that matter— players in "Hamlet" who looked so impressively convincing as these Russians." SUNDAY TIMES (Dillis Faull): "The film, black-and- white on a wide screen, is magnificient in playing, setting and interpretation." OBSERVER (Edmund Tracy): ". . . Shostakovitch has written a subordinate, wholly functional score; his music is designed simply to support and reinforce the image, never take our attention away from it." Hamlet will open at the Savoy, Sydney, a week from Friday.
