 | U.S. "anti peace" j QUESTION: When is a "peace offer" not a peace offer? S | ANSWER: Last Wednesday, when American President j j Johnson spoke. j j LJEADLINED as an offer for "unconditional" negotiations j I over the Vietnam conflict, the Johnson speech in Tact | ; represented no change in US policy . . . except in one j | respect: it revealed that the US Government was afraid j | to plunge on with its naked war of aggression without s ! making some concession to the wave of concern and j protest throughout the world. I 1 What Johnson did was to pronounce what was already I f condemned as futile weeks ago by commentator Walter \ j L ippman and others ... a US demand for the unconditional | I SURRENDER of the Vietnamese people of both north and j | south. And Johnson wrapped this up in high-sounding j i words about "discussions". , | I There is no possibility that the Vietnamese people who j ! have fought the French, Japanese and US overlords for 25 j S years, will now meekly accept US colonialist masters, either j \ as militarists or billion-dollar investors. I I For that is what Johnson has proposed. While speak- | I i no- about "unconditional" talks, he laid down:-— | | pre-condition Number One: The USA will not get | | out of Vietnam (although she has, under the 1954 Geneva j i Agreement, no right to be there). . ' ' //+-i u" I I Pre-condition Number Two: The USA will not talk S v'th the South Vietnam Liberation Front (the only organ i- | ! sation representative of the majority of South Vietnam | j. p-oole. who are struggling for the independence promised j I them at Geneva). . , ... _ j ! In short, the US Government, fearing defeat by the j ! South Vietnam people and seeing no result from its r»orrr ! hombing of North Vietnam, has turned to diplomatic means ! while continuing to extend its acts of military aggression.
