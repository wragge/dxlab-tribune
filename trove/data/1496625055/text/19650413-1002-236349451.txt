 MOVE TO UPSET A.W.U. BALLOT yDELAIDE: A move to upset the ballot for secretary of the South Australian branch of the AWU has failed. The Chief Judge of the Common wealth Industrial Court (Sir John Spicer) rejected an application by the previous secretary, Mr. E. O'Connor, to declare the ballot void. Mr. O'Connor was defeated in the election by Mr. D. Cameron. A parcel of 107 ballot papers alleged to have been fished out of the Port River was left out of account by the Judge in his ultimate decision. "There was included in the parcel a crude note designed to suggest that the parcel had been collected from the sea on a fishing line, and expert evi dence indicated that the parcel had been immersed in salt water," said the Judge. He said it was quite impossible on the evidence to reach the conclusion that these were votes properly cast for the O'Connor ticket. "The evidence, or rather lack of it, is equally consistent with the wrongful completion of blank papers by some person who subsequently immersed i kpm in coif tuofpr fnr fin p nnrnnca nf lliVill All JUll nuiwj XVSA tliv creating evidence which would assist the applicant in his enquiry," he said. The Judge found that minor irregu larities in the ballot involving some 70 votes could not have altered the result.
