 | Protest ' | j from an American | author Among the thousands of ' prominent Amer i canst who have been protesting against their Govern ment's aggressive policy i in Vietnam is well-known | author Lewis Mumford. j He has written a letter of j sharp criticism which was I printed in the letter col- ; umns of the Melbourne! | "A&"- j "The time has come for j someone to speak out on behalf of the great body I off Americans who regard ! with abhorrence the ! course to which the White I House is committing the | United States in Viet- nam. i As a holder of the Presidential Medal of Freedom. I have a duty j j to say plainly, and in public what J | millions of patriotic fellow Amer- f j icans are saying in the privacy of 1 I their homes; namely, that the 1 j course the White House is now ! I following affronts both our prac I I tical judgement and our moral | j sense. j | From the beginzJng, the pres- j | ence of American forces in Viet- j I nam, without the authority of the | | United Nations, was a defiance of j 1 our own solemn commitment when we helped to form that body. 1 Our steady invotvement with the 5 military dictators who are waging I civil war in South Vietnam, with | our extraivagant financial support | and underhanded military co- S operation, is as indefensible as our | Government's original refusal to . ! permit a popular election to be held in Vietnam lest Communism I should be installed by popular | vote. ! The attempt now to pin the | whole blame on the Government | of North Vietnam deceives no one I except those whose wishful think- | ing originally committed us to | our high-handed intervention: the I same set of agencies and intelli- | genccs that inveigled us into the | Bay of Pigs disaster. ! Instead of using political adroit- | ness to rescue our country from | the military miscalculations and S political blunders that created our | iniposible position in Vietnam, the | White House is casting all caution 1 to the wind. I This betrayal is all the more 1 sinister because it is obstinately , I committing us to the very m j- . I tary policy that Americans I jected when so overwhelming j | defeating the Republican candi- j I date. , i I We are horrified by the munedi- , | ate prospect of having our coun- ! try's fate in the hand of lead® | who, time and again, have sh | their inability to think straign , S correct their own errors, or to g j out of a had situation without | creating a worse one. . . I There is only one way m I the White House can irciiiove tn | opposition or regain conV .jie and that is to turn hack fr I course taken and to seek a | way out; LEWIS MUMFORD- CAmenia, New F® )
