 Boilermakers call for I basic wage of £22 I SYDNEY: The Boilermakers' Society last week in I Sydney called for a basic wage of £22 a week. CEDERAL Conference . of the Society, which represents 28,000 members, said "the basic wage should be a living wage and be the highest wage that the full, resources, of the community fully employed can provide". "Increases in the cost of living and as shown in the consumer price in dexes that no less than £22 per week should be minimum basic wage claim ed." Conference called on the Australian Council of Trade' Unions to implement the previous Congress decision to con duct the research to provide the neces sary evidence to support this claim. The Boilermakers said that the movement of prices should be reflect ed in increased wages but in addi tion to this, increased profits and productivity should also be the major factors in establishing a real living needs wage. Wage case At present the Commonwealth Arbit ration Commission has spent 20 days in connection with the unions' cur rent basic wage claim of 9/- to 13/- increase depending on the State. This claim will only compensate the workers for the eroding of their wages through price increases since the Corh- mission granted the £1 increase last year. This modest claim has not prevent ed the Federal Government and em ployers from coming out in opposition to it.
