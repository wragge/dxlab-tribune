 STOPPAGE EXPOSES BHP NEWCASTLE: The 24-hour strike last week of 60 maintenance ironworkers from the sinter plant at the Newcastle Steel Works has further exposed the low wages and the company's hard line policies. The men went on strike in protest against the BHP's slowness to nego tiate on a demand for a £3 a week bonus. . At present the bonus for ironwork ers is £3 a fortnight, which is about £6 less thapi that being paid to trades men. The company has been forced to offer a larger bonus to tradesmen to try and attract these men to the steelworks. This is still a lot' less than tradesmen are receiving in many outsiae industries. . Average take home pay for an iron worker at the steelworks is about £18 a week and because of this work ers are forced to try and build up their pay with overtime. - This year ironworkers . from most departments at the Newcastle works have taken strike action for increased , bonuses. The BHP refuses to recognise trade unions as negotiating bodies over bonuses. It claims this is a matter between the men and the superintendent. While the company does not re cognise unions to negotiate it does on the other hand hold the unions re sponsible for their members taking strike action. Last week's sinter plant stoppage was no exception, the company im mediately took the Ironworkers' As sociation to a compulsory conference before the State Industrial Commis sion in Sydney. ' : A stoppage of boilermakers, iron workers and crane drivers was also recently held at Australian Iron and Steel in Sydney over the company refusal to recognise unions as ! tiating bodies to dear with over-award : payments. j
