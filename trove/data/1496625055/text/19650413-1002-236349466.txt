 [?] No " gradualism " I in fight game fl By "Challenger" . 1 CONGRATULATIONS to Tony Barber, Austra lian Olympian and Sydney wharf ie, who easily and convincingly won his first fight as a professional against Queensland mid dleweight champion Frank Roberts. Referee Vic iPatrick stopped the fight in the fifth round, when it was obvious that Roberts; was hopelessly outclassed. Roberts had lost one previous fight and had never been knocked off his feet. Within hours of Barber's win ning debut, Sydney Stadium man ager, Harry Miller was wishing to match him with the Australian middleweight champion Reg Hayes and Hayes' manager Em McQuillan was offering £150 to £100 that Hayes would do a job on young Barber. This procedure is nothing unusual for Australian boxing, nor for that matter, is the retort by Barber's trainer Bill McConnell, that he would take Barber along gradually. The facts about the Australian fight game are, that there are not enough fighters around for the young fighters to be brought along gradually and in any case the likes of youngsters such as Tony Barber are given endurance tasks right from the start of their very tough careers'. The fact that Barber was taken from three-round amateur con tests to 12 rounds for his very first bout is proof of this. It is rationalising to think that the development of a boxer con sists in putting him in with a much inferior opponent over a longer number of rounds, just to see if he can knock him over when .he's a bit more tired. That there are a number of amateur boxers capable of hold ing their own against the leading professionals is proved by the records, of such former amateurs as the Taylor brothers, rMaxie Carlos and now Tony Barber himself. As -Barber looks like suffering the same fate -as others of being rushed into big "long" fights, through , lack of opposition, it would he a welcome thing if Har- ry Miller did match Barber with Reg Hayes, but over three or four rounds, and for the same main event pay. /j This way, it would be only mainly boxing ability that would count and Barber would not be jp in danger" of getting hurt through K' running out of "gas". - It could also do much to stim- 111 ulate interest in Australian box- Si iRs- iii ? - ii Rugby League f By Jim Sharrock qJ THE "Match of the day" he- t'l tween St. George and New- ':% town at the Sydney cricket ground, again proved the super- SI iority of Saints in Rugby League. pj Their three tries to nil were III proof of this. M The first half ended in no 1 scores. The failure of both sides l to land goals was understand- if able, as there , is no other ground 11 that greases the hall up more than that patch in the centre of |j the Sydney cricket ground. S . , The first half, was a duel be- Sp tween the forwards, and a due IS worth watching. Mostly these g duels end in a brawl, but not glf this one, as it was football all fig the way. I|| During this half Saints made iff several attempts to use their fM backs to break through, but were iff unsuccessful. This must go to 1|| the credit of Newtown's defence. ||j Their backs appeared to have ||| . that little extra speed coupled l|| with Brian Graham's solid game |i as full back to "retrieve" the 111 position. ($9 So for the first half honors f|j were even, a surprise to most of |S the fans. |h In the second half Saints open- ||| ed up with a superb try, and f|| from then on Saints were in com- 11 mand, not that they had it all Ifl their own way. Newtown battled ||| on gamely, and in fact came hack ||f in the last few minutes of play ||| in a determined effort to place ||| a score on the board. |1 It is worth going to see New- || town play for this feature alone — they never throw the towel in m and always give the fans a go $f| for their money no matter how m far behind they are. ||| The unfortunate accident where ||| — Reg Gasnier (Saints) "floored" slf| Brian Graham (Newtown) will j|| be talked about in League circles for a long time to come. There ,:|a was an exchange of kicking be- |9 tween the full backs, Langlands and Graham. Graham had got his $ji kick in when Gasnier coming full t9g speed got him with his shoulder j |w and floored him. .3 Ws Most of my hillite friends ag- ; gjjB reed that a smart player like f«S Gasnier could have avoided the j j h'i| collision. It was unfortunate be- ; i i:|g cause Gasnier is generally regard- ;;jM ed by fans of all colors to be a . clean player who has to take j|g| more than he gives. The decision nf of the referee to award a penalty ; and a caution was a good deci- aw sion. lw In the battle of tactics New- . 9 town did a deal of kicking. It is Wk hard to understand that with a : JH greasy ball they put the ball in \ the air so much, and did not use . n the "grubber kick". The big question is how to pen- » etrate .Saints defence? This I mB believe will call for new ideas, |« new tactics. You can't beat |B Saints playing Saints' game. || b.n;f. VC-— F'i gn Raper «>>':. Gee? ge> ' ar.d ' . 9 Graham (Newtown). ' I '
