 Wharfies stand for right to strike PERTH ; Australian workers would never forsake their right to strike, waterside work ers agreed at the annual WA All Ports Conference last week Fremantle Branch secretary G. Harris said that delegates had dis cussed a recent statement by Mr. Justice Gallagher that direct action was abhorrent and that no such right existed in Australia. The Fremantle Conference had de clared that while employers could ignore conciliation and arbitration, order lockouts and raise prices without consulting anyone, the trade union movement had more right to strike than the employers had to ignore conciliation and arbitration, order lockouts and raise prices without consulting anyone. Conference had declared further that Australian workers had largely received and maintained their stand ard of living by striking when ap proaches to arbitration had failed.
