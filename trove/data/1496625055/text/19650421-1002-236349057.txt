 Discussions aid Democracy J AST week I attended a "Panel discussion" at the headquart ers of the Young Liberals in Vaucluse. Among the questions raised Mt. Isa, Vietnam, the Soviet Union, education, court control led ballots. As a guest speaker I was treated with courtesy; although it may seem odd to know that a Com munist Party member is listened to with the same respect as the other members of the "Panel". This does not mean that the Communist viewpoint is accepted nor that the young Liberals - re frain from expressing anti-Com munist views. However, it would seem from this and previous experiences that those attending want to particip ate in democratic discussion with people of opposing views. Therefore I respect the sincerity of the participants' views, although they are mistaken about Com munist philosophy. If such methods of discussion were taken wider, not only among youth but with all political organi sations, democracy would be strengthened among Australians. E. Maher (Sydney).
