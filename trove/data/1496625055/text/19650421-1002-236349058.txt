 Askin & Ansett W"Y has Menzies decided to participate in the current NSW election campaign? Since 1949 when he became Prime Min- ister ne has held himself aloof from participating in State elec tion campaigns. Is it because he is making a last ditch stand is to save his "buddy boy", Reg Ansett? Menzies and Ansett both know that if Labor wins this election the Gov ernment will not back down on its decision regarding the Dubbo air line dispute. Menzies is making a last stand to give Ansett control of the NSW Air ways, because if the Liberals win, this will be the concession given by Askin for the Prime Minister's parti cipation in the elections. Help keep the NSW airways the property of NSW. (Let the campaign slogan be "A VOTE FOR ASKIN IS A VOTE FOR ANSETT". L. Marshall (Auburn, NSW).
