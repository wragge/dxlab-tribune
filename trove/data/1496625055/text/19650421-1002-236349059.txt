 Australian eomSe strips | ISTENING to Robyn Boyd on Channel 2, "Design in Austra lia" (April 5) I was amazed to hear him say that Australian hum-... ourous strip was absent from many papers and journals because they were not up to the standard of cartoonists of earlier days, such as Dyson and the two Lindsays. I am staggered if Mr. Boyd really believes this. It is common know ledge today that the rich combines controlling newspapers and journals prefer to buy overseas syndicated strips at so much a dozen. Australian, artists need the work, and it is high time for a change in order to give them a chance. E. Leahy (Ramsgate).
