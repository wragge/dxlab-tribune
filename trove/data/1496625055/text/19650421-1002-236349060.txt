 grab m Royal Commission into winemaking yDELAfDE: The SA Labor Government is considering a Royal Commission into the winemaking industry. This follows recent trouble in the industry in which winemakers refused to pay reasonable prices to' grape- growers. This was done despite the healthy profits of makers and the serious decline in the living standards of growers: A deputation from the Wine Grap-- growers' Council met Labor Premier Walsh and discussed the problem. After the deputation, .the Premier said a Royal Commission was "es sential." He said that some growers had. their incomes reduced to £10 or £11 per week. . The Growers' Council President (Mr. S. Dyer) said that the Council had pointed out to the Premier that "despite two price increases on wines in the two main consumer States, Vic toria and NSW, the winemakers had refused to give growers any benefits from these rises. "Conversely, they have refused, des pite the cheaper material available to pass reduction on to the consumer in the form of cheaper wine." The Council had previously declar ed its intention of establishing a Wine Grape Marketing Board -to stabil ise prices and give growers a lair deal. The Labor Government has promis ed to help Growers establish tne board.
