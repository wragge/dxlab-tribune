 US should pay compensation mil in i MJi/iwmiiimii uwiuu una 'I'tui first instalment of Presi dent Johnson's promised mil lions of dollars of aid for South East Asia should go in compensa- tion to North Vietnam for the des truction wrought by the American aggressors on non-aggressive North Vietnam. After the American Civil War, the United States claimed, and was paid, compensation from Great Britain for losses sustained by the U.S. through actions of ships sold to the Confeder ates by Britain. So there is a good precedent for it. But, whether precedent or not, North Vietnam is owed compensa tion by the U.S. for its murderous aggression, and pressure should be kept up to ensure that the Yanks pay for their crimes. K.
