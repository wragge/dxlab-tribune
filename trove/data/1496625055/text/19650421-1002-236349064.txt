 Wealth is not for bloodbath jANBERRA: Labor Minister McMahon can't see any connection between conscrip tion of young people for the Vietnam war and conscription of wealth for the same pur pose. He indicated this in replying to Mr. D. Curtin, Labor "NSW, who asked: "In view of the fact that the blood ballot has been completed, thus showing the Government's determin ation to conscript Australia's sons for the bloodbath in Asiaâ€”" After intervention by the Speaker, Mr. Curtin replaced the term blood bath by "cold-blooded murder" and, after further reproof by the Speaker, said: "In view of the fact that the Gov ernment intends to spend an enorm ous amount on arms and war mater ial, does the Government intend to conscript wealth to a degree com parable to the conscription of man power?" .Mr. McMahon said it was a "regrettable and unwholesome" note to introduce into a discussion on national service. . Mr. Calwell: "The conscription of 20-year-old kids is unwholesome". Mr. McMahon said he saw "no relationship" between national ser vice and "the second part of the question."
