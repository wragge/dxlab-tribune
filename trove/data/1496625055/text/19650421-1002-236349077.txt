 BHP metal workers win pay increase AAELBOURNE: A 12 months struggle by metal workers on the BHP refinery project at Crib Point, Victoria, has re sulted in the . winning of over- award wage increases greater than £13 a week. This wage increase Is included in an agreement recently negotiated be tween the unions and the three main contractors on the project. The three contractors are Chicago Bridge-Lennox, John Brown (Aust.) Pty. Ltd. and World Services and Construction Pty. Ltd. The agreement came into effect on March 25 and will remain until March 31, 1967, and thereafter until rescind ed by the parties. An earlier agreement covering building workers resulted in a car penter receiving approximately £33/19/- a week. A fitter under the Metal Trades Agreement will now receive about £34 a week. This latest agreement provided for an over-award payment of £5/16/6, fares £1/10/- a week, and travelling time allowances averaging about £6 a week. About 1,500 metal workers are at present on the site. An undertaking was also given that any sub-contractors engaged on the site are also to observe the same wage rates and conditions. Assistant secretary of the Boiler makers Society's Melbourne Branch, Mr. J. Roulston, said in Sydney last week that the Society was fined £970 under the penal clauses of the Arbitration Act during the early part of the struggle for these demands. He said that over the latter part, of the campaign the . workers success fully defeated the employers' at- tempts to have bans and limitations clauses included in the agreement. The agreement states that it should not be used as evidence or precedent on any other site in which the con tractors and the members of the union are engaged.
