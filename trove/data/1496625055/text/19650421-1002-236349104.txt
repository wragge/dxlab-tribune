 OVERTIME BAH ipERTH: Mefral trades work- ers at Alcoa refinery, Kwinana, have decided that they" will ban all overtime until six men blacklisted by metropolitan employers are re-employed and reimbursed for loss of wages. The six boilermaker welders were dismissed for alleged "misconduct" after a work to rules move on con struction jobs at the refinery. About 40 workers discussed the blacklisting at a noon meeting out side the refinery gates on April 15. The meeting followed one in Fre- mantle at which the Metal Trades Federation decided to recommend its affiliated unions to ban overtime in firms which had refused to employ the six men. "We don't believe our men. should work overtime while other men are out of work," Boilermakers' Union secretary F. G. Grenfell said last week. "Four of the dismissed men are still out of work." "Some of the six who tried to get other work at Fremantle were told that the employers had rejected their applications because they were told to do so by the Employers' Feder ation." Emplpyers' Federation is becoming increasingly vicious in its attempts to prevent a big break-through on over-award and other payments. It is now attacking Trades and Labour Council Secretary J. Coleman for up holding the workers' right to strike, as "even to advocate a strike in WA. offends the law".
