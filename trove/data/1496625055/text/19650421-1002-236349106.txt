 [?] - -—g pff Gymnastic training | for strength, beauty % By The Challenger rjl Those of us who have seen'top gymnasts in action llf will agree that the sport produces graceful, beauti- S fullv developed physiques. , i# THI fact will no doubt be borne in mind by nearly 200 girls from all parts of NSW who will attend the first junior gymnastic coaching camp in Australia next weekend. It is to be held at the Narrabeen Lakes NatioVial Fitness Camp. Leading gymnasts and coaches will attend the camp, which has been or ganized by the junior committee of the NSW Amateur Gymnastic Associ ation. Some of the prominent gymnasts and coaches who will coach and lec ture are: the organizer Miss Denise Edwards, women's technical adviser to the NSWAGA and a leading NSW gymnast; 1964 Olympic women repres entatives, Val Roberts, Barbara Flet cher and Jan Bedford; Mrs. Nellick ! -1 Jol, who is considered the best worn- en's gymnastics coach in Australia- « 1956 Olympian Bruce Sharp, 1964 Olympians .Ted Trainer and Carl Rod. V well and the 1965 NSW under 16 and t % 18 coaches John Purnell and Bob Elphiriston. ''si It is hoped that these camps will f increase in number along with the quality and amount of facilities avail- able for their use. In the Soviet Union, V the benefit of the abundant amount of M free sporting facilities is reflected in ('£ the achievements of its sportsmen and women in the Olympics and other international sport. Also, those wishing for immediate ill proof of what good coaching and fa- 11 cilities can do, should make sure ol gl seeing the Great Moscow Circus at 111 present in Sydney. The feats of the 11 Michael Nicolaev Group, of gymnasts || on a round bar are fantastic. | I Ex-US President Eisenhower provid- pi ed the public image for a lot of golf- 1| ers— and some of his political oppon- M ents maintain that he took his golf pg so seriously, that he spent more time Ft on the fairway than in the Whitehouse. L'lj However it is the big commercial sponsors, who are mainly responsible for attracting new blood to the game. fqj So much so, that precautions have Mi to be taken to control the large num- ber of professional players, who are iji eagerly cluttering up the fairways of |m the pro tournaments, in an endeavour |» to try and win some of the fantastic Ws prize money being offered. |1| In the U.S. the Carling Open, to be 151 held in Massachusetts this August ||| will be offering total prize money ol |i| 200,000 dollars and is sponsored by a fll brewery. mi The Masters Gold tournament, won ||| last week by Jack Nicklaus in record 111 breaking style, offered prizes to theffl value of £57,000. Ill Last year genial Jack topped the&|| prize money earnings by winning $113,000, about $100 more than hisg| nearest rival Arnold Palmer. With thisg type of money in the offing it is easypj to reason why so many golfers areLf| eager to give the "pro ranks" a try.p| To, overcome the reported cluttering \ % up of the courses, by many "unquali-J fied" pros the Professional Golf As- J| sociation in America has set UP .a|| special school in Florida to train mm tournament pros and only those witn |||| graduation certificates will be eligible |||| to enter PGA tournaments. j g|| Although the explanation by tnf pj| PGA seems rational enough, many an "unqualified" pro will quite P0SS1|| lli reason things differently and see tnjs mm whole thing as a form of monopoly ||| move on the part of the sponsors ana rag the already firmly entrenched Pros' H On the one hand the costs of sppn- jg| soring already popular, tournament , g is .kept down, and on the other han » g|f hardly any player would scream aoo n a limit being put on the number ||| his opponents. . the || This type of reasoning is an |g more plausible, when the business gra manufacturing golfing equipmen, g| taken into consideration. . t if Already, it has been estimated mm this year, golfers will buy £66 rTanU.
