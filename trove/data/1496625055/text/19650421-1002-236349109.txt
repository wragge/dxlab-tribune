 Nauruans call for j Independence now j SYDNEY : A meeting of more than 500 Nauruans last j Wednesday told a visiting United Nations mission that they I no longer wanted to he administered by the Australian Gov- I ernment. | THEY said that they wanted immediate independence. A leader of the Nauruan people, Mr. Selwyn Bernicke, is. reported to have told the mission, "I con sider Nauru is ready for independ ence". Mr. Bernicke represented Nauru at the United Nations and in talks with the Ajstralian Government about the future of the island, which is 2000 miles north-east of Sydney. j During talks with the Australian j Government last year the Nauruans | asked for aid in restoring their, island. I Four-fifths of the island has been j uninhabitable by extensive phosphate g mining for almost 50 years. i The Australian Government refused j the request. I Previously the Nauruans had re- i fused an Australian offer to resettle | them on Curtis Island, off the ! Queensland coast, because the Aus- I tralian Governemnt would not allow them full autonomy. "Wrong types" THE chairman of the Workers' Federation in Papua-New Gui nea has criticised the majority of whites who come up to the Terri tory as being of the "wrong type". He is Mr. Oala Oala-Rurua. Discussing the recent wage cuts for New Guinea Government work- , ers in the quarterly publication "New ! Guinea", he said: â€ž I "The majority of Australians who j come up to the Territory are "wrong types" who would find it hard to I get the sort of money and job they | are doing here if they remained in j Australia". ! They were reluctant to train Pap- | uans and New Guineans to take over j their jobs because they would lose &lt; everything if they did. j He said that the Government's j decision to lower wages was discri- j minatory because it ignored the ! principle of equal pay for equal | work. i
