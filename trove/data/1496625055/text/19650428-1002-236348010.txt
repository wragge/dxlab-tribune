The Jews fought back and the nazi army met fierce opposition. ' After' months of preparation thej ' Ghetto had risen in revolt. With typical cynicism the nazi attack began on the eve of Pass over (Jewish Easter). More than 3000 nazi soldiers took part in the ; final liquidation, and on May 16 \ von. Stroop reported that the former j Jewish quarter of Warsaw had-, ceased to exist. ' The Jewish fighters had only, self-made weapons, a few knives and some machine guns which were smuggled into the Ghetto, but they fought and resisted for 27 'days. The Warsaw Ghetto uprising will stand out as a battle for freedom, and equality. Last week representatives of for mer concentration camp inmates of the Allied Forces and of the Re sistance movement gathered in War. saw to commemorate the heroes. The- best service mankind can eive to those men, women and children who' died in the Warsaw Ghetto is to see to it that it will never happen again.
