 WA Uni students satire on society DERTH: The West Australian University Prosh (proces sion) again thumbed its bawdy nose at hypocrisy and society's sacred cows. With jibes and taunts it wound its way through most current news topics. The burning question of racial discrimination received the .most attention. Ku Klux Klan men .and their black victims, at times Tilled the -street; no less than four floats "used this theme. Protests against conscription were called for by a ragged bunch of soldiers whose banner ended with the words "Save a life, it might be your own." Behind a float carrying a slogan "Papal Bull — or How I Learned to Stop Wor rying and Love the Pill", young men threw pills to the crowd, and Mavis Bramston appeared on sev eral floats with slogans calling for "hands off" her show. Dawn and the A.S.U., Menzies and the conscription marbles and Rottnests' ban on cats also got their share of jibes. A news item in the student paper "Worst Australian" announced that Reg Hansetfc had successfully completed negotiations for pur chase Of Perth . Airport for the handsome sum of £23/2/6 to be paid off over a period of 25 years or 6,000 air trips, whichever ex pires first. Under a heading "Obscene Book Banned", another news item re ported that a "Defective Sergeant Malarkey," in charge of Victoria's State Police "Vise Squat" led his squad into Melbourne's Technical Book Shop and impounded 7,000 copies of a biology textbook used by secondary school children, as obscene within the meaning of the Act and that all students who had read the book were to be expelled from their schools. Though both Prosh and the "Worst Australian" have some cracks at waterside workers, a_ Mackie, etc., their satire was mainly well aimed at topical s jects — major and minor -- need ing protest. W.A. University s dents are obviously becoming more critical on current poll issues. .. . .. . 1
