 U.S. TORTURE ADMISSION US "Newsweek" magazine (April 26, 1965) admits that US-Saigon ; forces use torture to extract in formation from prisoners of war. This is forbidden by The Hague conventions. "Often there is no time for nice ties," the paper says. The South Vietnamese, it says, have been "forced" to "turn to threats and beatings to get the vital informa tion they need from reluctant guerillas." . The "excuse," of course, is that the other side also does it. No evidence of this is offered. "Despite all these efforts, the battle for intelligence is still be- ' ing won most consistently by the Viet C|ong," admits the. writer.
