 I Can Whisper I can whisper and I can sing, I was born into this world hollering; If I can't be heard talking I'm going to shout But no one on earth is going to drown me out. Chorus: Listen, there's a lot I've got to say, Or I'll shout it till you hear me anyway. I was born into this world like everyone - With a hungry belly to drive me on; I was born into this World with nothing else Than my own two nands to keep, myself. If I want, to eat, I've got to work, But I can go hungry if I like; I'll work if that's what I want to do But no-one else will tell me to. I was born into this world with nothing but time And every minute of it's mine. My time is precious, it's all I've got, And I might sell it and I might not. . Everyone sells something, time's my "stock, I sell hours by the clock, - Time once gone won't come twice. It's my time, mister â€” and my price. Don Henderson.
