 For Don and Geoff "We've met singers at the station We've met singers in relation To the Dispute in the Isa every day: But we've never met such jokers As the guys who now provoke us Into being what we should have been When first we did display The spirit and the will to fight That we should live another night â€” . To feel the uplift their spirit has portrayed! John McMahon. Tresident, Mt. Isa Trades and Labour Council.
