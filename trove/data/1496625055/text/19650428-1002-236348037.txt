 "Who Put The 'W' In AWU?" "There's a rumour going round the town, I'm called on to deny, That Edgar Williams is a Union man, it's a dirty communist lie, Another rumour has it Tom Dougherty's the same, He's taking out a libel suit to vindicate his narrie." . "Who put the W in AWU? Was it men like you and at the tail- -end of the queue. Or was it Edgar Williams and the Dunsfan palace crew? Something's . gotta go and it won't be WU. The executive said if a man went . back and was insulted for so doing They'd take the matter into court and pay the cost of suing, The question, said the magistrate, when the trial began, Is not who called the man a scab but who called the scab a man?" â€” From a song picked up in The Isa.
