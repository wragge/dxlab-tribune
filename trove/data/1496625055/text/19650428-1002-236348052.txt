 workers strike for more pay ADELAIDE: Building workers on the Reserve Bank build ing site, Victoria Square, stoDbed work in suDDort of an over-award allowance and a multi-storey' rate. The workers, made up of carpent ers, joiners, and builders' laborers, decided to hold a series of stop pages. This action flows from a five months' campaign of building unions during which 100 job meetings and some stoppages have taken place. Building workers want an industry agreement such as that applying in Victoria which provides for a 1/3 an hour over award payment to all employees of master builders and sub-contractors on their sites. They also want a multi-storey rate for men working higher than two storeys. The master builders arrogantly refused to consider the men's de mands. Building union officials feel that now things are coming to a climax, with a growing /illingness of build ing workers to act.
