 POLICE STATE ANTI- UNIONISM IN MT. ISA BRISBANE: The refusal by Mi Isa Mines to re-employ about 50 workers and the police interference at a union meeting Bast Thurs day at Mt. Isa has sparked off further protests to the Queensland Government. JAST Thursday, in the latest act of Police State anti- unionism under the Nicklin Government, police were sent to a combined unions meeting called to discuss the sacking of a worker. Reports from Mt. Isa say that police took down the names of unionists present at the meeting. The Disputes Committee of the Queensland Trades and Labor Council has called on the Nicklin Government to withdraw all pro clamations which in any way inter- ferred with the normal trade union activities and rights in Mt. Isa. A recent 24-hour stoppage of Elec trical Trades Union members fol lowed the dismissal by Mt. Isa Mines of an active union member. He was dismissed because he allegedly refused —as a sequel to the recent hitter dispute — to work with a certain individual. . Previous police actions at Mt. Isa during the dispute, included raids on homes and other premises, refusal to --allow- pickets near the mine gates, arrests of men and women over alleged incidents, and the secreting of police and a tape recorder inside the projection box of the- Star Theatre when mass meetings were being held there. A statement' issued by leaders of the Queensland Trades and Labor Council said: "About 50 decent Australian workers are refused employment for no other reason than that they were involved in a dispute and, in many cases, accepted the responsi bility of leadership thrust on them by the rank and file. "The Trades and Labor Council Disputes Committee is continuning victimised-pay to these unionists."
