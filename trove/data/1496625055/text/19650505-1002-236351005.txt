 [?] PUTTING BOATS i & BIKES ON ICE ii By "The Challenger" j 1 With the coming of winter, many people will I be putting their swimming costumes into moth- I halls and looking for an alternative sport to I swimming to pass the time. | IF we lived in a country With a more extensive winter there, is the chance that many sports - lovers would take to a couple of sports that are now popu lar in parts of the United , States and the Soviet Union. The two sports ; are iceboat- ing in the U.S. and motor cycle racing on ice in the Soviet Union. The iceboats are simply con structed of an eight foot run ner plank, a similar hull, three steel runners and about 60 . foot of sail. ; On a frozen lake and with a suitable wind the. iceboat, can reach high speeds and provide thrills enough for nearly every one. Some iceboaters claim that the sport . is relatively safe compared to car racing, as fric tion is greatly reduced and . any iceboater thrown . from his machine simply slides across the ice for about fifty yards. According to a recent Soviet Weekly, crowds of up to 25,000 spectactors sit in 25 de grees of frost watching the motor cycle ice races. In the Republic of Bashkiri, the popularity of the sport is partly attributed to the fact that the area has always been famous for its trick horsemen f and the motor cycles are seen I as a much faster and more I thrilling ' "steel steed". 1 However, another explana- | tion is the good organising and 1 facilities available to the en- I thusiasts. | - : « Clubs loan out motor cycles I free of charge, with outfits and I instructions, while club mem- bership fees are very small. ! It is obvious from Australia's I relatively mild winter climate, I that , the above two sports are I not very suitable for our condi- I tions. \ However, there ' are a number \ of things that could be done J with our swimming pools to I provide sports enthusiasts with j winter activity, and many f people are no doubt saying, f "If we "can't . heat our pools, | then why don't we freeze I ' therri." | This has already been done | with Sydney's Prince Alfred I Park swimming pool and the | crowds of ice-skaters that get | there attest to its .popularity. | ' i Mq.ck :of fhe day I The match of the day at the f Sydney Cricket Ground last I Saturday between St. George j r and Northern .Suburbs ended jj in a win for Norths and Saints 3 first defeat of the season, the I __ scores 17-14. | ip in tne last issue of "Tribune" I \ I April 28, I remarked that the I I !| chances of these two teams I I ' , for this particular game were I f ! equal. , I I In a seesaw game Norths I ! \ ! were on the day, just the best, | j play the game over again next | j ! week and Saints could by the j J same rule reverse the narrow ) i win margin. I , ' ; What is pleasing to rugby I ; league fans is that a team has j improved to such an extent II that they can challenge and II | beat (at times) the mighty I I Saints. This position answers |j | those critics who have said I 1 that it would be a -better com- 1 petition if Saints , did not stand | out so much ... this column || has put forward the opposite i view that for better football g . . '. let the other teams raise .11 their game up to Saints. 11 On some occasions Rugby || League fans have : been treated || during half-time periods to II exhibitions by the Amateur |l Athletics' of running, walking, ||| etc., the fans certainly have ap- 1 preciated these displays. |1 Amateur athletes, both men || and women, do a fine job for ii sport and for their country. II Rugby League matches pro- H vide them with a ready made H audience, which they must m also appreciate. g It is quite common on the g "Hill" to hear the remark, Eg "when are they going to put R the runners or ' walkers on R again?" ra If you agree with this view, || why not write to the rugby |g ' league officials and let them || know vour wishes.
