 Power workers waiting for reply from Commission i CYDNEY: Power house work ers throughout NSW are awaiting a reply from the Elec tricity Commission to their claims for a 35-hour week, guaranteed employment and increased wages. Negotiations to include these demands in a new award have taken place between the Commission and the NSW Labor Council Steering Com mittee. Four conferences have been held with the Commission since February. The unions on the Steering Commit tee include the Amalgamated Engin eers, Electrical Trades, Municipal Em- ployees, Australian Railways Union Building Workers Industrial and the Federated Engine Drivers and Fire, men. The unions say the demands can be more than met out of last year's operating profit of £H million. This profit was after setting aside about £17 million for new plant and a further £10 million for interest on loans and bonds.

At the same time the generating staff has been reduced by about 2 000 workers. ' Tltirmrv ftiA tAv«A ml 1,1 . wic oamv xuu uier& nas been six price reductions for bulk buyers of electricity. Many workers say that these price reductions should have been shared out to the domestic buyers. The unions' claims are aimed at preventing further sackings and for the profitability of the industry to bo shared by those who produce the power.
