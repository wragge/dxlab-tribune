 [?] Channel 9 and the elections By Eileen Allison "TTHE influence of the policy of Sir Frank Packer's Daily Telegraph was very evident in recent weeks on Channel , 9. This station has shown several programs that continue the cold war against the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, together with a whole hearted support of the Liberal Party and the DLP during the recent elections. The election campaign, as conduc ted by Channel 9, was very significant in the favored treatment given these two parties. David McNicholl, editor of the Daily Telegraph, interviewed Liberal lead, er Askin. It was obviously a free plug for Askin, so much so that one newspaper TV critic gave it a blast- Packer's Channel 9, also provided un limited advertising time to the DLP, ' # # & Danger Man (Thursday, 8.30 p.m.) is ,a particularly nasty series on Chan nel 9. It concerns the adventures of a British secret agent and every story features "red" spies as the villains. The series is very well directed and acted. And, unlike similar American shows, it is more restrained and therefore more effective. The prod ucer is Ralph Smart, well known for the films he made in the 1940s (Bush Christmas etc.). It is a pity that his talents are so misused. Crisis (8.30 p.m. Friday) and The Saint (7.30 p.m. Saturday), fre quently feature stories with the con tent expressed in Danger Man. Channel 2 joined in last Sunday week with Secret Agent, a stinker that starred Douglas Fairbanks, junior. It is no coincidence that these programs appear on popular viewing times between 7.30 and 10 each evening. Better shows are often pushed Lack until later.
