IB She's embarrassing, .is Mavis,. 11 They say she'll have . to go, 18 But we always turn the telly on || For the Mavis Bramston show. 'A The Yanks all say we need the Yanks: The North West Cape' II save us. || What we need's some big bronzed Anzacs || To back up dear old Mavis. m I've left the League for Purity, H And Bishop Muldoon's Fan Club, H 1 And I won't be buying Ampol, H If Mavis gets the shove.
