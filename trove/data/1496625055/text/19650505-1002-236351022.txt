 Pathway to freedom I SIDNEY: Maximum public activity would be needed in the coming weeks to force the Fed- eral Government to ac cept the proposal for a national referendum to remove two clauses in the Constitution which discriminated aga i n s t Aborigines, Professor F. Rose said in Sydney this week. Professor Rose, of the Hum boldt University (East Berlin) Anthropology Department, is in Australia for extended field research work in his special study of the Australian Abo rigines. He said that the proposal to hold a referendum later this year on Sec tion 127 of the Constitution was to be welcomed but could only be seen as a first step in removing the basic discrimination in the Constitu tion. Section 127 stated that Aborigines would not be included in any popul- yM ation census. s The proposal to delete this section |J|| of the Constitution was purely re- Jp cognition of historical development. |gg Before the war it would have been iBj impossible to make such a census ;||H when, for instance, 50% of the Abo- ||g| rigines in the Northern Territory mm were nomadic or tribalised. Today |g| with improvement in transport ana |gjg communications it would be a |g| simple matter. hi But the main discrimination in |B| the Constitution was to he found |ffi in Section 51, Professor Rose gg| warned. ||1 Section 51 (xxvi) laid it down that jn the Commonwealth had no powers to make laws for Aborigines in any g| State. P Until this Section was amended |g and the responsibility for the Abori- MS gines placed fairly and squarely on eh the Commonwealth Government tne Eg requirements of resolutions PaS_ B at the recent Easter Conference i Aboriginal Advancement could n g be fulfilled. g Under the present financial rel g tionships . between the Commo g wealth and States, the Comm B wealth would not give a penny Â® B to the States for the Aborigines. H Removal of Section 51 would . H able pressure from outside Austra g to be applied to force the ,, g wealth to carry . out its obligat g towards the Aborigines. 1
