 CAMPAIGN AGAINST | "FlY BY NIGHTMS" SYDNEY: The NSW Executive of the Building Workers Industrial Union has decided to launch a campaign to prevent "fly by night" builders and sub-contractors from robbing workers of wages and breaking down working conditions. A SSISTANT secretary of the union, ; Mr. T. McDonald, said that des pite the boom in the building industry there are an increasing number of small builders and sub-contractors going broke. "The main cause of the problem is that the principal contractor and var ious finance and real estate com panies, who have taken over the home building section of the industry, are forcing sub-contractors into accepting unreal tender prices," he said. "Sub-contractors then seek to solve their problems by breaking down job conditions and safety conditions." "This situation is fostering the dev elopment of racketeering in the indus try and what has been described as 'fly by night' contractors." ."These people not only rob work ers of their wages, but are de« frauding merchants and home build ers," Mr. McDonald said. Building workers have given numer ous examples where some parts of a building process has been "sub-con tracted" out to several different firms. A concreting job, for example, could be re-let out up to 10 times. The person at the end of the list provides the profit for the other nine, but usually is not able to pay his own workers who have to do the job. Mr. McDonald said the union has adopted the policy of holding the prin cipal contractor responsible for the workers wages, and has on many oc casions forced him to pay. "Over the last few weeks a number of disputes, involving stoppages of work has resulted in thousands of pounds being recovered by the union for the members." Late last month a strike on the Warringah Expressway, and a threat ened stoppage of thp whole project forced the principal cbntractor, Thiess Bros, to pay £700 in wages and holi day pay owing to 14 workers.
