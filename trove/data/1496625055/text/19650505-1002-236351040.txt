 Big business and I drought ravage I the land; By J. BAILES £2RAVE concern is being expressed everywhere today at the severe drought conditions that exist over a large part of Australia. Throughout South-East and Western Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, with only a slight variations, the posi tion is similar. Parched land, shortage of stockfeed, dried-up waterways and dams, starving sheep and cattle ravage the countryside, not to mention the evn more appalling conditions in Victooria where the bushfires have left their toll of ruined grasslands, forests, homes and buildings. Discussing conditions with pro ducers in many of the areas, I I heard the same story— the dams ; are empty. ! Some waterholes dry for the j first time in living memory. j We have been forced to sell j most of our sheep or cattle. j Those who sold their sheep I a couple of months ago tell of I getting 8/r to 10/- each for j theni. | In the worst areas today prices i are much lower — down to 2/6, I with a waiting list because of | congestion at the meatworks. I Even " in the heavier rainfall | areas nearer the coast, the I drought is extracting its terrible | toll. | A dairy farmer out from j Kempsey told me he had shot J his last six cows, they were | too poor to travel. | But much can be . done to | alleviate the disastrous effect of | drought. | Scientific knowledge exists j throughout the world today that | can overcome bad drought ! periods. | We have let our Government | allow the big land owning com- j- panies to take from the coun- | tryside vast profits and re-invest I it in industry. | We have also allowed the | Menzies Government to wa«ste- j fully use the excessive taxes it I collects from primary pro- j ducers and workers on so- 1 called defence measures. I It has failed to finance and I implement the measures that | could lead to far-reaching im- ! provements to provide against | long dry periods. | The recent relatively good j seasons have tended to hide the fact that a vast area of the land J mass of Australia has been j very poorly endowed by nature. Millions of words have been j written about this fact and ! numerous plans designed to aid I nature to overcome the weak- nesses of poor rainfall, erosion, | floods and so on. I In the famous Bradfield irri- I gation scheme. Dr. Bradfield | showed how the coastal waters | now flowing to waste in the sea 1 cm Id be turned into the inland I flowing rivers, caiTymg water to | dry inland river beds. I But the scheme required the I expenditure of many millions of | pounds and the excuse of the | Government then is the same ! as today — we cannot afford I the money. I The last war showed that I when the need is great, we can | find the money. f And there is no greater need I today than for Australia to com- I mence a nationwide plan for j large scale water conservation, f irrigation, reafforestation and I soil conservation and improve- J ment; ' I There is a vast wealth of ex- j perience to draw from at the j present time, the great water j - conservation and irrigation i schemes that have been or are j being built in the Soviet Union, ! the USA and China. 9 We must use this wealth of I | scientific knowledge now in the j j wunu tu uumuat arougnts ana 5 | floods and to improve and de- J j velop our land as well as sec- I j ondary industry. j i A national scheme of the S magnitude needed in Australia j I will require the full co-operation | of all States. | 4 With the development of large I | water conservation and irriga- 1 | tion works must go a nation- | = wide fodder conservation scheme I J (which should be linked with 1 | rural electrification, soil con- I s servation and improvement and | I reafforestation. | J Money must be made avail- | able to implement the plans | j that will add to Australia's pros- ( ! perity and increase the living | | standards and social amenities I for farmers and workers. j . The Federal Liberal - Country | ! Party Government for the past | | 16 years has refused to under- s | take a national water irrigation I I and f odd jt conservation | I scheme, even though many as- j | pects of the Country Party's I = programme commits them to ( f support such a scheme. j j Let us demand in the strongest ! | possible terms support for the I | immediate commencement of a I J national plan for water con- 2 I servation and protection from | drought.
