 Consumer goods increase " jHE official statement of the results of the work of Soviet industry in the first quarter of 1965 gladdened the people's hearts, says a TASS commen tator, according to a Moscow message. It comes at a time when the hearte of British and Australian people are being . "gladdened" by tough budgets or threats of economic res- ession. The Soviet economic plan for the year envisages a rate of growth 8.1 per cent higher than last year's, with emphasis on consumer needs, says the TASS report. And this increased plan has been overfulfilled in the first three mon ths of the year. As compared with the corresponding period of last y6ar the increment in production was nine per cent. Since the past- quarter had three working days less than the first quarter of last year, the average daily production in effect went up 11 per cent. (The target set for Britain by Wil son is four per cent.) More butter The gain has been greatest in the light and food industry where it am ounts to 10 per cent. Butter improv ed by 72 per cent . on last year (which was admittedly a bad one due to drought) or by 54 per cent com pared. to 1963. Meat production has gone up and the effect of the' crop failure (caused by the 1963 drought) on stockbreed- iiig has been overcome.
