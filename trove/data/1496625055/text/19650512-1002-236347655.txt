 rSayH I Queen I yOLLONGONG: After the best May Day march in Wollongong for 30 years, Miss Suzanne Newman was . crowned the 1965 May Queen last Sunday. There were eight other en tries. About 2,500 marchers in a parade three quarters of a mile long marched through the main streets of Wollon gong in what was described as the biggest May Day march since the early 1930's. An estimated 10,000 people watched the march. As in the other May Day marches held in Australian cities the previous week, the main May Day theme called for opposition to the war in Vietnam and to Australian participation in it. Hundreds of the banners called for: Full rights for Aborigines, a Nuclear free Southern Hemisphere and a stop to the proposed French nuclear tests and for increased action in the fight to lift Australian living standards. To help the South Coast (Wollongong area) workers celebrate the occasion, dozens of Sydney trade unionists and others travelled by bus and private transport to Wollongong to participate in the march. The march ended at South Beach Reserve, where Mr. Edgar Ross, editor of the Miners' newspaper "Common Cause" spoke on the history of May Day and said that "the evidence of the march was that the message of May Day will never be destroyed".
