Brown CIGURES from only five States last week showed that the number of people who have joined the Communist Party of Australia since late January has passed 190. The Communist Jfarty's 1965 cam paign of "building towards a mass Party" is thus well on the way to over-fulfilment. The Party Building Year target is 500 new members nationally. Newcastle (N.S.W.) is still way out in front with well over 50 per cent of its target already achieved 'and still reporting regular winning of further new members. Many branches with best successes to date have worked to a plan of boldly going out to people they have worked with in local or job activity and asking him to join the Party. Reports from job, street, hall and park meetings show increased in- terest in the Communist Party's militant immediate policy for higher living standards, together with the Party's firm stand for Australia's best interests in opposing the Ameri can and Menzies Government's policies on Vietnam. Best results have been reported by those who confidently present the Party as having the only real alter native to present policies in Aus tralia of war, insecurity, higher cost of living and profiteering. Steps are already in hand, and need extending, to ensure that new members: Find an interesting part in the life of their Party organisation. Are able to attend specially arranged classes for new members. Now that the experiences of Party building are multiplying,, there is urgent need for reports of these ex periences to be made to the State and national centres, so that both the figures and the circumstances can be given publicity.
