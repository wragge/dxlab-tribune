 1 Investigation | into poverty | DOVERTY in Australia I has been recognised I by Labor leader Mr. Cal- 1 well. Consider the plight j of the civilian widow with ) no dependent children. | Her pension is a weekly i £5/7/6 apd permissible income, S £3/10/-. I If she earns more than £2, | she is allowed no medical or | transport concessions. I If she owns a block of land I and would like to build on it, | how can she save to build a 1. home as well as pay rent, food, I etc? If the land was valued at £200 several years ago, it's prob- S ably worth £800 or more now. I With increased valuations, up | go the rates and taxes but her I meagre pension remains the ! same. | This is a glaring anomaly, I but typical of many forms of | poverty among hundreds of | thousands who depend on S Federal Social Services. I f A MONG the many fatuous j articles of the how-to-catch- | your-man-and-hold-him type which appear in some women's | magazines from time to time is 1 the tip to go alone to the beach | with towel, sun-oil, books, etc., I pose becomingly and wait for | the handsome stranger to come | along. S This is dangerous advice as P nn j B|M| |||M | it conditions young girls to ac- f cept the theory of welcoming 2 attentions from a stranger, who handsome or not, could turn out 1 to be a real menace to an im- j pressionable girl. j I WHILST I admire and honour J the courage of the men of £ the "Voyager" who received j medals last week for their out- J standing bravery, few sights are | | more poignant that that of be- J I reaved relatives being handed S f the medals. I | In place of a son or husband, j | they have a medal, but there j | can be no substitute for a j | human life. I I Now, the Federal Govern- j | ment rejects the principle of | | negotiation but expands instead | jj the sending of Australians into j . battle in Vietnam. j This is the most certain way s to create more bereavement — ! - perhaps on a mass scale. j » The convention to he held in j Canberra, May 17-20, around S the theme of peace and pro- j gress through international co- 2 operation, rated exactly one 2 inch in the daily press. S Associated with the United | | Nations 1965 International Co- j f operation Year, it has an offi- j f cial status which suggests it J 1 will not really tackle the big | issues such as Vietnam— but the | | press "blanket" is significant. \ I — Mary
