 A maanificent 'Hamlet' "THE new Soviet film of "Ham let" is a splendid produc tion by Grigori Kozintsev, who is remembered for his "Don Quixote". It is the finest film version of "HAMLET" ever made. Photographed in black and white wide-screen, the film is kept at a consistent level of pictorial magni ficence. The settings, the images, the words and the characters are — however, more than in any other production we have seen — only a background for the central figure, who— as a man in a society — is dominant. Innokenti Smoktunovsky's perform ance emphasises the human character of Hamlet rather . than his heroic status. He is four-square, strong and direct. The acting of Smoktunovsky is matched by the other players. They are the people as created by Shake speare. In particular, Michel Nazwanov as Claudius and Anastasia Vertinskaya as Ophelia. Yuri Tolubeyev as Polonius is r.- doddering old fool. He is a shrewd thinking politician, a fitting compan ion to his king. Purists may quibble at the excisions in the script hut it must be remem bered that this is a film, not a photo graphed stage play. Kozintsev's imagination catches fire and he sends his figures hurtling across the screen with true Shake spearean energy. Laertes' irruption into the castle on the news of his father's death brings in his wake what seems half the population of Denmark. This adds up to a real re-creation of the primitive l| pulse of Elizabethan revenge; and a | similar authentic rhythm infects Ham- g let's killing of the king. I He leaps across the room, thrusts | his sword in like a javelin, and sends E Claudius teetering through the castle, Kj bellowing like a bull. B At such moments, and at many f| other points in this rich film, Kozint- j| sev clutches the real thing. 4 "HAMLET" is now screening for a 1 limited season at the Savoy Theatre. || Tin nnt. miss it.
