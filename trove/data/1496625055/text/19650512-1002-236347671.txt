 . Advancing steps A NUMBER of interesting advances have been made by the Miscellaneous Work ers in the field of women's oav. Mr. R. Gietzelt, Federal Secretary, said that women members working v -in Government instrumentalities '-"aners in schools etc.) have equal margins under the State Award, and while retaining the female base rate they are paid 40 hours pay for 33 hours' work. In the Linoleum and Asbestos Cement Industries they get 90 per cent of the male rate; at Michael Nairn's Aust., for example, girls manufacturing plastic tiles and linoleum get 90 per cent of the male rate of pay for the job; this also applies to women making brake linings at James Hardies Pty. Ltd. Women cleaners get 1/- less than equal margins, they also get a . loading the men don't get, working 36 hours as against 40 hours for the men. In Victoria women get 100 per cent of the male basic. rate plus -x margin, which gives them very close to equal payâ€” there is a dif ference of about 6d. an hour. In the paint industry, women get equal margins less 1/- (the men get 61/- margin and the women 60/ ). ; Equal margins also apply in sugar bag making.
