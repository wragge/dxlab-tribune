 [?] Â£HANNEL 2 has started .a new British serial called The Sleeper (Sundays at 7.30 pm). It is another spy story about "red agents". The script is childish and laughable but we must wonder why the ABC is screening such stories more fre quently during, recent weeks. If the ABC wishes to establish good i cultural relations with the socialist countries it would be well advised to "drop rubbish like The Sleeper. The three commercial channels are battling hard for the attention of viewers. There is a limited number of prestige shows available and these have been bought by Channels 7, 9 and 2. The late-comer, Channel 10, has been forced to rely on movies as its staple entertainment. Some of these have been worth viewing, e.g. Anna Lucas- ta (last Saturday at 9.30 p.m.). The other channels screen films at the same time but it is worth while check ing on the offering from 10. (Also there are fewer breaks for adverts). Good news is the return of Dawn Lake in Here's Dawn. Last year this Australian comedy series became one of the highly rated shows of TV. The opening date is next Monday ( 17th May ) on Channel 9.
