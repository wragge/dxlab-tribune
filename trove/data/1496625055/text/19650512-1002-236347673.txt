 Could he working 35-hr week DELAIDE: A report pre pared by Mr. J. Goss, of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, clearly shows why the Electricity Trust of SA can give its workers a 35 -hour week. The leport was compiled for the Trades and Labor Council as part of the campaign of the Australian Council of Trade Unions for a 35 hour week initially in the mining and power industries. A survey has shown that the trust's kilowatt— hour production between 1958 and 1963 had increased by 50%, interest payments on loans by 56%. the total wage bill by 39%, the av erage take-home pay of each employee by 26%, and the number of employees by 9%. Wages were a continuously dim. inishing portion of the annual cost of power generation because the wages bill expanded at a slower pace than the trust's income. On the basis of the facts quoted, the ti'ust could continue as a prof itable undertaking and engage a greater number of employees with each man working fewer hours with out loss of pay. The trust did not have great dif- iiculty in obtaining ' labor and it was not unreal to suggest that the labour force should be increased to make shorter hours possible. According to Mr. Goss the trust could if necessary, introduce the 35 ' hour week in stages — by an hour per week each year for five years. This then would not affect the continuing expansion of electricity undertakings Mr, Goss went on to say that if the interest rate on lean , capital were reduced by only 1% and if the tariff charges for heavy industrial consum. ption were increased by 10% it would be possible to introduce the 35 hour Week even more quickly.
