 Despoiled humanity j|N the cause of fanatical anti-com munism, and with all the dirty means at hand, the Americans, who are morally out of bounds in Viet- Nam, are slaughtering and. maiming the indigenous inhabitants. If America had adhered to the Gen eva Agreement of 1954 -on Viet Nam the situation would have been resolved long ago. The new South Vietnam party, guid ed by the Viet Cong element (who are not all communist anyhow) would have consolidated the peace and unity of both North and South, developed the economy and established educa tional institutions throughout the country, the Viet Cong having proved itself the most versatile, dedicated, intensely patriotic and uncorruptible section of these people. Surely 'something must be done to stop this diabolical slaughter. Yet I witness a section of Australians ap plauding it. Would America do this to a white race? Must these people suffer then, on account of their coloured skin! J. D. Nelson (Asquith, NSW).
