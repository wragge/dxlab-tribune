 Gov. -General If I were asked whether we should have an Australian or English future Governor-General, following the departure of De Lisle last week, I would say he certainly must be Aus- tralian. Why not someone like Harold Blair, a real Aussie who understands the country, his own Aboriginal peo ple and also is very- tolerant toward the white Aussie, as he married one. â€” R.K.
