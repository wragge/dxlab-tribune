 p' .-r- b g | 8 CONGRATULATIONS on your excellent publication! Your honest exposures of U.S. atrocities in Vietnam is to be highly com mended. My only regret is that your paper's circulation is not greater. It is appalling that in our so-called Democratic society, the general pub lic must subject itself to the subtle brainwashing of our daily morning and evening trash. I would like to consider the rea sons for the moderate public res ponse to this fine newspaper. One obvious reason is ignorance, which therefore calls for increased advertising. Yet I feel a more com plex reason is involved Over the years, the reactionary Menzies Government has succeeded (via the popular press) in brain washing the public with regard to the word "Communism". The latter has effectively been associated with terror, violence, cruelty and blood shed. The average layman thus views Communism in much the same way as he views Nazism i.e. something vile, wicked and menacing — some thing to be avoided. Naturally he is kept ignorant of the true meaning and aims of Cojm - munism; he is in effect biased against -something about which he knows nothing! Consequently, he is fearful of any publication which is even remotely associated with Com munism. Thus I feel it is essential to educ ate the public with regard to the . meaning of Communism in order that it may view the term in a real istic and unemotional light — and NOT in the distorted, obscene vein as formulated by ' Menzies, Went- worth etc. -20-year-old Student, Sydney University.
