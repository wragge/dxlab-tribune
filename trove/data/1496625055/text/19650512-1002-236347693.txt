It upholds and supports the I United Nations Declaration of | the Rights of the Child, adopted | by the General Assembly on I November 20th, 1959. The objectives of the day are ! to popularise the United Nations | Declaration on children and to build closer contact between chil- > .dren all over the world. f LONG BATTLE | | Behind International Children's g Day is the story "of a long battle f to . establish the rights of chil- | dren throughout the world. j In 1952, representatives of g Women's organisations of more | than 70 nations met at a confer- I ence in Vienna designed to plead g for the rights of children every- ! where. | s It took nine years before the g United Nations drew up and rati- | fied a charter which, -at the urgent | request of the women of the j ' world, guaranteed the rights of I children. ! It was adopted unanimously by j the United Nations in 1959. i Some points in the Charter are: j All children of all races are g protected by the charter. ! All children are under the | special protection of the law. g Every child is entitled to a £ name and nationality. 8 ® Special pre-natal care, social security and housing . should g cover the needs of children. i This relates to the needs of | mentally and physically handi- | , capped children. | Children should never be sep- = arated from the love and un- j =derstanding of their families g and orphans must be brought under loving care of the ap- g propriate authorities. g Education should be free and = compulsory so that children g should grow up to be respon- g sible members of society. g Relates to the responsibility 1 of children coming first in the j disoensation of protection and g relief. 8 Children must be protected ) . from neglect, cruelty and ex- g ploitation and there should be = no traffic in children's lives. I Children should be protected j against all social, religious g and racial discrimination. s The tenth point has been cho- | sen as the theme of International | Childrens Day celebrations this j year and it is this theme of her' ? ance that runs through the films, g the commentaries and the# art s competition held in Australia. x "International Children's Pa>' ! reminds us all that the carefree g childhood we take for granted g something that is being chal- ! lenged by war, disease and famine | somewhere in the World, every j single day of every single ywr, ? wrote Sally Richards in the Mel- J bourne 'Age' last year."
