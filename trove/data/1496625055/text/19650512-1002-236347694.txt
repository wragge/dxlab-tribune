 Child care is the\ test of a Society A SURVEY the Union I of Australian Women i made of child-care faci- 1 lities for working j mothers reveals the fol- ! lowing : — j The Child Protection Society ! operates the only "Government" | child minding centre in the State, | in Perth. The Government pro- | vides a small subsidy— a pepper- | corn rental of £1 a year and all j equipment paid for. j It is primarily for working | mothers, opening at 7.30 a.m., S but it also does child minding I for mothers with appointments " to keep. Rates are 25/- week, or | a flat rate of 5/- a day. Its capa- | city is 75 children. | There are seven privately I owned nurseries, taking 115 chip I dren.- Fees range from £2.10.0 to | £3.10.0 a week.- All centres car- | ing for three or more children I must be registered for" inspection. I Women's organisations, led | by the Union of Australian Wom- i en, have been successful in hav- | ing a creche included in the blue- | prints of the new civic centre "for | Fremantle. | Store subsidy | By June, 1965, there will be S 72 kindergartens affiliated to the I Kindergarten Union, accommq- j dating 3,500 children— about 7% | of pre-school children. Fees j range from 12/- to £1. There are ! long waiting lists for entry. ! Three after-school child- ) minding centres for 6-12 year olds j now operate in the suburbs of 1 Perth and Fremantle, with three I more opening by the end of May. j These are solely subsidised by I the well-known chain store pro- I prietor, Tom Wardell (trading as | Tom's Stores). | The subsidy provides a hot or | cold snack for children, a kitchen I worker and play equipment. I The centres operate at schools, j where a room is provided for | use on the understanding that a I teacher is present for supervi- | sion. These centres are under the j control of the Council of Social S Service of W.A.; they are open | from 3.30 to 6 p.m. and only chil- | dren of mothers working because S of economic necessity (i.e. "not I so as to keep up with the j Joneses") are admitted w.ith | widows and widowers getting I first priority. The limit of each | centre is 30 children. 8 | Women who | support | children ! CYDNEY: Clerks' Union j assistant- secretary Mr. j V. Higgins, spoke of the | plight of women workers i who support families, in a ! phone interview with Tri- | bune. j "There is an enormous num- | ber of women members of the I union who support children," he said, "and they aren't get- jj ting recognition. I "Although the male basic 8 wage is looked at on the basis | of it being a family wage (it isn't adequate, but that's the | idea), a woman's is not. ! "Whether she is working for j her own support or for ten g children, a woman is not recog- g nised as a breadwinner; the j man gets what is supposed to j be a family wage, whether he | single or a father of ten. I "The equal pay legislation is | all very well as rar as it goes; 1 bjit it doesn't assist the majo- I rity of working women, and for | a union such as the Clerks' it 1 will be necessary for the legisla- | tion to be amended. | "That is one problem; the ! A.C.T.U. has a policy of try- J ing to push the Commonwealth | Government into doing some- j thing for their own employees," j he said. I Equal margins j Mr. Higgins continued: "Our j specific contribution to the | equal pay campaign has been j to avoid the complications of j both these problems, and work I on the question of equal mar- J gins; for example, the brewery j clerks' new Federal award is a I success for the first time in a j Federal award gaining equal j margins for male and female. | This gave £1 to £1/10/- above | the Federal standard for female 8 employees. | The Commonwealh Govern- j ment may not do anything for j donkey's years for their own | employees; the interpretation 8 that the Industrial Commission I have placed on the Exclusion j Clause would mean that our fe- j male members doing what is 1 considered to be 'female work' | under the present legislation j would never get equal pay. v j "It is union policy to do all j it can to implement the I.L.O. 1 Convention on Equal Pay." | Mr. Higgins said that one I difficulty seemed to he to get j female and male employees to J understand that the attainment | of equal pay is in the interests | of both of them. i Men sometimes say "Why j should a girl get the same wage I as I do," some women feel | that if they attain the male rate | they won't be employed. | But simple figures show that g there aren't enough to fill the | positions at the present time.' |
