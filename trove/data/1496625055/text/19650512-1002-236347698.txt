 lit doesn't happen | ; very often i f SYDNEY: It Ss not often that you can I ( meet a woman union steward in a metal j S shop ... but at MaSIeys Ltd., at Auburn, j j in Sydeny, there are four. \ J "THIS shop is one of the ! few in Australia where I women receive the male J award rate of pay. . ( | Of the 600 workers at this I factory (making washing mac- ! hines, fridges, heaters, etc.) over 1 40 per cent are women. 1 Sheet Metal Workers' Union. | delegates Norma Wilton, Joan I Wildig, Daphne Langly and Lyn 1 Hardy all gave convincing rea- j sons why women are entitled to | equal pay. | "When women are working | side by side with the men, do- I ing the same work, they should I be entitled to equal pay," they Q said. 1 Although the women at this | factory get the award male | rate which is £17/6/-, they do | not receive equal pay. I Because of over award pay- I ments, the average wage paid j for a male process worker at g the plant is £20/5/- a week. j The women are not too happy j about not receiving the over j award rate.- g They said that the manage- | ment had been approached on j numerous occasions to give tlie g male rate to women on certain g jobs, but the answer has al- I ways been no. | Equal pay was first intro- g | duced at the company's Alexan- 1 j dria factory during the war | | years in 1943. | | At that time company spokes- g j men admitted that women S | were even better than men on f | some processing jobs. | | All-rounder j I Mrs. Wilton (seven years as a j I delegate) said sne was' an "all g I rounder" ! | From time to time she does | g oxy-acetylene brazing, for which g | she gets paid 11/- extra. r g | Some women do welding all I the time, she said. | ! - Mrs. Wilding (a delegate for j I six months) makes defrost trays j ifor fridges. I Mrs. Langley (four months a j delegate) assembles evaporators, g does pop riveting, etc. | | Mrs. Hardey (six months a j I delegate) works on the fridge | I line assembly units, and so on. | g All are married, as are most | I of the women who work in- the j | factory. " « g They all agreed that "even ! ! the men's wages were poor." j 1 At the moment the combined | I union committee on the job is g j pressing for a general wage in- j S crease of £2 a week for trades- j I men and £1 for every other j | worker. g i "The basic wage should be | g nothing less than £22 a week. i Even on this a family could not | | live if it was the only wage j g coming in," they. said. . . j g "Too right we support the ! I trade union— we would get no- j I where without it;" they said. j
