 OTHER I NEEDS ! gQUAL pay is an urgent j . . need for women work- j ers — but it is not their j only need. Many married women , while j badly needing additional income ! are prevented by family responsi- | bilities from working full time. j There is only a limited amount j of part-time work available, it is poorly paid, it has little perman ency and does not carry adequate holiday rights. In these circumstances many married women, obliged to in crease their family's income with ' full time work, are . burdened with a host of additional difficul ties. These include: inadequate and costly child-care arrangements; shopping difficulties; lost time due to family illnesses or added worry when time cannot be taken .off to cope with these. These and many similar prob lems were the subject of discus- ' sion and decisions at two impor tant gatherings last year — one or ganised by the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) and the other by the International Labor Organisation (ILO). Australian unions had repres entatives at both of these gather ings. The need now is for the Aus tralian trade unions to extend their campaign for equal pay to include other demands of im portance to women workers. t
