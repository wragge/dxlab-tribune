 Woman union | official | for 25 years j kAISS FLO DAVIS (pic- j tured), asistant secre- j tary of the Liquor Trades j Union, has been a trade | union organiser for more i than 25 years. j She was secretary of the Hotel j Club and Restaurant Union for j sixteen years, and has .held her I present position since the amal- j gamation of these two unions. In = all that time, she has been striv- J ing for equal pay for women j .workers, and Miss Davis has ; attended the Council" for Action i on Equal Pay from 1937, when | she was working in the industry j as a waitress. -&lt;> | Miss Davis said that while g there lias been good headway ! made by the teachers t and some | shop assistants and others, and I some women achieved equal pay S on January 1, 1963, thousands of | women workers outside the pro- I . visions of the Act in factories = and utility industries such as I hotels, restaurants and clubs are g still on mainly 75% of the male g base rate with a margin for skill, j a female bar attendant gets g , £14.19.0 a week, a male £18.18.0, I the difference is £3.19.0 a week g and the work is exactly the same; j no longer can it even be said ? that men are called on to put I on the kegs because this is usu- | ally the job .-of the cellarman. s It is true that the union has . been able to get equal pay for I ; cooks in hotels and clubs, but | I female cooks in other sections of s I the industry are still on £3.4.0 1 ! less pay than the male. This j ' leaves ah army of waitresses, j I pantrymaids, kitchenmaids, shop j assistants and factory workers of j all kinds without equal pay. g I The Female nates Act of e j N.S.W. which opened the way I I for unions to win equal pay has | I two clauses which virtually close g I the door for union applications; I j one is that the Union must prove j L equal work under equal condi- g 1 tions with the male worker, this ® | is practically impossible, as the | 2 Hospital Employees' Union found g I trying to get an equal rate for = I kitchenmaids. | I It was shown that the men | I handled the garbage tins, the g J women usually didn't. S | In actual practice they usually S | do in many restaurants where g I .there. is no male employee what- g | soever, two females handle the | | garbage tin when the union pro- s teats it is. too heavy for one. The g I Shops and Factories Act limits = I the weight to be carried by a g ,g female to 35 pounds. | | The other barrier is that the g g Act sets down that where the in- „ idustry is predominantly female, \ a union has no right to apply ir | j equal rates. j | This is true of many industries J g — textile, clothing, rubber, book, | I electrical and other manufactur- g I ing where the main basis of pro- = j duction is female labour. I | In addition of course, there are j J the utility industries, hotels and j j so on. |
