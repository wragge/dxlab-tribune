 [?] Folk singing on TEN UOOTENANNY (Channel 10, 5.30 pm, Saturdays) is a good entertaining hour, featur- ina folk sonas and other popu- lar items. A wide variety of artists is heard each week and the show is staged at different universi ties in the United States. The stage is placed in the centre of a huge audience of students and the artists make immediate; contact with ' the young people. Hootenanny is a bright and fast-moving show that could serve as a model for similar local TV productions. . if T7" E V I N SANDE R S PRESENTS (Channel 9, Fridays at 9.30, p.m.) has improved in recent weeks. It is a selection of items from In Mel bourne Tonight. Last week's show was excellent entertainment. The highlight was a performance by Rolf Harris. What a wonderful artist he is. Sydney TV ignored him while he was here. $ ' :I: & PANORAMA (Channel 2, Sundays at 3.30 p.m.) is a BBC news maga zine well worth viewing. Last week there was an excellent coverage by Michael Charlton of demonstrations by the students of Yale University against American policy in South Vietnam. It is clear that many Ame ricans are opposed to the use of their troops in this area. The Samurai,, a Japanese series, returns to Channel 9 . next Mon day (May 24) at 5.30 p.ra. These are exciting stories and the action and production very good. The voices .are dubbed by Americans, but this is no deterrent to enjoying the films. â€” Eileen Allison
