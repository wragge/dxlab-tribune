 £22 a week is a minimum living wage By L. J. McPHILLIPS SYDNEY: A basic wage of £2 a week would be a reasonable demand in today's conditions, for a minimum family living wage. A FULL family living wage as a oasic wage is a just ana legitimate demand of Austra lian workers. It has heen a demand 01 tne aojlu for the past twenty years. Sixteen years ago the ACTU asked the Arbitration - Court to fix such a wage. Despite all this the family living wage claim remains one more unsatis fied demand. Research and other forms of inves tigation will assist to determine the sum of money needed to meet this demand. The unions can support the claim by well-based argument. But unless the demand is backed by united mass actions of the workers it will remain unsatisfied. Campaigning . in support of this claim does not have to await final fixing of the amount involved. A starting point for such a cam paign could be the unsatisfied demand made for a family living wage in 1949. The amount claimed then was £10. A comparable claim today would be approximately £22. The claim now. awaiting decision by the Arbitration Commission is for a basic wage of £16 for the six Capital Cities average. Clearly this is not a family living wage and was not fixed as such.. In these circumstances; £22 is not an exaggerated figure to advance as the minimum needed. This sum has already been advanced by the Building Workers' Industrial Union (BWIU) as the minimum needed to meet the ACTU claim. Other unions which have already adopted this sum as the minimum amount needed include the Boiler makers, AEU, ARU and sections of. the Waterside Workers' Federation. A recent conference of metal trades job delegates convened by the Metal Trades Federation . in . Victoria also adopted this claim. A campaign in support of this de mand has already commenced. The need now is to develop this into a nation-wide movement.
