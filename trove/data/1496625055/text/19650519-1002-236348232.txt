 Leningrad wedding A round of applause broke out as the Australian May Day Delegation visiting Leningrad presented suitable gifts to the bride and groom at the ceremony then taking place when they attended the Palace of Mar- riages in Leningrad. The happy couple had entered the marriage room to the music of Chaikovsky's Concerto for Two and were married, by an official in a short ceremony. As is the custom, a deputy of the local council congratulated the pair. The ceremony costs 1 rouble 50 kopecks (about 15/-) and about 50 couples are married each day. The Palace contains a reception hall, and all the requisites for the occasion, flowers, presents, etc., can be purchased at special shops on the premises. The Leningrad Palace of Marriage was opened on May 2, 1955, on the initiative of the young people of that city and this gave those couples who wished to have a more colour ful wedding than was offered by the registry office the facilities to do so.â€” Bill Sutton, with Australian May Day Delegation, Leningrad.
