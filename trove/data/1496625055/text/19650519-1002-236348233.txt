 "DON'T LET IT HAPPEN", SAY VIETNAMESE Reluctance of the South Vietnam puppet troops to fight for fheir "own" government is an obvious reason why US, and later Australian troops, were scheduled to be sent. rpiME magazine of April 30 records mat "as tnree oawanons oi quulii Vietnamese infantry pushed towards Viet An, an outpost 31 miles south of Da Nang, they passed a sign erected by the Communist Viet Cong. It read: "A 250,000-man French Expeditionary corps came this way and was destroyed. Don't let it hap pen to you." "They didn't," says Time, adding that as soon as the liberation forces opened fire, the South Vietnamese broke and ran. According to Manchester Guardian correspondent Clare Hollingworth, re- quoted by The Australian on April 28, "South Vietnamese soldiers, never eager for a scrap, are becoming in creasingly reluctant to get involved in the war at all." Some units, says Miss Hollingworth, are "good men and reasonably well trained," but they are only 30,000 out of an army of 270,000. Quoting reasons given by senior Vietnamese officers for the troops' "obvious desire not to get involved in the fighting" she said the Vietnamese sense the war is increasingly becom ing an American show. "They feel their blood and soil are being used for world issues which don't interest them." At one training, post for recruits she visited there had been over 50 per cent, of desertions.
