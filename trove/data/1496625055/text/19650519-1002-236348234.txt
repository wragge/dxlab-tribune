 Recall troops Describing the decision to send Australian troops to Vietnam as a "tragic blunder," the Rev. Alan Walk er, superintendent of Sydney's Cen- tral Methodist Mission, said: "The idea that nations can pro tect their own shores by turning other people's lands and villages into a battlefield is a dangerous relic of imperialism. It is a concept no Christian can accept." Another speaker who objected to the sending of the troops was the independent Senator from Tasmania, Senator Turribull, on his recent re turn from Asia, where he had also spoken out against this dangerous policy. The decision by the Menzies Gov ernment must alienate opinion in all Asiatic countries except those controlled by U.S. puppets, and is likely to have far-reaching and ap palling consequences for Australia. Australian troops must not go to Vietnam! â€” K. Ross (Sydney).
