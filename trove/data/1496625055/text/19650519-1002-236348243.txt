 Lib. who voted yes j i didn't have a clue I ADELAIDE: Just why did Liberal Party Member for j j ' Wakefield (SA) in the House of Representatives (Mr. C. J j I R. Kelly) support the Menzies Government's decision to j j send Australian troops to Vietnam? | I VET when Mr. Kelly met a deputation of citi zens who protested against the Government's action, j he - â€” . j 9 Admitted that South Viet- ! nom Governments were corrupt. I Admitted there was a lot of j truth in the assertion that the ! USA knew about Australia's for- eign policy moves before the Aus- j tralian people did. I Didn't know who was the j Premier of South Vietnam, j O Didn't know about the Gen- j eva Conference decision that I elections were to be held in 1956 | to establish a democratic .all- j Vietnam Government. O Didn't know that the line j between North and South Viet- !nam was a provisional line pend ing such elections. I 9 Didn't know the Viet Cong (controlled three quarters of South Vietnam. | Yet based on all this "know- ledge" he is prepared to gamble ! with Australian lives. I When it was pointed out that j the United Nations had been by- j passed he said the reason was | that a decision would take too | long and would probably be nega- ! tive because most nations would- I not know much about what was I going on in the world. ! His allegation about the ignor- ( ance of the nations was most in- j teresting in view of his own rather inadequate understanding | of what Vietnam is all about. | The leader of the deputation to Mr. Kelly was Mr. Brian Rooney, j member of the Adelaide District | Committee of the Amalgamated | Engineering Union and member j of the Communist Party. Mr. I Rooney lives in Mr. Kelly's elec- j torate. | Other activity on Vietnam con- | tinues in SA. Workers at the I Waterworks, Kent Town, have j signed a petition opposing the j use of Australian troops. I _ _ j
