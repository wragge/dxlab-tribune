 SA Labor Govt handout to Mr Big ADELAIDE: The Broken Hill Associated Smelters is to be supplied with cheap electri city for its production of re- fined zinc from" the Port Pine slag dump. Electricity Trust administration manager (Mr. S. E. Huddleston) announced that the Trust would supply 150 million kilowatt hours of power annually. This wpuld be three times the present annual power con sumption of any other single con sumer. The Premier (Mr. Walsh) has de clared the industry to be an "approved industry" for the purposes of the Electricity Supply (Industries) Act. This means that power Will be sup plied at cheap rates. A Communist Party spokesman said this week that the CPA does not agree that a wealthy company like BHAS should receive such privileged treat ment The use of public utilities such as che Electricity Trust to aid monopoly was a feature of the Playford Liberal administration. Any proposition by the new Labor administration to reverse this practice and, in this particular instance, to make the BHAS pay handsomely for power supplies would be well received by the working people of South Aus tralia. The Communist Party considers that the BHAS can afford this and it would bring benefit to the Government and the people. It considers that such policy in which the rich must pay should be followed by the public ownership of BHAS and other big concerns.
