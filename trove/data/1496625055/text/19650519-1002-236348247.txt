 i : : ; : II 9 yV| i Race to the moon j j From RUPERT LOCKWOOD MOSCOW: The suc- | cess of the automatic soft | landing probe by Luna 5 I means that Soviet cosmo- Inauts are likely to set foot on the moon well ahead of the Americans. Cosmonaut Gherman Titov | said of Luna 5's moon landing: I 'This is an important land- mark in the development of Soviet space technology. The mastering of soft landing methods brings us closer to the day when we shall be able to send a man to the moon." The President of the Academy of Sciences, Mstislav Keldysh, pointed out that, .due to the lack of atmos phere, the braking of the craft by atmospheric resistance and a para chuting system was precluded. The speed of about 2,300 metres per second at which the craft would hit the moon had to be slowed by 1 retro-rockets from comparatively |jj small altitudes above the moon's p| surface and end precisely at the moon's surface, otherwise it would | crash. -|| While recognising that further soft ;| landing problems remain to be M solved, Keldysh said, Luna 5's flight fl gave the opportunity to conduct a | most detailed study of the moon's | surface.
