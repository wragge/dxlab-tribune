 I lit Darwin's ! May Day S r\ARVVIN: Highlight of Darwin's j | May Day parade again this j | year was the participation of : ? Aboriginal Workers and their j J families. (Picture below.) | !They had prepared and carried j a great many placards and ban- j Iners. j Some urged improved educa- j tion for their children, training j | and opportunity for adult ! II workers; ! A flbat drew attention to the f disrespect shown by the R.A.A.F. j I for the sacred burial ground on j Quail Island, which is regularly | being used for bombing practice. J i However, the emphasis was on 1 the vital issue for Aboriginal j workers, equal pay. ! A heartwarming feature of the I parade was a group of boys and | girls, Aboriginal and white, who j marched . hand in hand with ! I sandwich boards bearing the I j words of the now famous song, j II "We Shall Overcome." ! Here in the Territory a new I verse has been added to this I song and a small Aboriginal boy j wore a confident grin along with | his hoard, which said "We'll get I equal pavÂ»" |
