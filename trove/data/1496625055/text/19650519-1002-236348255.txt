 [?] -HE Big Crush is the apt title given by Pete Thomas to his rev ealing story of Australia's old- est monopoly — - the Col onial Sugar Refining Company. " Founded by Edward Knox some 110 years ago, with a modest .capital 'of-- £1 50,000 the CSR had amassed assets exceeding £1 10 million by 1961.. . . In its first year of operations, C.S.R. returned a dividend of 50 per cent and paid out £75,000 to shareholders. Subsequent dividends down through the years maintained their sweetness. The 1964 dividend was 12 1 per cent, only one-quartier of the 1956 rate, but the pay-out was £3 mil lion, or forty times the 1856 amount. The C.S.R. has just - about the most liberally watered capital struc ture of any public company in Australia. Pete Thomas shows that up to 1940 C.S;R shareholders had sub- cribed £2,425,000 in cash to the com pany. J. . They, received free of ' charge bonus shares to the value of- £13,175,000. This brought the company's nominal paid-up capital to £15,600,000, . However, in the 1920's, share- . holders had returned to them in cash £3,900,000, which reduced the "paid-up capital" to £11,700,000. Not one penny of this £11,700,000 any longer represented capital paid-up by shareholders, although it still continued to figure as such in the company's books of ac count. This is. just one of the many false pretences, countenanced by capita list company law, whereby mono polies cover up their exorbitant profits, v " The C.S.R.'s fictitious capital of £11,700,000 in 1940 became the basis for further free bonus issues on which fat dividends continued to be paid. In the last three years C.S.R.'s net profit figures have reached their most spectacular levels — £3,0 mil- . lion, £4.5 million and £7.3 million, a total of just on £15 million for three, years. Pete Thomas turns the : spotlight on rich , families who Control C.S.R., the Knoxs, Bucklands,. Mac- - Carthur Onslows, Fairfaxes, Faith- . fulls, Horderns and others,; and re veals their connections with other key sectors of the Australian economy/; Pete Thomas also lays bare the . most shameful chapter in C.S.R.'s 110 years history— the monstrous trade in Kanaka laborers. C.S.R.'s colonial exploitation of Fiji is also dealt .with most thoroughly. Pete Thomas exposes how the C.S.R. sugar monopoly is buttres sed and upheld by the Common wealth , and State Government of Queensland. C.S.R.'s vast wealth is built on exploitation of cane-growers, farm, mill and refinery workers and con sumers alike. In 1960, when growers were com pelled to plough in thousarids of tons of cane because of "over-pro duction", the C.S.R., with govern ment sanction, increased the price of sugar by Id. lb. Since 1960, by introducing bulk handling of raw suga-r, CSR has drastically reduced its costs, but there has been no move to lower the domestic price for sugar.
