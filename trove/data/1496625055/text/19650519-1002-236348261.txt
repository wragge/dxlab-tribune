 [?] I Chelsea offers 1 1 S i lessons to us j ! I By "The Challenger" j r | ""HE visiting Chelsea I soccer team has I sHown the Australian public how first class J soccer is really played. j From the series', so far, ' it has become obvious that !! Australia has guite a long way to go before it is con sidered to be in the big league. Chelsea manager Tommy Doc-, herty, in a TV interview, said, I "The 5-0 win over N.S.W. was I no indication of N.S.W.'s true | form," said Docherty, "as Chel- S sea had beaten such teams as J Everton 4-0 and Liverpool 5-1." I To raise the standard of Aus- I tralian Soccer Docherty said that ! "money should be spent on de veloping top coaches, not on has-been players." J The youth in particular should j be ''"'catered for and young I coaches should be sent to Eng- ! land and Europe to learn and to I get experience." Helped Russia j British football had an import- j ant influence on Russian foot- | ball and as far back as the be- | ginning of the century, and ap- 1 parently helped the Russians i develop their game on a sound base. Andrei Starostin, one of the best half-backs in the Soviet Union during the 1930's, says in a pamphlet "Soviet Football": "The first generation of Rus sian footballers played the game according to British rules. ? Britain's influence on the de- I velopment of the sport in Rus- I sia reveals itself, for one thing, I thorough Russian soccer tetfmi- S nology. I "Such words as 'hands Y 'peri- | alty, 'corner' and 'offside' be- I came part of the Russian foot- ! ball lexicon." | He adds that British players | joined Russian teams at the be- 8 ginning of the century, i "A Russian manufacturer, | Savva Morozov, advertised in British newspapers that the j 1 Orekhovo-Zuyevo Textile Mills ! were in need of engineers, mech- I r anics, and clerks "capable of | » playing footwell well. j f "British players— the Charnock brothers, Greenwood, McDonald j and. Tomlinson — joined the | team of the Orekhovo Sports | Club, organised by the Morozov ! Mills. .1. This Morozov j team was dubbed by the fans the "Terror of Moscow". ". . . Another member of the Moscow League during those years was the British Sports Club, organised in Moscow but &lt; consisting only of British foot ball players." Today there is little doubt as | to the high position that Rus- 1 sian football holds in world 1 soccer. a With a sensible approach to '' the devolpment of . talent as out- ! lined by Tommy Docherty, I Australian soccer could within i a very short time develop first- | division teams. j > Sydney League i I P k By Jim Sharrock j ' rpHE Match of the Day be- | i tween South Sydney and I North Sydney was a "real I S thriller." Before the match j 1 . Norths! were the favourites fol- j k lowing . their win over the | mighty Saints, but football j 1 teams, like horses,, don't always j I run true to form; ! 1 Souths . had a slight edge on j | Norths from the very begin- , j 'J ning. This was due to their. J ;| superior speed in all depart- J 1 merits (and the weather and | conditions of the ground suited i speed). Souths in attack gave j the ball plenty of "air" and j moved it from the base of the j scrum in quick style. In de- ? fence- they- were there to block I Norths from getting a real go J on. ; Due to this Norths were j . ! . unable to get their wingers | moving into action. | . Nb'rths, in spite of Souths' | , superiority on the day, did very I fine "work, and . it was far. from j being a one-sided game. j i : Like? the Norths v. Saints j. j ! game, play it again to-morrow | J and you get a different result. | % This is very good for football. ? The scores: Souths, three I | j tries five goals, 19 points; I | j Norths, three tries- four goals, . | ! 17 points. | | On the day Souths deserved j | their narrow win. I never j | heard one "hillite" asking for j ;y: ; j | I . :In "Tribune" on May 5 I j 1 raised the question of amateur » £i athletics being run during the | B i interval breaks at Rugby | -E | League games at Sydney | E j Cricket ground.
