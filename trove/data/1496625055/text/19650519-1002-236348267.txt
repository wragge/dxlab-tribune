 [?] With Tribune's Industrial Roundsman. CTORIES in last week's Syd- ney press about unmarried mothers being exploited as "domestics" expose the hypo critical morality bred by capit alism. Picture those well-to-do, "nice people" handing out "charity" . which r uires these girls to work about 15 hours a day, seven days a week, for £3. The greatest form of immorality is the exploitation of a, fellow human being . '. . but this is a virtue under capitalism. Australia will soon : be , going over to decimal currency. The changeover has been speeded up on some . items. Already the Australian Government is converting Australian; troops into dollars: ; . !v/;V Prime Minister Menzies last week banned members , of the Australian Parliament from reading the corre spondence between the Governments ©f Australia and South Vietnam on the ' sending of Australian . combat troops to Vietnam. The decision had been made through normal diplomatic channels and he had "no intention of tabling the details." . Labor interjector: "Why not?" Sir Robert angrily: "You can bark as loud as yoii like, bceause I know you are opposed to the decision." ? . A delegate from the Hospital Em ployees' Union was the only one who opposed the ACTU executive decision against sending Australian troops to Vietnam when discussed at last week's . NSW Labor Council. Though a comparatively young man, he was not opposed to sending troops' to Vietnam . . ."but did not want to go himself," he told an interjector. . "But you want to send me," shouted a young man from the Printers' Union. O?nnteo ana published / by. O B Xouhft. 16I- Oay Street Sydney at
