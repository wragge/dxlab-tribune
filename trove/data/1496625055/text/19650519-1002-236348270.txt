 Pensioners' Conf. Federal Govt "heartless and inhuman" ADELAIDE: The Australian Commonwealth Pensi oners' Federation conference here branded as "heartless and in- human" the Menzies Govern ment's indifference to their plea for immediate pensions relief. The Government had been asked to grant Â£1 a week rise at the first 1965 session of Federal Parliament last March. Conference expressed alarm at the steep rise in the cost of living and depreciation, in the spending power of the weekly pension. The conference called on the Gov ernment to make provision in the 1965-66 budget estimates for a pen sion of not less than 50 per cent of the Federal male basic wage, with cost of living adjustments, to be made retropective to budget day. They declared as "totally inade quate" the 5/- 1964 budget rise which the Government knew was already swallowed lip in the increased cost of living. The conference made a plea for world peace through the United Nations and noted with "grave con cern the "relative depreciation of expenditure of the national revenue on social security." It called upon the Federal Govern ment to explore every avenue for peace and to fulfil its purpose as a member of U.N. O. and a signatory to the "Universal Declaration of Human Rights" which state that everyone has "the right to social security in sickness, widowhood and old age."
