 I S.A. to ' | stop | slick | selling I A DELAIDE. â€”The S.A. Labor I Government plans to Intro- f duce measures to "protect j people from high . pressure sales I tactics in the housing and bust- | ness field." ! This was announced recently I by the Attorney-General (Mr. D. | Dunstan). | Mr. Dunstan said the basis of law had been, "Let the buyer beware." He continued: "Previously, our law-makers have often taken the attitude that it is impossible to legislate to protect people who neglect their own interests. "If they fail to get advice on a transaction, it is their bad ' luck or bad management. "But in these days, when some of the large selling or ganisations have perfected pre- sure sales tactics, it would be j much more reasonable to pro- j vide some sort of consumer I protection." j Mr. Dunstan said that often, | as a result of the blandish- j ments of salesmen, young I couples bought a house which j involved high weekly repay- j ments which left little else to. | maintain a decent living stan- I dard. I The Government, however, has I not yet announced the details f of its propsed "buyer protec- ! tion" laws. I The Communist Party would I support any State legislation | which protects people from j slick sales methods. !
