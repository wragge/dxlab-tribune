 Workers rebuff L. Short KlEWCASTLE: A mass meet- ing of over 300 members of the Federated Ironworkers' Association at the State Dock- yard in Newcastle condemned a decision of the union's national conference supporting Austra lian troops to Vietnam. The dockyard ironworkers said they disassociated themselves from the decision of the national conference of the FIA which came out in support of the Menzies Government's policies in Vietnam. It was reported in the Sydney press last week that the 27 delegates to the FIA national conference were unanim- . ous for Australian military assistance against "Communists in Malaysia, India and South Vietnam." A motion said, "our survival lies mainly in our alliance with the United States and we should do all we can to cement that alliance." Reporting the decision, the Daily Telegraph said: "This brings the FIA into conflict with the Federal and State Labor Parties and big sections of the trade union movement." This is so, but as the Dockyard workers show, it is the FIA right-wing leaders who are in conflict, not the members of the Association. A telegram of protest has been sent - from the dockyard to Mr. L. Short (national secretary of the FIA). The works committee at the State Dockyard (representing about 1,500 . workers) has also unanimously con demned the Federal Government on its decision to send Australian troops to Vietnam.
