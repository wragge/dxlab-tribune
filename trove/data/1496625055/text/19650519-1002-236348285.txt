 Tin workers strike for more pay RDLETHAN (NSW): About 50 workers at the Ardlethan Tin Mines in Western NSW last Thurs day stopped work in support of a Â£5 a week site allowance. Earlier the men held a half-day strike in support of this demand. The site allowance is being sought to compensate for the difficulties en countered in working the mine,- in cluding the menace of dust. Mr. R. McNeil, Amalgamated Engin eering Union organiser, said that negotiations with the management last Thursday "were abortive." Other unions involved in the dis pute are the Boilermakers, Electrical Trades and the Australian Workers' Union. The unions are now seeking a con ference with the industrial officer of Mines and Metals.
