 Unions aid Solomon Is. workers 0RISBANE : The Building Trades Group of unions in Queensland have sent a dona tion of Â£25 to assist the Solo mon Islands workers who have been on strike for a wage of a. meagre 1 /- an hour. The donations are in response to an appeal for support and advice which has been sent by -the British Solomon Islands Building & General Workers' Union in Honiara. The Solomon Islands are a British Crown colony. The strike, by the Union's 800 members, has been in protest against a proposal by the Government to in crease wages only to 92d. an hour. The 9:d. an hour, which is the best the Government will offer, is equivalent to only 32/6 for 40 hours of work. The letter sent from Honiara is signed by the union's president (Mr. Paul Toliole) and secretary (Mr. Joel Kikolo), of Post Office Box 43, Honiara, British Solomon Islands. The Building Workers' Industrial Union and Sydney Branch of the Waterside Workers' Federation sent financial aid. The Sydney Branch of the W.W.F. has also written to Mr. F. Cousins (ex-general secretary of the British Transport Unions and now a Member of Parliament) asking for his inter vention. The federal secretary, of the Boiler makers' Society has written to Prime Minister, Mr. Wilson, asking him to intervene in support of the Solomon Islands workers.
