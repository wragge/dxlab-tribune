 ACTU demand is for 44/- | margin rise ! Rw I I MrPHILLIPS SYDNEY: A full family living wage as a basic j! wage (which today cannot be less than £22 a week) i is not the only major wage demand in the program 1 of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. An- r other is increased margins. > CURRENT ACTU policy is for the purchasing power of and relativity between margins for various classifications to be re stored to the 1947 position. The year 1947 is not chosen at ran dom. It was in 1947 that the purchasing power of the tradesman's margin measured by his basic wage rose to - the highest level on record. The value of the non-tradesman's \ margin related to that of the trades- I man also reached a record high. | In that year the margin for a fitter f was increased to 52/-, or equal to 1 48.5 per cent of the basic wage. I This was slightly more than 43 per j I cent which the: fitter's margin repre- I sented in the first metal trades award I in 1907, . I Today the margin for a base rate I tradesmen is 106/- and equal to only j 34.5 per cent of the basic wage. If this margin was restored to its : 1947 level, i.e. 48.5 per cent of the "i basic wage, it would equal 150/-. So the ACTU margins demand for base rate tradesmen under the Federal i Metal Trades Award and for all other \ classifications on a similar margin ! is at present a 44/- increase. I The margins for a great number j of non-tradesmen's, classifications j were increased to represent a greater \ I proportion of the fitter's margin than 1 was previously the case. I ,4 For example, the fitter's margin was f i increased from 36/- per week to 52/- IT while the tradesman's assistant's | A margin was increased from 12/- to ' 23/.- per week. | 3 So the relativity between the mar- ; gin for the. base rate tradesman and A\ his assistant changed from 33 1-3 per ' \ cent to 6,4 per cent. | The margin today for a trades- man's assistant is 32/6 and equals only 30.5 per cent of the trades- 3 man's margin. i) If this was restored to the 64 per I cent it represented in 1947 the trades- I man's assistant's margin today would : equal 68/-. > The ACTU, demand for trades- man's assistants and others with Isimlar margin is for a 35/6 per week ; increase. ' Comparatively speaking, the in crease being sought for non-trades- men is greater than for tradesmen, g ' Since 1947 the margins for non- j tradesmen have slipped back further -| than margins for tradesmen.. I For example, the tradesmen's mar- J gin. today equals 34.5 per cent of ,| the basic wage as against 48.5 per || cent in 1947, but the tradesman s J assistant is: down to 30.5 per cent | today as against 64 per cent m 1 1947. ... 1 The above figures refer to the | classification of tradesmen and | tradesmen's assistants in the Federa | Metal Trades Award. £ It serves only as a general indica- | tion of the range of increases to be | sought by the ACTU. | The figures given relate the two | margins cited to the current si- | Capital Cities, Average basic wag of £15/8/-..
