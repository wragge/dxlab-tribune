 Vietnam | i THE decision by the Federal j Government to send an In fantry battalion to South Vietnam in my opinion is morally wrong, not in the best interest of Aus tralia, and should be revoked immediately. The Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, Senator Paltridge and other members of the Government have on many occasions expressed ex treme concern over Chinese and Russian supplying of arms to Viet nam forces. It is of no small significance that the Federal Government when rais ing these issues has been extra ordinarily reticent about continuing to expand the trade in strategic materials such as wheat, wool, steel, etc., to China and Russia. If the Federal Government is as genuinely ' concerned at the prevail ing circumstances in South Vietnam that the sending of combat troops seems to suggest, how can they in all conscience justify sending young Australian soldiers to risk the su preme sacrifice while they the Government continue to send stra tegic materials to China and Russia? Perhaps the Federal Government in reaching its decision was not unmindful of the considerable in fluence which could be exercised by the powerful wool, wheat and steel interests; rather than the con templation of the moral issue- involved. Whatever the reasons the Govern ment can be certain that it is lend ing Australia to world-wide con demnation while ever the present circumstances continue to prevail. H. GOULD. Mona vaie, oyaney.
