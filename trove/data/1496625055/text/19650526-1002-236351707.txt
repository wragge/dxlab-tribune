I The greatest of them all was | Con Colleano, an Aboriginal. I On the high wire he per- | formed a trick that no one 1 had achieved before, and to fi my knowledge it has not been J by anyone yet. I This was a forward somer- ,1 sault, landing on His feet. I Many others have done the | backward somersault. | Australian circus people not 1 only lacked the training facili- ! ties of a socialist country, but | they did not have the advant- | ages of many capitalist coun- I tries. | My mother walked the high | wire in the open at the old White City (similar to Luna \ Park). She told me of Con Col- leano's boyhood, and how he practised his wire-walking on country fences. Colleano and others became famous in the US. Everything in the circus stopped when he | performed .(at this time the American circus had three i rinns going at once) . j Some handicapped their I career bv refusing American I citizenship and came back here i to retire, as did Colleano. — I L.
