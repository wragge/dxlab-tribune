 S.O.S. | FOR SONS, \ CONSCRIPTS | ! Â£ANBERRA : Among. I ! those who attended the 1 | Peace Vigil here on Thurs- j I day were eight members I of a new organisation i called Save Our Sons t (SOS). j Thby consist of mothers of I sons conscripted or eligible for | conscription, who feel that the 1 i conscription of under-age boys i I for overseas service is morally g ! wrong. ! j On Thursday some of the ! I women who came to Canberra | | obtained an interview with Army | Minister Forbes and stated their g I objections to overseas service | j for conscripts. ' j ; DISRUPTED | J The convenor of the movement g j is -Mrs. Joyce Golgerth, of Pen- I j nant Hills, Sydney, who has a | | son in the first batch of con- | I scripts. ! j In a press statement she said: | i "Mothers resist all sorts of pres- I \ sures to bring up their children j j as useful citizens, to look for- | !s ward to useful careers and serve ! the community. Then suddenly ) I their lives are disrupted. j j ."These boys are healthy, j g strong, on the threshold of their I 1 lives, and they could come home ,J maimed, blinded or they could j die in a war which has been ! described as a bottomless pit of I violence and horror." i These boys added Mrs. Gol- g gerth, needed their parents' con- I sent to buy a car or a house or g get a passport. But the Govern- | ment was taking minors without ! the chance of the parents' refus- ) ing to let them go. | "These boys can be sent over- I seas for 4 years' service after I 6 months' training. How many j would survive 4 years in war | such as that in Vietnam? 1 "There is very great divergence ) of opinion as to whether partici- j pation in the Vietnam war can j be regarded as being in Aus- I tralia's defence. Many mothers | are convinced that it is not. g APPEAL j "We hope that this initial 1 action will spread to other j mothers throughout Australia, j We appeal to all those mothers S who agree with us to come for- ) ward now and take their stand | before it is too late." g The next meeting of SOS will J be on next Thursday, May 27, | at 8 p.m., at 166 Phillip Street, | Sydney, 7th floor. ! Information is available from I Mrs. Golgerth, 20 Maple Avenue, j Pennant Hills (WJ 3496), or Mrs. j A. Gregory, 47 Ballast Point j Road, Balmain (82 4712). j
