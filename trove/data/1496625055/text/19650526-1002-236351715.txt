 CALL FOR LABOR FACT- FINDING TRIP TO SOUTH VIETNAM BRISBANE: A Federal Labor fact-finding mis- " sion to South Vietnam was part of a declaration of wholehearted opposition to the sending of Austra lian troops to South Vietnam, made by the recent Queensland Labor-in-Politics Convention at Towns- ville. "THE mission would report to Federal Caucus on its return. The triennial Convention also called for a negotiated settle ment in Vietnam. The Federal Parliamentary Oppo sition has already called for action by the whole labor movement against the sending of troops. The motion declared: â€” "That this Convention whole heartedly supports the Federal Par liamentary Labor Party in its oppo sition to the sending of Australian troops to South Vietnam and its call for a negotiated setlement. "There is a wide public awareness by Church and other group leaders and individuals that sending these troops involves heavy Australian com mitment to an immoral enterprise. "There is ample evidence of simi lar widespread response and popular opposition in the United States and Great Britain to United States Gov ernment policy on Vietnam, which our Government is following. "The fact that conscription has been found necessary to maintain our mili tary commitments at this time under scores a wide feeling that Austra lia is compromised by the foreign policy of its Government. "It is a matter for very great con cern that Australian troops, conscript ed or otherwise, should be sent to fight in circumstances other than the most clear-cut demands of jus tice . and national security. "This Convention feels it to be representative of very many Austra lians in saying that the 'South Viet namese" Government's desire for support by any means presents Aus tralia with no such clear-cut demand for justice or national security as would provide good reason for send ing our troops to this troubled area; and calls for . their withdrawal."
