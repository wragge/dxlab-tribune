 | Queensland I Building 1 ( workers | : win more ! | money 5 | BRISBANE: Following the j I best campaign in the ! I ) Queensland building in- ! J dustry, all tradesmen have I I won a £2/2/6 a week j | margin increase and build- j i ers' laborers £1/1/3. | | The increases were granted I on May 4 and payment has been j j made retrospective to March j 1 29, 1965. 1 Up to the end of January j this year, more than 1200 stop- | ! pages have been held in the I \ building industry in support of j wage increases. J j. The £2/2/6 a week margin in- j ! crease for tradesmen is a lift j of 40 per cent in the former ! margin and is regarded as pos- I sibly the biggest single increase j won in Australia under a j major building trades award. j This brings the new margin | for building tradesmen in I Queensland at £7/8/6 a week. I Job unity followed by a mas- j sive campaign of meetings, stop- j pages and firm militant leader- ! ship resulted in the Master | Builders' Association finally j agreeing to the increases. j The building unions' cam- j paign began over 10 months ! ago with a demand for a £3 a I week industry loading. j This claim was flatly rejected j by the master builders. j About the same time the j metal trades unions also cam- j paigned for a £3 a week wage | increase. j United action was developed j between the two groups of | unions with frequent joint stop- | pages by metal and building j workers. f Earlier this year the major ! metal employers agreed to a £2/2/6 margin increase. 8 This was ! not before over 600 j 8 stoppages had been held. j I Metal unions .were also fined j 8 on a number of occasions by | I . the State Industrial Commis- J | sion. | I Later this margin was also j 1 included in the Mechanical = I Engineering Award, the main j I award in the metal industry. j I During discussions in Febru- j 1 ary, Building Workers' Indus- ? K trial Union State secretary (Mr. I | G. Dawson) told the BMA that j I workers on the job were now j 1 so angry that unless the wage - i issue was resolved, there could | 1 be a complete shut down of j 1 many big jobs. 1 -J 1 N H
