 I Beautiful Life \ Jill life life that precious thing j fel The sun glosses the starlings' throats and they sing j wl share-cropper flings the seed at the open furrow SI The bricklayer is building a house out of mud bricks, 1AH tor life, for life that precious thing ... | The children in the playground play and swing j On the girdy-round, or covetously pick a bunch of flowers, j Each flower a different colour, searching for new colours, And twining a crown of flowers to give to their best friend . The starlings syringe the ear, sparrows fall on the lost seed, The older people build houses and plant the harvest, children play and twine a many-coloured crown of flowers fit or Hfe, for life that precious thing ...
