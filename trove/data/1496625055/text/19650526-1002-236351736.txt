 "Duke" Tritton I dies in Sydney 1 "QUKE TRITTON", singer | and writer of bush songs, | author of "Time. Means Tuck- j er", a man who mastered most | things that challenged him, | died quietly in Sydney last | week. | The verse above is . from his song | "Shearing in a Bar"— -which he said | he composed . with several other | shearers. | "Duke" could talk about the big | shearing r strikes from close know- | Vlge, could yarn as easily with the | Qvernor-General as with a young | ' fftlk song enthusiast— and his life | spanned more than a half century of | Australian experience and tradition. | Born in 1886 in Sydney, he learned | to sing at church and school concerts \ at a very early age. When he was ten, \ his uncle Tom Miller, a blade shearer, f taught him many shearing songs, | bush ballads, and yarns of the shear- \ ing strikes. \ In 1905 he went to the bush with \ Dutchy Bishop and they sang their way all over the North and Central West of N.S.W. and were shearing, droving, fencing and doing all kinds of bush work for the next four years. His songs written at that time in clude "Shearing in a Bar", "The Gooseneck Spurs" and "Hughie." "Duke's" family and descendents run into the eighties and have spread far and wide through Sydney and New South Wales. One occasion of many from "Duke's" singing performances that comes to mind was when Pete Seeger called him to the stage during one of his concerts at the Union Theatre. The crowd was already applauding before they could see "Duke's" tall, angular frame, coming down the aisle, his white hair shining like silver in the long spotlight slanting down to the stage. Other people will have their own ! recollection of moments of "Duke's" L singing. N Another time as he paused between | verses of one of his long songs, a lady started to applaud as if hed J finished: "O there's plenty more yet, J said "Duke" with his usual frankness. I And last year at the Four Capitals | Folk Song concert at The Sydney | Conservatorium there is the untor- | gettable picture of "Duke" with botn j| arms around beaming young singer , leading them in the finale of Liic || Go the Shears." 1 He was a life member of the Bus pi Music Club and is recorded on tne || "Wattle" label. || "Duke" as part of the living tradi- S tion will live on in his own songs, M the songs of his people and in t e || memory of those 'voung and old v> 0 a K11CW 111111. jj
