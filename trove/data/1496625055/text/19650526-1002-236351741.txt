 NATO meeting finished early MOSCOW: Disagreements within the recent NATO Council meeting forced it to conclude earlier than anticipated. The NATO session in London ended a day prematurely, due to criticism of American policies in Europe, Dominica and Vietnam, and of West German insanities, and French and British restiveness. Tass' London correspondent says Harold Wilson "delivered direct at tacks on his allies â€” the United States and West Germany. "He blamed them for a policy which worsens the financial burden of Britain who is compelled to bear 'an unfair burden' in NATO. "As pointed out by the press, Wilson's speech caused a panic in the American delegation and one delegate even suggested that Presi dent Johnson should rebuff Wil son." France again bluntly refused to support America on Vietnam. The West Germans are alarming several NATO allies; in Berlin they are putting demolition charges in bridges for war demolitions; in Bavaria, the Bundeswehr has held amphibious exercises designed for the "rapid transfer of troops across the Danube," which flows through non-German territories, and is per sisting with plans to lay a nuclear mine belt along the Socialist fron tiers.
