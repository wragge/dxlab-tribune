 NEW IDEAS FOR COMMUNIST REVIEW 1 T"HE May issue of the "Com munist Review"; now on sale, announces a policy of en couraging controversy and dis- cussion of important ... public questions. Differing views are to be sought from writers and readers and pro posals made for the development of lively debating groups in organisa tions, workplaces, coffee lounges and homes. Also envisaged are discussion con ferences, seminars to exchange views on subjects which will be reflected in the magazine. Several articles on local government affairs and one by E. Armstrong on the role of art and the artist in this issue provide stimulating material for disdussion. A factual survey on the situation of white-collar workers is a forerunner for further controversial articles on this question. In future issues the struggle in South East Asia, conscription, the various roads to socialism, the Labor Party, What Does Unity really mean? Can Australia preserve her resources? What is freedom and what is demo cracy? and a hundred other questions are to be canvassed. Informative material in the May issue includes Notes of the Month on the balance of payments crisis (L. Aarons), the crumbling A.W.U. hier archy and its relationship to the A.L.P. (J. Hughes), The Downfall of Play ||| ford Government (J.
