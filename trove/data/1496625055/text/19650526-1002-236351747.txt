 . — # '05. Against color 1 bar in sport a By "The Challenger" """ 1 j| yHE national confer ence of the New Zealand trade union movement has given... a I n 1 an important leaa m the fight against the color bar in sport. The unions, meeting in Wellington this month in the Federation of Labor Conference, called on ' every trade unionist in NZ If to boycott' all matches or $ functions in the forthcom- % ing tour of NZ by the 4 South African Springboks (Rugby Union) team. 1 It is also reported that the .% Russian tennis player, Tomas ' A Lejus, withdrew from his match J in the French tennis champion- | ships against a South African "J player— for the same reason. Some years ago the Rev. David 1 Sheppard, the English test 1 cricketer, refused to play against I Hf.: . a r wav ovum xxnjujtm ujuuxeters oe- i cause of their apartheid policy. 1 Last year at Wimbledon, the 1 Russian Davis Cup player, Alex- I ander Metreveli and other Soviet, I Czechoslovak and Hungarian j players withdrew from the tourn- I ament as protest against the \\ i South Africans apartheid. Also, the International Olympic Committee banned the South Africans from the Tokyo Olym- 1 pics because of its apartheid pol- 1 icy. % Rugby League ' By Ron Mackerras > CYDNEY CITY RUGBY league selectors did a good job with & the two City teams that played j Country. They were too good, | 30-2 and 23-5 being the scores, Uj with both teams easing up. N The City selectors could have gf shown more initiative by choos- ing young promising players and 1 trialled them with experienced 1 players such as Johns, Gasnier, |j Lisle, Raper and Walsh. 9 Ken Thornett must have |j known he was unavailable for the IS New Zealand tour and should || have notified the selectors. As it | was, his selection denied a young | three-quarter his opportunity. i I still prefer Langlands to || Johns but both are brilliant and | nothing is lost by either selec- I tion. I would like to see Lisle chosen as centre and Harrison of Coun- 4 try or Diett of North Sydney _j chosen as five-eight with Billy Smith at half. , I Raper and Coote stand out as i locks. Thompson of Newcastle j and Beath of' Eugowra would -l&lt; benefit from playing alongside J Walsh; Quinn, Vievers, O'Neil J and young Morgan of Manly. | I am in the country on holidays and have not had the benefit of || seeing Saturday's game. To select m Arthur Summons in the State y side ahead of Sydney's wealth of |S halves or five-eights would be a ||j tragedy. J|
