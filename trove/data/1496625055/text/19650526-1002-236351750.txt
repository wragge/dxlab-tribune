 [?] "For freedom" — Menzies From the Sydney Morning Herald, April 5, 1965: "Melbourne, Sunday: American intervention in Vietnam was the greatest act of moral courage since Britain stood alone in the last world war, the Prime Minister (Sir Robert Men zies) said today. "Sir Robert said many people were quick to criticise the US, but it had undertaken on behalf of the free world 'one of the greatest ever manifestations of justice and principle'. . . " 'Why was America spending so much money in Vietnam?' he asked the congregation, adding: "'She has no investment there, she does not want that small strip of land for a colony and yet she is spending large sums and losing her own troops. " 'The answer is that Americans believe human freedom is being challenged and that challenge must be met'." 'Tor metals" — Eisenhower "Now let us assume that we lost Indo-China. If Indo- China goes, several things happen right away. The peninsula, the last bit of land hanging on down there, would be scarcely defensible. "The tin and tungsten that we so greatly value from that area would cease coming. . . So when the US votes four hundred million dollars to help that war, we are not voting a giveaway program. "We are voting for the cheapest way that we can to prevent the occurrence of something that would be of a most terrible significance to the United States of America, our security, our power and ability to get certain things we need from the riches of the Indo-Chinese territory and from South-east Asia." — President Eisenhower, addressing US State Governors' j conference, August 4, 1953. i
