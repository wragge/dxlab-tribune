After seven years of research and writing Noah had the rare experience of seeing his first play for legitimate theatre presented on Broadway- produced by Michael Ellis and William Hammerstein in October 1963 at the ANTA Theatre. Warren Curtis, the advocate, inter ested Noah and he said of him: "I was interested in the juxtaposi tion of the conservative Boston lawyer and the anarchists. This lawyer was not a man you would expect to take their defence. I wondered why." On this he developed a very real and convincing figure whose reaction to the case and his development with it are the motivating forces of the play.
