 'Catholic Weekly' and Vietnam To the Editor of the Tribune: |N a recent Catholic Weekly there was some excellent and interest ing material (particularly a letter from Morris West) deploring the Vietnam situation. However a poem printed says that an Australian soldier killed at Lae, in the last war, had died by "an Asian hand". This obviously inters that the Asians Menzies wants us to fight today are the same, limb by limb, as the sol diers of Imperial Nippon. Tho Asians we are orrending and killing today were our allies during the war against Tojo, and suffered far more than Australians, soldiers and citizens at their hands . . . Men zies is buying us blues with former . friends and destroying our prestige with people who are a potentially unlimited market for our goods. It was regrettable to rind this in difference to historical truth and pre- ; sent day reality in a paper which ! does print so much good material. I V. M. (Sydney). 1
