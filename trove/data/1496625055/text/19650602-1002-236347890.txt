""HE best of last week's tele vision came from India, and j was shown on "Sunday Night j Theatre" from Channel 2 at j 8.30 pm (May 23). I Titled "India's Haunting Passage," I it showed three aspects of Indian I culture. j Firstly "The Little Ballet Company j of Bombay" presented an old puppet folk play in which live dancers were tne manonettes. This was beautnuuy danced and enchanting to watch. The second episode was a short film written and directed by Satya jit- Ray, famous director of the "Apa" trilogy. (Incidentally, Ray will be a guest at this year's Film Festival commencing this Friday.) - The short film titled "Two" was about two small boys, one very rich | and the other very poor. Ray's sensi- | tive and acute observation of the gulf g that separated these two gave this film a strong social truth. In the third item Ravi Saukar (who was recently in Australia) played the Raga, one of the world's oldest instru ments. Accompanied by a drummer, he extemporised on an opening theme, and the exquisite artistry of this I Indian musician was a joy to listen to. f The rest of the week had little of v.: interest apart from a few reliables jp such as "Z Cars," "Lucy," "Tha | Villains," and "Love Story."
