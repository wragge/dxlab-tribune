 [?] | Many will miss i I Joan Sutherland j |OAN SUTHERLAND'S | triumphant return to her | homeland is somewhat I marred by the fact that 8 ticket prices to see and I hear her sing will limit the I content of her audience of true music-lovers, students | and teachers. Even a former teacher of Miss | Sutherland will be unable to buy 1 a seat, cheapest of which is three | guineas. | Most tickets will cost seven ! guineas with . the August gala opening in Sydney catering to I the snob set at a mer.e ten | guineas. f What a contrast to theatre and | culture in the' Soviet Union, | where anyone can see great 1 singers, artists, dancers at an | accessible price. | One music critic summed up | the Sutherland opera season f nicely by calling it "a commercial 2 undertaking, and you can only | protest in the same way as you S might protest at the price of ( socks — but not buying." jj # 9 world's great need is for | understanding and goodwill | . . . there is something practical » which we can all, whatever our fi age or occupation, be doing to ) help." I These are quotes from the 0 Queen's Commonwealth Day mes- 1 sage. | What a pity our Prime Minis- | tcr does not share her Majesty's 1 sentiments. Eis idea of showing 9 understanding and goodwill in 1 South-East Asia, for instance, is | by sending our troops to war-torn J Vietnam. j 2 gRITISH women, according to i a recent survey, spend on:: ? hundred million pounds a year | on cosmetics. i Manufacturers of cosmetics | spend millions of pounds pro- moting gimmicks like the current j "London Look" which has just I been launched. I It would be interesting to 9 count up all the different "looks" j our faces were supposed to have i had in the last few years — all I gimmicks in the goal of selling | more make-up. j How about the "natural look" ! for a change? No cosmetics, just \ some protective cream on lips j and skin. I The cosmetic houses would go ( broke, women's skins would be | healthier, and we'd have more j money in our purses. I $ $ | XTESTERDAY, June 1, was | International Children's Day... The tenth point of United Na tions' charter on the rights ofj children has been chosen as the theme of this year's celebrations, I "Children should be protected | against all social, religious and j racial discrimination." j This tenth point is not being I carried out, of course, as we are I well aware of the jailing of Negro ' children in America, slaughter of ! Vietnamese babies and the dis crimination against our own Aboriginal children. # s # JgRIDAL wear manufacturers in j America are worried because ; their sales are "not keeping pace S with the wedding march," says a 8 press report. So by means of a I 'survey," manufacturers have | come up with the following: I "The more money spent on a ! formal affair the more guarantee j of a lasting marriage. 'Quickie' f marriages lead to quick div- » orces." | This' rationalising couldn't be a I | way of saving the manufacturers i from going bankrupt, could it? ! Many couples today are using \ their finance, to set up a new j home, rather than go in for the = trappings of a formal or "white" | wedding. j I |F Australia is going to hold her S place in the world of pport, I more official recognition in the g way of government grants will j need to be arranged.
