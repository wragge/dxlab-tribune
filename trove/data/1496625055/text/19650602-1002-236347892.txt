 mmmmmammmmmmmmmmmmmmmammmmmmm v Death of Alf Russell WOLLONGONG: Tribune re- grets to announce the death of Comrade Alf Russell of the N.S.W. South Coast. Alf joined the Communist Party in 1923 and played an ac tive part in all the struggles of the workers on the South Coast up to a few years ago when he became seriously ill. Particularly during the unem ployed struggles and the fights against the New Guard Alf proved his sterling worth as a working class fighter. Alf was one of the best known Tribune sellers on the Coast. A few years ago he was selected as a Tribune Popular Seller. He threw all his energies into the campaign and practically single-handed raised over Â£100 to be placed second to the Com petition. A large crowd attended the service being conducted by his own Comrades as Alf wished it. Tribune extends their sincere sympathies to the relatives of Alf Russell. I- : . i
