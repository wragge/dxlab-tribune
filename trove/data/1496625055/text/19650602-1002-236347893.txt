 Sth. Aust. iState ALP Conference yDELAIDE: Agenda items tor the June annual convention of the ALP in South Australia reveal a continuing desire of Labor Party members to ad vance a policy to solve the problems of the people. The resolutions range from pro posals directed against certain mono polies down to the particular needs of small groups such as pensioners, Aborigines, etc. A notable weakness is the lack of attention to the big issues of war and peace. Important resolutions call for the oil and mining industries to be in cluded in industries which should be nationalised and for a plan of public education on the policy of nationalisa tion. One from the Boilermakers requests an examination of the Indenture Acts under which BHP has built its indus trial complex in Whyalla. The other, from the Seamen's Union, calls for action against the wealthy Standard- - Vacuum Oil Company and its refinery at Port Stanvac. The Gas Employees' Union has sub mitted proposals for the public owner ship of the State Gas resources. The Railways Union proposes withdrawal of permission to BHP to build a private railway to work the lime-sand deposits at Coffin Bay. Agenda items call for an extension of price control with, in some cases, particular reference to electricity cnarges favouring domestic consumers before monopoly and .cheaper housing and rentals. Last year's Convention set up a special committee to examine dif ferent methods of voting as part of the necessary moves for electoral reform and to overcome the Playford gerrymander. The committee is to recommend the continuation of the policy of "first past the post" voting and this conflicts with other proposals f ar the much more democratic pro cedure of proportional representation. Varying sections of the ALP hava sharp differences on this question and this may provide the Convention with one of its keenest divisions.
