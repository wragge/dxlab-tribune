 Elections J WISH to congratulate you on your fine publication, "Tribune." After a Liberal win in the State elections in NSW, much more work is needed for the future outlook of the working class parties, the ALP, or the alternative, the Communist Party. Some of the voting changes could be put down to circumstances. However, an election can be swayed towards the Liberals because of informal voting, ignorance, the DL-P, and unfair over-use of T.V. and radio by capitalist monopolies. Much more will be needed, espe cially in seats where the Socialist Party lost in future campaigns. â€” I.B. (Stanmore, NSW).
