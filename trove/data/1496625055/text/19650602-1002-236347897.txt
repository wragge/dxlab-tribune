 Liberal threat of gerrymander A LTHOUGH the Liberal Govern ment has been in office barely a couple of weeks, some disturbing indications are present that a gerrymander is being planned to give Liberal Party associates con trol of the Sydney City Council regardless of democratic majori ties. The State Government has even indicated that it may postpone the December 4 City Council elections in order to secure time for a new Boundaries Commission to recom mend changes to the existing voting system. The Herald Civic Roundsman on Friday, May 21, in an extraordinary comment article, says: "Recommen dations by the Commissioners who will inquire into the Sydney City Council ward system wil need to be drastic if they are to result in the overthrow of the Labor administra tion." - This is' strong language. But the Herald Civic Roundsman leaves no doubt that "drastic" measures to "overthrow" ' the present Council are certainly oil the agenda. He pointer out' that if the Civic Reform Association proposals for voting changes are adopted by the Commission and accepted by the Liberal Government, "Civic Reform aldermen will dominate the next Cpuncil." Suggested Civic Reform changes are to create several new wards in the Gipps area, despite the fact that this ward has only 13,500 electors compared to 30,000 to other wards. The Civic Reform changes pro posed would directly and most un- democratically favor the big business houses, department stores, banks and insurance houses, etc., which dre concentrated in the Gipps Ward. Since the Herald has entered into discussion on changes in Sydney City Council voting system, it would be a good idea to reopen public discussion in the Herald pages about the real democratic principles which would be involved in return to the . proportional representation system. â€” W.
