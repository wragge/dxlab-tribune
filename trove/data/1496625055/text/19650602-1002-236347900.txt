". . . The presence of any foreign troops in Vietnam is a clear breach of the Geneva Convention, and the , only foreign troops in that country | to date are the military personnel of the United States, Australia and South Korea. "We do not support the decision of the Australian Government to send Australian troops to Vietnam, and practically the entire labor movement in Australia is in opposi tion to this decision. "The labor movement of Australia is the most powerful single force in our country and this opposition cannot be ignored with impunity. "We are prepared to support a assist the proposals of your Gcwem- ment to render economic and m - terial aid to under-developed coun tries to enable them to overc , problems of hunger and pove y, and we consider that this is the y way to win the support of countries of Asia. . ,fnre "War must be outlawed conflicts such as this in Vietnam flare up into a world-wide war, which would destroy mil of people."
