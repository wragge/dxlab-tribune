 nhSiiiEifslRrfc? "CRIME AND FOLLY" OF INVADING VIETNAM I |N our relations with j Eastern Asia we seem j bent on crime and folly. ! Future historians will give j SCant credence to the pretexts 1 by which it is sought to justify I our invasion of Vietnam, but 3 wj|| regard it as an act of naked | aggression which treats sol- 1 emn international engage- 1 ments as worthless scraps of 13 paper. 1 This wanton betrayal of our 1 own welfare, and of the prin- I ciples of freedom which man- | kind is laboring to establish. 8 will fail, but with -the needless f expenditure of much blood and i suffering. I y/hen these tumults are past j Australia will still be where it | is now, and its people will have 1 the same neighbors. The in- | terests of foreign investment, i| and of military and diplomatic Jj vanity wiil not then be thrown 3 into the scale against human I agony. A reputation for syco- 1 phantic cowardice will earn us j only contempt and hatred. Is | this the best that Australia 4 can do? â€” E. E. V. Collocctt. I (Eppinq).
