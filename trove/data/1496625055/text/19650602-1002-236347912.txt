This also is not a big book, having only 223 pages, and it is apparently a printing of a series of ten talks on the subject. "What is Dialectical Materialism?" deals more extensively with the sub ject than the Australian publication, ,but it is nevertheless easy to read, particularly if one has conducted some previous study of the subject.
