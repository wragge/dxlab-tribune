 The Slouch of Vietnam Why should I wear the new slouch hat, the slouch of Vietnam, Why should I share the napalm-guilt of blundering Uncle Sam, Why should I bayonet peasant kids who fiqht for rights and rice, Why should I spill this southern blood in a sucker's sacrifice? I think of my old uncles and their mates who lie so cold On the far-off fields of Flanders, it's rumoured they were sold, Yes, I know that life is precious apd I know that life is dust, But should I throw my life away if a brass-hat says I must? A chilly dusk is falling here, the box trees' shadows stretch - And through the ring-barked clumps I see the vanished soldiers fetched, The tall plume on the horseman, the slant brim down beJow, As through the mists of memory those slaughtered slouches go. I There young Mick, the cricketer from frosty Eucum- bene, And "pally" Tom, the skinner from the southern Riverine, And troop on troop the squadrons pass, the sun across their cheeks â€” Clay-cold and pale as cellar-grass, and mot one soldier speaks. The slouch of brave Gal lipoli that blinded the diggers' eyes, The slouch of bloody Passchendale where the shell-shock case still cries, The martyrs, hanged in Changi, the heroes killed at Lae, But the slouch of jungle paddies is a slouch 1 cannot pay. Why should 1 wear that new slouch hat, the slouch of Vietnam, Why should I share the napalm-guilt of blundering Uncle Sam, Why should I bayonet peasant kids who fight for rights and rice,' Why should I spill this southern blood in a sucker's sacrifice?
