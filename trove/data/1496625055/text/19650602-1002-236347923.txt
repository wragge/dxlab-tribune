 [?] Modern living J makes us too sofm By THE CHALLENGER AN American professor of physical education, Professor Vernon S. Sprague, recently made the statement that modern liv ing was making the world's people too soft. Professor Sprague claimed that with the high development of | technology there was a cor- I responding need for greater | sporting activity that gave some j intensive form of activity. It was significant that two very j commercialized sports, howling !and golf were not of the type recommended by the professor as | giving some intensive form of activity. It is a poor commentary on ! our social system when more at- j tention is given to the "cash re- . j turns" than the physical benefit I derived from particular sports. I This is basically the cause of j the very low standard of sport ing facilities and gymnasiums at j present available in Australia and ! in particular Sydney. A discussion recently with Syd- ney school childreg, revealed that (in the minds of the children at I least) there is a very great need j for a big improvement in the !s physical education requirements of schools. (Gymnasiums are so ' I inadequate that in one instance | a gym actually housed the school j tuck shop). j There is a great need for gym- !nasium equipment and change- room facilities. One boy said that I at his school of 600, there were j only six showers, with no hot | water. I The discussion with the chil- j dren revealed that the schools I were endeavouring to overcome S the lack of facilities by having | the classes engage in swimming j in the summer and some kind of j field sport (cricket or softball) I in the winter. j Although the calls to more j physical activity like those of I Professor Sprague are sensible | and need heeding, it is obvious !3 that before this can be done, a basic requirement is the provi- I sion of facilities by the govern- | ment. j Soccer ' | I SOCCER 's rdeed a truly in- Jternational game and the Aus tralian Soccer Federation should | be congratulated for the splendid | way it is propagating the game | here and at the same time lifting I the standard of Australian soccer. » Although apparently ready to j accept any form of constructive J criticism, the Australian soccer I world seems to have a basic in gredient of its own for the lift ing of the standard of play in ) Australia, and that is to engage I the best available competition in ! the world to play here. | So far this year, Australia has | seen the locals tangle with such | stiff opposition as the Moscow Torpedoes, the famous Chelsea S team (at present) and as Trib- | une goes to press the visiting J German team VFB Stuttgart. " From Milan in Italy, Jim Bayutti 3$ ; the vice-chairman of the Austra- M lian Soccer Federation, is report- Pi ed to have reached a provision- ''4 al agreement with the Italian 4 first-division club Milan to tour Australia next year. jp| Importing and competing M against top-notch overseas teams I has given the game a big boost $ here, as shown by the increased fl confidence by supporters and R players alike. II The Australian Eleven has been I able to gain a couple of draws I , in matches with Chelsea. | Although these matches must i| be carefully analysed, before giv- m ing any undue merit to the home 11 team, it is safe to say that Aus IS tralian soccer is of a much higher kj ' standard than was previously If realized. SfS "Clay-pigeon" | THE recent world heavyweight M championship title fight fias- ' co has caused a spate of contro l;J versy highlighted by a comment |J from former boxing champion p Gene Tunney who called it "the if most offensive debasement of IS , boxing I have seen." % The millions of television view- | ers who witnessed the bout | . would probably agree with Turn | . ney, but such is the nature of g boxing, that we may never really | . know the truth as to whether or 1 not the fight was fixed— unless M somebody in the know spills the m beans. M: What the public and the ex- || perts can only do, is make as- |I sumptions. a In the past, fight. Jtans have 18 screamed fix, after witnessing |fi bouts that ended early, and thus jfl deprived „ them of what they !9 thought was value for their mon- jjlj One such example was the / 1 fight fatality between the then I world : heavyweight champion | Primo Camera and Ernie Schaat | who went down from a blow thai | wouldn't have put a dent in a | marshmallow. Hardly had the fans stopped | screaming fix, than Schaff was i pronounced dead. ft Judging from the relaxed ex g pression on Liston's face after the alleged knockout, the only con- m elusion that fans can come to is || . . that because of the fantastic :|j amount of lucre involved the |1 fight had to go to plan. M > That money is the root of all |g evil is indeed a truism of boxing m as was pointed out by E. F. Dowl- ||j ing in his hook "Fistiana", over a w hundred years ago, when he said, 9. . . there were many who sur- ||B rounded it (boxing), actuated by ||| far other motives than an un- ||| sophisticated admiration of cour ||| age or manly vigor." ||| The, motive mentioned by Hgj Dowling being the fact that ||j "large sums of money were given esi as prizes". g| If such was the case over a |g| century ago, what can be expect- ||j ed today, when- as much as 4.o n million dollars is involved. H Is there then a solution to me mm problem of "professional" b? H ing? Indeed there is, and that is m — : in the conducting of well co in I trolled and organised "amateu w I boxing. .... K. I The latest demonstration ot trie m I increasing popularity of amate H | boxing is the recent 16th Eu - 9 I peari boxing championships n I in the capital of the rn|, 9 L Democratic Republic, Ber 9 where 172 competitors from H countries I took part. 9
