 Local anger at latest Ansett grab I pORT MORESBY: Strong I local feeling has been I aroused by the taking away | from a local company of a nighly profitable air route and handing rt over to a subsidiary of Ansett Trans- I port Industries, Ansett ! Mandated Airlines. The managing Director of Ter ritory Airlines Mr. D. Buchanan said last week that after his com pany had pioneered and flown the Madang Cliimbu route for 13 years the licence had been given to Ansett. Mr. Buchanan said that he had been told by the Director of Gen eral of Civil Aviation Mr. D. G. Anderson in Melbourne that the Department intended to give the licence to Ansett. I Mr. Buchanan came to New Guinea in 1947 as a sixteen year old and has a family and home in the territory. The general feeling here is that the writing is on the wall for Territory Airlines who. will only be | able to fly a charter flight into I Chimbu once a month. I FOOTNOTE: Tribune can now . I confirm its recent report that the two top public relations men from the Civil Aviation Depart ment in Melbourne, had been taken over by Reg Ansett. 1 This is another example of how | the Menzies Government is. help- H big Ansett. 1 Judging from the growing pub- I lie criticism of the Ansett mono- | poly grab, these PR men will be I kept pretty busy. lLMimj.lMllHIBUMmiBMIIlUllilLIIHUnui.lll '| I ||, ||||,|| ||||| I II IIIHIIIHHI I
