 Chief Sec. j defends j | ! treatment of | Aborigines j I THE Chief Secretary of I j 1 NSW, Mr. E. A. Willis, j I in officially opening a con- j j ference on the problems j of education ot Aborigines x in NSW, astounded dele- I | gates by defending Aus- 1 ' tralia's treatment of Abori- | 1 gines. i 8 Mr. Willis, who is the respon- | | sible N.S.W. Minister for Abori- | !- gines, expressed the official mind g when he sa).d, "Our treatment I 8 of Aborigines will stand up to 1 I any genuine examination, but the g i best will in the world cannot ! I stop deliberate distortion." j | The conference held last week- | | end was organised by the Consul- J S tative Committee on Aboriginal | S Education, and the Department 8 | of Adult Education of the 8 j University of Sydney. | | Mrs. Gloria Phelan, Research g ! Officer N.S.W. Teachers' Federa- | | tion, highlighted the problem in a | U report, "that there was a shock- I Sing disparity between the attain- ! iments of Aboriginal children and 9 the rest of the School population. 8 I Of 514 children covered in a \ survey of Aboriginal pupils in j secondary schools by the Teach- | » ers' Federation only one had J reached 5th year and only 48 I Iliad proceeded beyond second g form. j Almost 60 per cent were rated f as slow learners. | She said that most Aboriginal ! ! children are at a tremendous dis- 9 | advantage because of the social 8 i and economic conditions under g > which they live. f J "They are in fact socially handi- | | capped. | I3 "We just put them into or- S dinary classes and when they 9 | do not do well their poor per- | Iformance is attributed to lack g of ability. I | "You cannot just pluck the | | children out of their environ- | ment. ! ! "You have to change their en- 9 j vironment by replacing the hum- 8 j pies with proper houses, by pro- g \ viding jobs with opportunities ! | for trade and other training and j by making all forms of racial dis- I ! crimination a punishable of- | j fence." g j Mrs. Phelan said that classes ! could be kept small enough to | J enable aboriginal children to £ | receive individual attention. j : She suggested that pre-school I ! classes could be conducted to j | help aboriginal children improve g their command of English and I S general knowledge before start- | I ing primary school. j
