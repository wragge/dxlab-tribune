 Kharkov, Soviet Ukraine "t/ODKA is potent at the best of times, but when it contains chillies it is not a drink for two- pot screamers. This brew is called Gorilka and we first met up with it at Kharkov in the Ukraine. There were no casualties during this first encounter, but probably a few near misses. The Kharkov people have other good ideas not the least being that they pay low rents or buy their own flats on a co-operative basis. The delegation visited a flat of a married couple who were earning 100 roubles a month each and who had bor rowed three-quarters of the money needed for the purchase on one-half per cent, interest and were paying it back at 12 roubles per month. So it appears that Soviet citizens can own their own dwellings. Famous revolutionary Artem was exiled in Australia for a number of years before being able to return to Russia to participate in the Rus sian Revolution. He was in Khar kov when Soviet power was pro claimed there and played a . leading role in this historic struggle. His son now lives there and is married to La Pasionaria's daughter. â€”-From Bill Sutton (with the Australian May Day Delegation visiting the Soviet Union).
