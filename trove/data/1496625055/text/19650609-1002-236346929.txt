 South Vietnam Why are the American forces in South Vietnam? While arguments centre around the reasons they give for interven- tion, they can still confuse a lot of people. But they do not say a word about economic reasons they have for holding on to what they can in South Vietnam. v Before the war Indo-China, mainly in the South, produced 60,000 tons of crude rubber, enough for all the needs of France and some going to the USA. In 1951 rubber exports were over £20 million; and by 1954 production has risen to 90,000 tons —cheap rubber for the US market. Before the war, according to Far East— Social Geography, by A. Peter son, Indo-China supplied one-quarter of the world rice market. Exports fell after the war, but in 1951 its export of rice was £16 million, and in 1957 the production of South Vietnam alone was 3 million metric tons, about the same as the Philip pines with a far larger population. Before the war Cambodia was the second most important source of pepper in the world. South Vietnam is a very fertile tropical country, with a very cheap labor force; a very good source for the auick dollar in rubber and rice. VICTOR WILLIAMS. Fremantle.
