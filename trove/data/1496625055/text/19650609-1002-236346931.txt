 ! Banned folksinqers J AM a new reader of Tribune and I must admit that 1 agree with most of the opinions and state ments presented in the Daner. Being a student I have a great interest in folk music and I was surprised to see Eileen Allison in her column "T View" praising the Ameri can show "Hootenany". This show, produced by the Ameri can Broadcasting Company, A.B.C. T V. has placed a so called "blacklist- th f' n ne snÂ£ers fr singing songs at the producers feel are "Un- American". The singers affected are Bob Dylan, eter Seeger and others and they are anned because they sing songs for | Peace, nuclear disarmament, racial | equality and other topics that the j likeV1S1n ksses bi America do not 1 sh ou bring this to the | ttention of your readers. |l Harry Allen, Jnr. || Balgowlah (N.S.W.).
