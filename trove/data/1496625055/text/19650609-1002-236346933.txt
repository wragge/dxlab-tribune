 No war in Australia ! WE fought the Germans in two world wars; a few years after we were told "times have changed and they are now friends." In World War 2 many people think we were saved from Japanese inva sion by the timely appeal from the then Prime Minister, John Curtin, to the Americans for. help. They were then our allies. Now â€” haven't times changed again? Do we not find that America has broken the United Nations Charter? We are also aiding and abetting her by allowing our boys to go to fight in Vietnam. Individuals also aid and abet by their silence. If you, the reader, do not protest against sending our boys to inter fere in the internal struggles of another country you must not com plain when that country or its allies start dropping bombs on us. It is a matter now for you to act to KEEP THE WAR OUT OF AUS TRALIA. Ramsgate, NEW. E. LEAHY.
