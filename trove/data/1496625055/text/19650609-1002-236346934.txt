 Load of malarkey 0a-d of malarkey ha' ever been printed than an article m last Friday's local paper. It said the far eastern combine them a . companies, not one of thev , ,5a. n owned, decided that | > would increase freight rates by \ A 'A from five to ten per cent from Australia to the Orient. The increase they said was due to the slow turn around in Austra lian Ports. Even the ship-owner in his more truthful moments declares that the turn abound of ships in Australia is among the fastest in the world. Australia is continuing to pay the price of not having a fleet running overseas of its own. This country is being held to ransom, to the tune of roughly Â£400 million every year, by a system of three overseas combines, mostly English, and the Federal Government, be ing as it is a sycophant of mon opoly flatly refuses to build a com petent overseas fleet and places ev ery obstacle in the way of present Australian ships trading away while opening the door to foreign owned vessels. This does not only apply to ov erseas shipping but to coastal ship ping as well. The system of lic ensing ships is strangling local shipping. The overseas ships that are licensed on the coast contrib ute nothing or very little to the ec onomy or the employment of Aust ralians. John Ellis, Fremantle.
