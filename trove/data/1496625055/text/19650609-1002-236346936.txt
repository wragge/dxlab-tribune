 Finance for education ADELAIDE: A strong plea for Federal Government financial aid for education has been made by the SA Labor Government's Minister for Education. (Mr. R. Loveday). "The rate of increase in school numbers has been higher in SA than in other States in the years since the war," he said. "This has been accompanied by a sharp increase in the ratio of children in Government schools to the- total population. This position has been emphasised because our immigration quota is ahead of other States."
