 Those two Yanks The achievements of American spacemen White ' and McDivitt — successrully efnulating the earlier feat of a Soviet pair who opened the door to "walking in space" — have rightly earned the admiration of peoples in all coun- tries. The policies of United States imperialism — as demon strated in Vietnam and Rominica — are arousing the concern, anger and hatred of millions of people around the world and so must be brought to ultimate defeat; But this does not alter the fact that the working people have a common class bond that encompasses Americans as well as all others. . Despite the militarist US rulers, those two Yanks deserve .all credit! - v if tf ttff f fff f ff ffff ff f f f f f
