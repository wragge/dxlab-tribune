 RIGHT TO PROTEST IS AT STAKE AS Tribune goes to press, water side workers have stopped work in all States to discuss their cam paign for pensions and to answer attacks on their union by Judge Gallagher, wealthy shipowners and sections of the daily press. At the same time, New South Wales rail and transport unions are meet ing to consider the reply from the State Government to long-standing demands for wage increases. The general demand for increased wages throughout NSW is indicated by the number of stoppages in the metal trades for over-award payments. In the past 12 months, out of 222 strikes 112 were for over-award pay mentsâ€” i.e. increased wages. The Metal Trades Employers' Pre sident (Mr. Pardoe) wants the Arbitra tion Act amended to state that strikes are opposed to the principle of com pulsory arbitration. A Sydney University lecturer (Mr. P. Mills) has told the employers they can sue the unions and their officials for damages, as a legal remedy against strikes. The shipowners have burdened the economy with further freight increases while threats are made to use the Crimes Act and dismissal from the industry of wharfies who dare strug gle against the policy of sending troops to Vietnam. The Menzies Government is tighten ing restrictions on freedom to travel abroad and introducing new penalties against unionists. Employers and their spokesmen, in cluding the National Civic Council, are using the Vietnam issue as excuse to call for "action" against all oppon ents of the Government's foreign pol icy, and against trade union struggles for economic needs. These are some illustrations of last weekend's call by the Commun ist Party Central Committee for ac- Ition to defend democracy while op posing the intervention in Vietnam and seeking higher living standard!.
