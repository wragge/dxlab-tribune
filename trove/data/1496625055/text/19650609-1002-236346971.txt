 awareness of Absrisines' j plight. ! gYDNEY. "Results of our demonstrations over dis crimination against Abori gines in New South Wales country towns v/ere spectacu lar", Mr. Charles Perkins told Tribune last week. Mr. Perkins led the demonstrative survey carried out by Sydney Uni versity students early this year. "The public are now far more aware of the problem and the Aborigines far more demanding in their deter mination to achieve equal rights. "Both the Kempsey and Mooree coun cils have lifted the ban on Aborigines at their swimming baths. "However, I believe it is necessary to keep an eye on the situation in Mooree because of the reluctant way the council lifted the ban. (The Mooree Council recently re placed its former ordinance authoris ing exclusion of Aborigines from the town swimming pool with a new ordinance authorising exclusion of any person on "hygienic" grounds.) Mr. Perkins said he had recently at tended a meeting of Aborigines who decided to nominate their president, Mr. Harry Hall, as a candidate in the municipal council elections. They also took steps to see that all Aborigines made themselve eligible to vote. "There is still quite a job to be done in Walgett," he added. "When I approached a local theatre proprietor to allow Aborigines to sit upstairs, he said this would mean he would lose money, but if I liked to compensate him he would lift the ban."
