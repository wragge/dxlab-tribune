 City marchers in Newcastle demand 'end Vietnam war9 NEWCASTLE: Over 300 people marched through the main street in Newcastle last Saturday in protest against the Federal Government's inter vention in Vietnam. pOLLOWING the march a meeting in Civic Park unani mously demanded that the Uni- xea orares ana Australian gov ernments "observe the Geneva Agreements, withdraw from Vietnam and leave the Vietna mese people to run their own country." Geneva agreements on Vietnam (1954) prohibited the introduction of foreign troops and military personnel and the establishment of military bases under the control of a foreign state. They laid down the holding of free elections by secret ballot. Torture, b@mbsB qus The resolution of the meeting, moved by Mr. R. Rose (senior vice- president, Newcastle Branch Water- side Workers' Federation), deplored: the use of torture, napalm and phos phorus bombs and gases; the attacks on North Vietnam and the Austra lian Government's sunnnrt fnr America's intervention. Mr. R. Rose was to nave attended the International Trade Union soli darity in Hanoi (see below) but was refused a visa by the Australian Government. Last Saturday's demonstration was jointly organised by prominent church leaders and the Newcastle Trades Hall Council. The march down Hunter Sti'eet was headed by these church leaders and officials of the THC. An earlier attempt by the Bishop of Newcastle to use the "red bogey" only succeeded in bringing more clergymen into the public protest. The marchers, representing a wide section of the trade unions, students, the Union of Australian Women and private citizens carried banners de nouncing the war in Vietnam. The demonstration received wide local television and press coverage in cluding the British Broadcasting Commission which has cameramen in Newcastle doing a special docu mentary.
