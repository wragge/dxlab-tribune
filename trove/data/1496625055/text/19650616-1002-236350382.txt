 No "Tory Party in Prayer" says Bishop kJEWCASTLE: The Rev. Bishop Moyes, former Bishop of Armidale, received a stand ina ovation from more than 350 people when he rose to speak at Tyrell House on the need for negotiations to end the Vietnam war, last Wednesday night. Bishop Moyes explained his reason for initiating the Bishops letters to Menzies which condemned Australian participation in the war and called for negotiations to bring the war to an end. "Many people would have been surprised at these letters," he said, "because they think of the Anglican Church as the Tory Party in prayer." He said that this had never been his conception of the function of an Angli can with a social conscience. He stressed the need for critical voices always to be heard on issues such as those concerning peace and . war and he deplored the lack of op- portunity afforded such voices by the Menzies Government's denial of Parli amentary discussion on the sending of troops to Vietnam. Bishop Moyes said that the Menzies Government must be convinced by the will of the people that it should negotiate over Vietnam. Australia's future heritage was in volved and our friendship with the Asian people and we should not be at war with them, he said. The Bishop as well as the support ing speakers Mr. A. W. James MHR and Mr. J. Comerford showed concern over Australia's attitude toward our Asian neighbours and the bad name it was earning for us. Mr. James said we had to learn to live peacefully with Asians as part of Asia and we could not afford to support American Foreign policy in Asia. Mr. Comerford challenged Menzies to discuss with the UN General Sec retary, U Thant the holding of free elections in Vietnam. Chairman of the meeting was Pro fessor Jeffery Tanner Lecturer in Classics at the Newcastle University.
