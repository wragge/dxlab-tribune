 South African Rugby team in Australia Labor Council says "NO" to racism $YDNEY: The NSW Labor Council last Thursday greet ed the arrival in Australia of the South African Ruabv Union (Springbok) team by reaffirm ing its opposition to South African racial discrimination â€” socially, politically, industrially and in sporting bodies. The Council Secretary (Mr. J. Ken ny) said that 350 people had been executed in the past 12 months in South Africa for opposing the Govern ment's policies. Council had been asked to call tor a boycott of the Springbok team, by the Central Council of the Miners' Federation. Earlier the New Zealand Federation of Labor called on the trade union movement of that country to ooycott all games to be played m New Zea- ! land. Mr. W. Parkinson (general president Miners' Federation) said he thought a boycott would be effective if organ ised with determination. Pointing to the feeling of the Aus tralian workers against apartheid he said that the Australian Council of Trade Unions had strongly condemned South African racialism and had dis tributed a list to aid the victims in that country. "The Miners' Federation had also struck a special levy," he said. Mr. Kenny speaking against the boy cott proposal, said that previous boy cotts organised by the trade union movement did not have the successes they should have had. "We hope that the footballers will go back and tell their people the feel ing of the Australian workers "I do not believe that all members of the team support the Government's racist policies," he said.
