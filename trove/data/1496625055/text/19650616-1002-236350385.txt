 Bra TH!S is a page for open discussion by members of the trade union and labor movement. Recently there have been State conferences of the Labor Party as well as a meeting of the central com mittee of the Communist Party of Australia. In August comes the ALP Federal conference, and in September the "Parliament of the trade unions" — the Aus tralian Council of Trade Unions Congress. Immediately after that is Australia's first international trade union gathering — the South Pacific conference on nuclear weapons and the French tests. Many important political and economic issues will be the subject of controversy in this period — on the jobs, in the unions and other organi sations of the working peoole No doubt this discussion, the advocacy of improved policies, the criticism of ex isting policies, will be re flected in a number of trade union and labor movement Journals. Tribune sees its responsi bility, as the only national weekly organ of the working class movement as a whole, to serve and assist this dis cussion throughout Austra lia. Readers are invited to contribute, and to interest their fellow workers to read and contribute to this nage. Orders for extra copies of 'Tribune should reach 168 Day Street, Sydney, not later than Tuesday noon, each week.
