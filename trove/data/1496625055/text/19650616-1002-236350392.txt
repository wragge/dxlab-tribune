 Conference demands: More federal money for education ANBERRA: Four major weaknesses of the present- day education system were qiven by Professor W. Connell, Professor of Education at Syd ney University, to the National Education Conference. Professor W. Connell was a guest at the conference, which was organised by the Australian Teachers' Federa tion. It attracted 80 delegates from 50 national and state organisations. About 200 observers and visitors at tended. Professor Connell said the weak nesses were:â€” Lack of overall planning. Lack of adequate social educa tion. The undue weight given tq ex ternal examinations. Inadequacies in teacher training, the pivot on which the world of educa tion swines. Prof. Connell said that Australians are under-educated compared to other highly developed countries. For ex ample, in the U.S.A. 60% of the 15-19 year age group are engaged in full time education; in the U.S.S.R. 49%; while in Australia only 20% of this age group are receiving full time education. In discussion, delegates stressed the need for over-all planning of educa tion from the pre-school to tertiary levels, including technical education; and on the need for the Federal Gov ernment to take a much larger share of financial responsibility for educa tion. It was pointed out that State Gov ernments are faced with an increasing demand for educational facilities with which they cannot possibly keep pace unless are provided with more finance by the Federal Government for the purpose. However, despite the widespread nature of the organisations represent ed at the Conference, the Prime Min ister again showed his arrogance and lack of concern for education, needs, by refusing to meet a deputation from the Conference. The Conference unanimously called on the Commonwealth Government to immediately grant funds to enable States to allocate - increased finance for education, particularly teacher training.
