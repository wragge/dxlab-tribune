 Mr. Hawke s opposition to conscription pERTH : Opposing the con scription of young Austra lians for the Vietnam war, State Opposition leader A. R. G. Hawke has exposed the cynical expediency of US intervention in the affairs of other coun tries â€” according to whether the oeople's choice is a rightist or leftist government. In "The West Australian" oi June 3, Mr, Hawke said: "The Menzies Government has decided that young Australians shall be conscripted and sent to the battle areas. The justification offered by the Government is that it is better to fight the menace of armed Commun ism in Vietnam than to take the risk of having to fight against it in areas closer to Australia "That argument over-simplifies the confused issues of the total Vietnam situation. "American: advocates ot armed in tervention in the conflict by the U S. have claimed the people of Vietnam should be left free by the Communists and by all outside nations to choose by free election the type of govern ment they wish to possess. "I have a recollection that at a free election in Argentina a few years ago a big majority of the people voted for the Peron candidates. Their free choice was defeated because the ruling Rightwing clique declared the free election results to be illegal "No nation', not even 'the U.S., then thpught of going to war to rescue the free elebtiori rights ?bf 'the Argen- 'tinfe people. Other similar instances could be cited."
