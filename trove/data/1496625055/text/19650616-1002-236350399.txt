 The Clancy Bros., Ireland's Own THE CLANCY BROTHERS and Tommy Hakem have made a number of records of scores of Irish songs of all kinds. They know what the songs mean, the history, the atti tudes, the wisdom . . . that's what makes them so good to listen to. On "The Rising of the Moon" they sing songs of Irish rebellion and revolution, including master pieces "Roddy McCorley" and "The Wind that Shakes the Barley". They know the songs were sung by live men, and sing them so they come alive again. Maybe they've made a fortune out of it, but they're putting it back into the soul of their country. Songs like "Rosin the Bow", "Bard of Armagh" are the original tunes of "Men of the West" and "Streets of Laredo" — songs right from the source of Ireland's his tory. They laugh and taunt at the 400 years' contempt for Irish cul ture . . . they are throwing it back in the faces of the execu tioners. ; A serious way to put it, isn't? But I believe its true. The Clancy Brothers (Tom, Pat and Liam) come from Carrock on Suir, Tipperary, in the south of Ireland. Tommy Makem is from Keady, County Armagh, in ' the north. "We don't recognise that border," he says. Pat and Tom were in the RAF during the war. They say: "The Nazis were in human; that's why they were everyone's enemies." They migrated to Canada, where Tom . worked as a baker, and Pat as a house painter. They worked in theatre as actors and singers when they could get work. Anyone making unnecessary noise at their concerts will be quietened with: "Will ya for the Christ's sake shut up!" — or some other polite phrase. Their respective repertoire of Irish songs must run into hundreds. They sing songs from everywhere and have made a version of the Aus tralian shanty, "South Australia."
