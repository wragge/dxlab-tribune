 LOCAL McCA.RTHYITES At the same time comes a baying cry from the Liberal "ultra-rights" the NCC and the RSL hierarchy, calling.. for a Government White Paper to "expose" all those who dare question the senseless and doomed Vietnam war policy of the bovernment. This "exposure", however, would certainly rebound on its authors. Even in 1950, Menzies' ill-starred effort to "expose" Communist activity ended in his crushing defeat in a national referendum. Today, however, the situation is even more difficult for the local McCarthyites. The American war on Vietnam is so unjust, cruel and hopeless that virtually the whole Australian labor movement stands opposed to Australia's involvement; and wide circles of churchmen, academics and other citizens have publicly declared a similar view. Are all of these hundreds of thousands going to be "isolated" and "exposed"? An accounting there will have to be over the Vietnam war. It will be found that the criminals who deliberately set Australia on a course of military collision with our Asian neichbors are among the present Government and its apolo gists. Australian history knows no parallel to the dire public condemnation they are now earning and will inevitably suffer.
