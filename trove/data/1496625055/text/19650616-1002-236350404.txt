 I I TRIBUNE Who are the guilty ones? gEFORE concerning himself with the "murky shadow" over S.E. Asia, Sir Robert Menzies might well give attention to one already spreading over Australia. Recently, several organs of the daily press erupted with a campaign against communists because of a pamphlet recently published, condemning the Government for decid ing to send troops to Vietnam. .Jhis was said to be "aimed against the soldiers" and "to'Tntimidate soldiers' families". . Nameless "army officers" were referred to as sources of alleged statements against '"enemies" who distributed such leaflets, etc. One paper (the Daily Telegraph) claimed the Com munists had distorted the caption of a photograph. All of these statements were false. That is serious indeed when their implications of "treason" -were being made — an 'offence which may bring the death penalty under the Australian Crimes Act "whether or not the existence of a state of war has been declared". - It emerged that the only intimidation of soldiers' fami lies was that being practised by these very newspapers which devoted "scare" headlines to the subject without any founda tion in fact whatever. If we asume that the nameless "army officer" inform ants are not press inventions, then the Menzies Government is duty bound to discipline these individuals who have violated Queen's Regulations by communicating to the Press information calculated to damage the morale of soldiers and their families — and false, into the bargain.
