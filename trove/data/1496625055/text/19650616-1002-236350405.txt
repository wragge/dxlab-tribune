 Women campaign against high prices C YDNEY : Concerned at steep instant and creeping price increases of foodstuffs, particu larly meat and other essential commodities, the Union of Aus tralian Women will move for a joint effort with trade unions and other organisations for a campaign to control prices and lift wages. National se '.ary of the UAW, Mrs. Freda Brown, said last week that the Communist Part. five point program for better living con ditions conformed to the aims of the UAW campaign. The five point campaign launched by the C" munist Party is: A £22 basic wage as a family livi-ig /age, with margins adjusted in accordance with the.. 194.'? standards. Control of prices. A 35 hour week. Equal pay without discrimin ation of sex or race. Abolition of anti union penal clauses. A survey made by the UAW into prices and wages about two years ago disclosed that a living wage of from £22 to £28 was essential, and prices have continued to soar since then. Federal price control is one of the demands of the UAW arid a petition has been circulated in solme States calling on State Governments to initiate a Premiers' Conference to discuss granting power necessary for Federal price control. They are seeking a Joint trade union deputation to present these petitions with thousands of names to State Governments. The UAW also wishes to discuss with the trade unions, as well as prices, deceptive packages and shoddy services. In talks with the unions they will discuss the need for a committee of women and trade unionists to oe established to police and check prices. Their campaign for price con trol and a real living wage already has the support of the Canberra Trades and Labor Council and the i Broken Hill Industrial Council.
