 | British migrants' | I angry display I ! Tribune Correspondent j j PERTH: On Monday of last week 30 British I | migrant bricklayers and 14 wives demonstrated j | outside the Perth offices of John Spire, Public Relations Director of the Clay Brick Manufac- J | turers' Association, in protest against unemploy- j Iment and the false "rosy" picture presented to J intending migrants in Britain. | 1 CJOME of the demonstrat- j ing wives spoke to Tri- I bune of the serious hard- j ships they had faced since j arriving in Australia. s For many, work had been fitful | — a few days' or weeks' work — I then registering for unemploy- 1 ment benefit and the long three 2 weeks' wait to receive it. | Evictions or notices to move ! from Migrant Hostels because I they have outstayed their time j or cannot pay their accounts, j The frantic search for alternate accommodation, with landlords i demanding two weeks' rent in | advance plus a bond of £15. 1 In one migrant family with I two young girls, the husband had j to go to the country for a job. I The wife was served with notice to get out by the Migrant Hostel. 8 With the first pay she had re- ) ceived for many weeks, she had | to fork out to the new landlord g all but £2, which was suppose! 1 to buy food and other necessities | till the next remittance from her J husband. She and her children | were hungry. | . Another family had to live on I chips for a week. The story | goes on. The daily press has | been given these facts. Why 1 haven't they printed them? | J In 1964 alone, 120 assisted I bricklayers arrived in WA. Since I January, unemployment and fit- I ful employment amongst brickies 2 has worsened. g In spite of warnings from the 8 Bricklayers' Union, the Clay | Brick Manufacturers' Association | went ahead with the recruitment, f of brickies from Britain, sending I rj Jonn spire as their agent. \ I As one migrant expresses it: g | "Why does the Government allow I | an organisation such as the Clay | i Brick Manufacturers of WA i I authority to recruit and sponsor I bricklayers for WA when the de- I mand had reached saturation j point months ago? g "This form of propaganda j which is being fed into the | I British Press should be killed | j immediately. Intervention by I | the State should be demanded I | immediately in order to check 2 I the discontent which is spreading | | throughout the workforce of f | bricklayers. | f "This situation has compelled j J many teams of Contract Brick- I layers, including our own, to I seek employment in the East, | where wives, families and homes | have to be dropped, like so much | garbage, after being" 'bamboozled' ! into coming 12,000 miles for a I better way of life." (In the pryst j | six months, 40 bricklayers have ! g gone East.) I I The Union advises that the ( | Association has agreed to desist | in bringing out any more men 8 | than the 14 signed up now in I B Britain. j j A Union official said: "In the 8 j campaign to bring these facts I j to light, we had to turn to the | I women. It was they who helped g | most of all in the recent 8 ! struggle. The women now under- I I stand in a real way what their I men are fighting for." The Union | j has now decided to form a I Women's Committee to meet i | migrants and assist in their 2 | assimilation. . ... |
