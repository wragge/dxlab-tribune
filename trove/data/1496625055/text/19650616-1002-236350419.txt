 [?] I IIIBIIII HITIWI—III I Him III WMHMBW | VIETNAM — Inside Story J ! of the Guerilla War — by | I Wilfred Burehett. g I The author lived with the guer- | illas for 8 months. After the first | | few pages I was living with them 1 I too. This book is absolutely ! fascinating. I I Who could believe that the 1 (guerillas actually live "integrates I with the enemy" 6 miles from | j Saigon. Burehett, despite his 52 1 j years, took it all in his stride— j j he went on forced marches, ran j for cover from helicopter at- tacks, crept through the fabulous I system of underground tunnels j as battles raged. In short, he shared the life oi I the incredible Liberation fighters 8 I who are defeating far superior | j military forces. | j The guerilla leaders .wiJh whom i ! he makes you familiar know that j I they will defeat the enemy. ! j Therefore the final line in the | | book regarding the Americans j j makes sense. ! | "The best thing they can do is I | to go home." g ! j THE BIG CRUSH, by Fete j Thomas, 2/- (2/5 post- j ed). j j This small booklet traces the I j history of the Colonial Sugar I J Refining Co.

It is therefore 2 more important than usual for g us to have a clear idea of the j main questions involved. 8 PHILOSOPHY, A Guide | to Action for the Common ! Man, 2/6 (2/11 posted), j A realty large book on philoso- j I phy would deter many of us. 8 JThis little book, however, g I creates a different impression. ! It IS philosophy for the ordin- I ary man— as the book states in g j the first line, "philosophy is the ! |- study of the world, reality, as a I I whole." | This in itself is a fairly simple ! concept and the book goes on to I I explain lucidly the idea of philos- 2 j ophy as a guide to action. g I wihat is important is that it I g explains, simply and clearly, how I philosophy becomes an instru-, g ! ment for changing the world.
