 The rise of the new Luftwaffe I The USA f rains J German pilots 1 for N- war "T"HE US Air Force is training 500 Luftwaffe pilots to drop nuclear bombs, the US magazine Newsweek admits. Meanwhile, In Europe, the West German Government continues to press its pliant NATO allies to sup port its demands to be given these weapons. Political leaders, including West German Government members, clamor for a "return" to Germany of Polish and Czechoslovak territory handed to their rightful owners after Hitler's defeat. Newsweek says the 500 German airmen are being trained at a base near Phoenix, Arizona. They want war To avoid publicity, their planes carry no Iron Crosses or any other insignia. The Germans dress like Americans. "But blue eyes still sparkle at the prospect of combat and young pilots still dream of Iron Crosses" says Newsweek. The commander, General Aldin- ger, boasts that these pilots are "just as good as the old ones"— meaning, of course, the ones who bombed London and devastated other European cities. The German general also claims the pilots need "a little more exercise etcetera etce tera etcetera"— meaning some fight ing. An American instructor says the airmen have the old tradition of blind obedience: "I could take three of these boys in tow and fly straight into the side of a mountain and they would pile up right behind me." At a ceremony last week— 25 years after the evacuation of Dunkirk under German air attack— "the suc cessors of the dive-bombing, beach- strafing Stuka pilots were made hon orary citizens of Arizona" reports Newsweek.
