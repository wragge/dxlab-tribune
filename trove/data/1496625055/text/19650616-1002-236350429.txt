 Woof and Basil workers want £3 industry allowance SYDNEY: Two hour stopwork meetings of Wool and Basil Work ers' Union members were held in Sydney and Melbourne last week in support of £3 a week mdustry al lowance. The Sydney meeting of 350 mem bers of the union's N.S.W. Branch narrowly rejected a proposal to con tinue the stoppage for 24 hours. The meetings in both cities decided to hold further stoppages to consider the results of a conference with the employers on June 29. The meeting in Sydney also con demned the proposal of the Askin Government to abolish the jury system in motor damages claims. The Government's move was des- ( cribed as a "blatant attack on the j long established democratic rights of the people and an attempt to protect j the profits of the wealthy insurance I companies." g Printed , and published by.
