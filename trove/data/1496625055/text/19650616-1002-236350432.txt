 A "Billy Barker" donates to Tribune By JUNE MILLS um-IUMJWU» wuwa LJLKWWB TRIBUNE FUND COME time ago I mentioned Paddy O'Dea, a pensioner of Cairns, as a regular donor to Tribune Fund. I said Svdnev people would not know Paddy personally. However, there are two Sydney readers, Phyllis and John Johnson, who do know Paddy. They say he is a real "Billy Borker" at yarning. Phyllis writes about Pat's efforts with other unionists to form a "girls' union" at Charleville 64 years ago. "Women are better organised today than their grandmothers," he told them, women drudged like bullockies in hotel and board house jobs, so the unionists got the girls together when they put on a "blue" and helped them start their own trade union. No wonder, with past experiences like this, that Paddy O'Dea contributes to Tribune Fund. I've also been gently chided by a friend from Kings Cross for not mentioning Les, that devoted Tribune seller who collects for the Fund each week, sending the donations in the name of Kings X Donors and Dom. Gate. His efforts are much appreciated. Some donors this week may not be mentioned because of the holiday. They'll be acknowledged next week. This week's donations take the total to almost £2,200: M. Shadwell 5/-, Fred (per K.S.) £1; D.R.A.Y. £100. Per Butch Wharton: G. Mulholland £1, Malay 10/-, Another 4/-, Collection 11/-, Andrea £1.
