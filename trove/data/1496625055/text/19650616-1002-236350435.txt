 [?] With Tribune's Industrial Roundsman 1A/HILE Menzies was in New York talking about the "murky shadow" that would spread if America didn't stand fast to defend "freedom" in Vietnam, the press was reporting a further possible bloody struggle for power among the Soipth Viet namese generals. The "resignation" of Premier Phan Huy Quat brought to an end the eighth "government" formed in South Vietnam (without election) since Diem was "done away with" by the Yanks in 1963. At the same time American colum nist, Walter Lippmann, was sounding a warning that President Johnson's foreign policies "stupefies" Europe. Menzies on the other hand is STUPEFYING the world. ? AN electrician on the Qantas Hotel building job in Sydney decided to snatch it for a better- paid job. The boss got to hear of it, and told him that these firms who over pay their employees soon go out of business. "So why not stay with us where the pay isn't as good, but at least you've got job security!" ? fpHERE are a lot of stories on the waterfront about foremen who sack wharfies at the drop of a hat , . . but this one takes the cake. The other day a foreman from the Central Stevedoring Company in Sydney sacked a gang over a wool dispute and they received two days' suspension. They were the foreman's three Brothers, Uncle, Cousin and his only Son. As wharfies say: "Not even blood Is thicker than company policy!" ? TAURIE SHORT and his Iron- workers' National Conference decision to back Menzies' policy on Vietnam has stirred up a further wave of protests from jobs in Sydney. Now ironworkers at the State Office Block job have condemned the deci sion and called on FIA leaders to support the policy of the ACTU and the Labor Party opposing foreign troops in Vietnam. Workers say their right-wing leaders didn't forget to support Menzies, or to put the union dues up by 25 per cent. . . . but they did forget to tell the membership that they had in creased the wages of all officials by Â£3 a week.
