 [?] | LIFE-SAVING, MOVEMENT jj j Insurance firms J i can save lives I ! By "THE CHALLENGER" j| j gVERY year during Aus- | tralia's long hot sum- j mer, hundreds of surfers i are saved from drowning i by lie courageous mem- bers of the numerous | (though not numerous I enough) surf life saving | clubs, which are to be j found at most of the main j beaches. | The young life savers not only | jeopardise their lives in the surf I (including shark attacks), but to | top it all they do it all for nix. J ' That these young men are a ! great benefit to the public is | readily acknowledged, but what j is overlooked is the great bene- | fit they are also to big business. J The following article from the S Cook's Hill News bears this point | out: | "While surf life saving clubs | and local government bodies | struggle to provide facilities at I beaches and protection for J surfers, the life insurance com- I panies, which benefit greatly | from this activity, : considerably 1 increased their business and j their assets during 1964. | "The Prudential Assurance Ltd. | wrote £939 million worth of new j assurance last year. The Austra- I lian Mutual- Provident Society's | life assurance cover has trebled | in the last ten years. J "The Norwich Union. Life In- I surance Society wrote record j new business of more than £267 ! million last year, while the | Mutual Life and Citizens' Assur- Iance Co. Ltd. achieved a new record for every month. "The T. & G. Mutual Life Society had a record year, the total sums assured being just under £90 million. . | "Section 84 of the Fire Brigades 1 Act provides that three-quarters 2 of the amount to be spent by J the Fire Brigades Board in each | year shall be contributed by the insurance companies. | "A similar contribution should = be made to the surf life saving I movement " | Rugby League | By JIM SHARROCK. | ""pHE "match of the day" be- | tvveen Balmain and South | Sydney at the Sydney Sports £ Ground on Sunday saw Balmain. I in a well-deserved win, run out I the winners by 20 to 7. I The decisive points scoring | was in the goal kicking depart- ! ment. | This put Balmain on top and they never gave Souths a chance. ? With half of the competition I over, the prospects of the team:: | and where they stand at the | present are:— ? St. George (14 points, leaders' Still a first-class team, th | _ hardest of all to beat, i North Sydney (13 pts.): A ver I good team, showing some firs I . class displays. Will be right ir. j the thick of it at the finish. I South Sydney (\2 pts.): Started | bad then came good. Fast bir | light. Can raise the flags high j when in top gear, but find it I hard to be consistent, j Balmain (11 pts.): One of the | most improved teams in the last j couple of weeks. If they keep i&!| II hard to beat. I f Newtown (11 ptsi): Consistent || triers; displayed real grit to beat g 1 Norths after being well down at f 1 half-time on last Saturday. Not I B to be taken cheaply. 2 1 Parramatta (9 pts.): Started ! 1 very badly— despaired of by I m even their own supporters— but j 111 then came good with a big bang. | if If they retain their form and will 11 to win, will have a lot of other 2 M teams scratching to reach the f If semi-finals. | m Canterbury (8 pts.): Started j I by .winning four matches, then | went bad. Still a possibility, but j If it will need to return to early form. f'9 Wests (6 pts.): A leading team If in past seasons; still capable of if surprising. Will need to be on 11 the right foot all the time if they p are to have a chance. J || Manly (4 pts.): Looked good | 1 at start. Little or no chance of | || making the semi-finals from this ' 11 position. Still capable of mak- I 1 ing some very good displays. I if Easts (2 pts.): At the bottom j | of the list. No chance of making 11 the: semi-finals, but could upset | If on the day some of the top | if ' teams. I 9 Even at thiis stage I would not ( fg care to predict who will be the I If first four to enter the semi-finals, 2 fl With so many teams with a ! i chance, all matches are going to j if be keenly contested. There will j w be no room for loss of form or. j i taking it easy by any of the j « teams, and even those around I If the bottom of the list could i| easily upset some of the leading 11 teams on the day. | We will be looking forward to If some very keen and well-con- m tested football — with, I believe, If many surprises. I South Africa I JECENT statements by the as- 1 sistant manager of the South f African Springboks, Mr. Hennie ? . Muller, infer that the purveyors of the South African govern- % ment's racialist apartheid policy strive. to work it (apartheid) to j C| its utmost both at home and ? m abroad for their own advantage. I M After, last Saturday's first | m Rugby Test at Sydney, in which j || the Springboks were quite heavily j |1 penalized by the referee, the I |i manager and assistant manager j M of the Springboks interpreted j || the penalties as Australian objec- ! || tion to South Africa's racialist | || Apartheid policy. j || Mr. Muller has been reported ? || as saying that the Rugby field j | was being used as a smoke j | screen behind which political j | feelings were vented. ? | Whether or not the South Afri- I | cans see the actions of the j | referee and the playing of the j m game in this light is purely their j g own interpretation and probably | 1 indicates a fairly guilty consci- j H ence of their own approach to , H politics and sport. ! B On the other hand, the stand j 1 if the Australian Labor anu j a youth movements is one of direct = a opposition to Apartheid &na i | leaves no room for mis-inter- | 1 pretation by the South Africans. | 1 It is a stand that makes no bones s on the matter and calls on at | those opposed to racialism j boycott the games. j| II p
