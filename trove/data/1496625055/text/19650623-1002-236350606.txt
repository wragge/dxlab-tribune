 [?] By June Mulls \A/ITH only one more issue of Tribune before the end of June, £200/12/- would be needed to reach £2500 — £1000 more than our target set for the first six months of this year. Perhaps its expecting too much to raise £200/12/. in a week, but maybe with an extra special effort we could come close to this and what a splendid achievement it would be. You will nottce that Butch Wharton's name is missing this week — that's because he has been ill. I'm sure you all join with me in wishing Bulcn a speedy recovery.
