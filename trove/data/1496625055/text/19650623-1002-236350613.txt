 First aid f)N April 22, during morning tea break, a girl fainted in the dining room of a work establish ment next door to the Rachel rorsier nospnai, Jtteaiern. The firm's first aid man rendered ".ecessary assistance, while some- jody else inquired at the Hospital, >ut doctors would not leave. However, the girl would have leen received as a patient if the irm could, without a stretcher, iave managed to carry her to the lospital. This seems like evasion of res ponsibility. Eventually the ambulance ar- ived and took the patient to South Sydney Hospital. â€” Can we not force capitalism to o better than this. First Aid (Sydney).
