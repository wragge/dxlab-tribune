 Drought and Dr. Bradfield £|ECAUSE of my respect for the knowledge possessed by Mr. W. Mountjoy about everything to do with water conservation I was greatly concerned by his article on the Bradfield scheme for the irrigation of central Australia. I would be interested " to: know whether the Snowy River scheme which, like the Bradfield scheme, in volves the turning of a coastal river'.'" waters inland, has come up against the problem of evaporation which Mr. Mountjoy, along with the ex perts he quotes, sees as a fatal bar rier to the success of the Bradfield plan. It would also be interesting to know whether the irrigation projects of the central Asian Republics of the USSR have contributed any help ful knowledge on this question. More than once I have seen them quoted as examples of what could be done in Australia. — Dehydrated (Sydney)
