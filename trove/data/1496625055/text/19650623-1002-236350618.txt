 Unions call wage claims SYDNEY; Several Federal unions this week asked the Australian Council of Trade Unions to step up the cam- paign to win wage and annual leave demands for Common wealth- Government workers. A RECENT mass meeting at Garden Island Dockyard in Sydney and workers in many other Government establishments through out Australia have expressed strong hostility at the long delays in meet ing their claims. A conference of unions was called by the ACTU in October, 1963, to discuss claims amounting to about 51 items. These included: increased wages, margins, increment payments, in creased appretices' rates, four weeks' annual leave and improved workers' compensation. A joint approach was also made to the government for four weeks' leave by the ACTU, the Australian Council of Salaried and Professional Associations and the High Council of Commonwealth Public Service organisations. Representations were made to the Public Service Board last year. These resulted in some gains be ing made in shift rates and incre mental payments. The new incremental payments meant that tradesmen received an increase of 27/6 over the old scheme after three years' service and non- tradesmen 11/-. Previously there was no discrimina tion in payments for skill or classi fication. This has caused widespread re sentment throughout government establishments. Workers are also demanding that something be done about the claim for four weeks' annual leave. A recent meeting of the federal executive of the Postal Workers' Union asked that the A.C.T.U. call a meeting of unions to discuss this, demand.
