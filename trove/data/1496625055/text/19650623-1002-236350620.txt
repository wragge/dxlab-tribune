 [?] "gMPACT" (Channel 2, Syd ney, Tuesday, 9 pm ) is often well worth looking at. "The Strangers" on June 15 was a particularly good program. This was a documentary film on Britain's problem concerning ' the growing number of coloured immigrants. The film dealt with the recent Act to limit Commonwealth immi gration, the problem of housing and the many and varied jobs perform ed by the migrants showing their willingness to work on the most menial to some of the most es sential. A great deal was made of the alarm and puzzlement felt by the British on realising they had a col our problem but the most vital question — ignorance and prejudice — was not in my opinion sufficiently examined. A READER recently questioned the column's favourable review of "Hootenanny" (Channel 10, Sunday 5.10 p.m.). He said that prominent American folk singers had been banned from this programme because of the con tent of their songs. If this is true it is to be deplored. However, it is curious , that such progressive songs as "Blowing in the Wind", "Go Tell it on the Mountain" and others, have been sung repeatedly and 'on occasions by. Negro singers who brought a very personal feeling to these freedom songs. If Mr. Allen has more details con cerning this programme I'd be pleased if he would write to me care of Trib une. This programme also contains much, satirical comment on many aspects of modern American life. # =& # If you missed the series "Mr. Justice Duncannon" when it first appeared on Channel 2, it is now being repeated on this Channel at 6.30 p.m. each Monday. It is a gently humorous show, writ ten by Muir and Norden ("Take it from Here") and stars Andrew Cruick- shank of "Dr. Findlay's Casebook". Eileen Allison
