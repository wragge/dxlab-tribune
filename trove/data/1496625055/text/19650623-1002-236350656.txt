 PROTEST ON CONSCRIPTION FOR OVERSEAS gYDNEY : The Save Our Sons movement has called for a National Day of Protest on the day that conscrinted hovs report to the army in the various States. In Sydney on Wednesday, June 30, SOS will conduct an all-day (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.) vigil at the Addison Road, Marrickville, Army Depot, where con scripts have been told to report. "The movement invites all mothers to join i,n this Silent Protest against conscription of boys into regular army units which will be sent to Vietnam," says the statement.' The vigil will be continued at Central Station from 7 p.m. till 8 p.m., when the troop train loaves the same day. All supporters are invited to attend. SOS says that many of these boys are being conscripted against their will and the desire of their parents. They are to be sent overseas to serve in a war described by commentators as "incredibly dirty," the statement continues. The boys so conscripted can be sent overseas for 4Â£ years after only six morPhs.' training. The Youth Campaign Against Con scription inserted a seven-column advertisement in last Saturday's "Australian" signed by 150 prospective conscripts. The boys say they oppose oversea conscription because "we believe we may be sent to fight in Vietnam in a war which is oppos2d by such world leaders as Pope Paul and thousands of the world's churchmen, the Prime Ministers of India and Canada and most of the world's governments, General de Gaulle and Senator Full- bright and millions of the world's citizens. "This would be a moral wrong and an unjust call upon our lives by the Government of our country." The YCAC has appealed for dona tions to help pay for another insertion of the advertisement.
