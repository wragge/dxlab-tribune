 UNIONS ! DEFEND I WAGES i BATTLE | CYDNEY: The NSW Labor Council last Thursday declared the unqualified right of workers "to seek the , highest wage rates possible for their labor. "The trade union movement will assert this right and assist in the continued struggles for improved wages and conditions," Council said. A resolution sponsored by the Syd ney Branch of the Boilermakers' Society drew attention to statements by metal trades employers and their representatives condemning over- award payments and disputes in support of these claims. Attack on unions Mr. C. Brown (assistant secretary of the Boilermakers' Society) said "the employers are not only prepar ing for an attack on the metal unions because of their industrial action in support of over-award payments, but are seeking to end the system of over-award payments. "The employers should be warned that if attempts are made to lower wages they will be confronted by the united labor movement of this State," he said. Council declared, as a first step to meet and resist these anticipated attacks "tnat award wage rates are only minimum rates and that the present position of over-award rates proves that award rates are inade quate and insufficient to meet the needs of the average worker's family and must be supplemented by over- award payments. "It also proves that industry can ifford to pay more than award rates," Council said. MR. C. BROWN ... the employers should be warned.
