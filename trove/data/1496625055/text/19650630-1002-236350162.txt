 Assistance /RISING out of a recent meet ing at the Olympic Hall, West Terrace, Adelaide, addressed by Senator J. L. Cavanagh, this com- mittee was formed to assist mi grants finding difficulty relative to obtaining citizenship. It is the practice of the present linister for Immigration to refuse 0 disclose to a rejected applicant he reason for his rejection. The previous Minister was pre- ared to reveal the reason if ap- roached by an M.H.R. or Senator n behalf of the rejected appli- ant. This- committee brings up the case r Mr. Steve Pappas, a Greek ,nigrantswho is 65 years of age. Anyone will ell you who knows him that he is a good worker and an inoffensive individual who has never caused any trouble either at union meetings or his place of work. No person granted righf of entry to this country and allowed to live here for five years should he re jected on the grounds of participa tion in lawful trade union or poli tical activity. We as a committee ask these ques tions: Is it wrong for migrants to take part in social, economic, poli tical and other activities? Can they freely express their opinion without fear of being in dicted? Can they become members of trade unions, and participate in their activity? Can they support, follow and be come members of any legal political party? Until migrants know the answer to these questions how can they feel free, and regard Australia as a free country in which to live? . (Mr.) T. J. Lucas, Secretary of Naturalisation Rights Committee, South Australia.
