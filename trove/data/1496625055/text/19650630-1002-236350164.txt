 0000000 The Menzies Govt. and ex-nazi war criminals in Australia |N a recent law court hearing jn Brisbane (Queensland), a jury found that a Brisbane newspaper's exposure of Georg Von Konrat was an ex-nazi war criminal was in the public interest. It did not award one shilling of a Â£100,000 claim Konrat made against the newspaper for defa mation of character. It is of great moral significance that despite this, we find that the Menzies Government remains silent about the many other ex- nazi war criminals row residing in Australia. The Commonwealth Government is directly responsible for these notorious criminals being allowed into the country to act detri mentally to our national welfare. Recent exposures In the Aust ralian press concerning . fascist activities show the urgent need for a complete investigation into their activities and their prompt removal from Australia, whether they are naturalised or not. Such organisations include the 30,000 - strong Ustashi, a semi- military trained organisation con taining many ex-nazi war criminal leaders; the Australian National Socialist Party; the Mafia, etc. The existence of such organis ations in Australia is sufficient proof that the Menzies. Govern ment is tp" mnsible for this state of affairs. I appeal urgently to all Aust ralian ex - servicemen, their kin dred organisations, as well as to all sections of '.cmocracy- loving people to do something about this. G. Mulholland, Newcastle (NSW)
