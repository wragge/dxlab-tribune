 | Is " Fail Safe" as j j safe as they say ? j j "WHAT is "Fail Safe"? j It is the point of pos- I sible attack for American j nuclear bombers alerted by j a UFO (Unidentified Fly ing Object) on their base ! radar screens. Once the bombers get to "fail ! safe" they are poised for a nuc- \ lear attack on Russia. 1 This film tells what could hap- \ pen if the bombers accidentally j pass "fail safe" and every pos- I sible means of recall is tried j and fails. j The pilot is hurtling towards j | Moscow. First the voice of his 1 | President, his . wife, beg him to j I turn round. j | His orders are to take notice j | of rio-one. | I "The enemy could imitate the j I- President's voice," and even his j wife. j I The President has no alterna- | j tive, he must prevent a nuclear j !' war even though Moscow will f be destroyed. | Why is the attack a mis- | j take? i I "Fail safe" shows the intri- j j cacy and complexity of the com- j puter-controlled war machine. I It says that if we automate I war, then the control of war | could get out of our hands. j Once the mistake, mechanical ( or not, has been made, nuclear apparatus moves too fast for j | men to handle. j I "Fail safe" brings up one argu- | | ment after the other for man j | against war. j I The nuclea; professor plays the = I game of nuclear chess giving and I j taking twenty million casualties j ! in one breath. j | He- says that if New York is , i destroyed it would be no use dig- j j ging for people, we must first j I look , for "the records of big cor- j I pora tions." 1 I Who does the professor work | ! for? The Government or the j | corporations? j j ; "Fail Safe" shows the mental I | preparedness of the U.S. Air j j Force to wage total war. J j One colonel tries to take over j : the attack and refuses the Pre- | I sident's orders. _ j j "Fail Safe" shows how the war = j machine de-personalizes human I j relati ns. .1 I It shows the war chiefs waging j j war by radar, far out of touch | with the flesh and blood beneath | I the bombs. j | What it does not point out, is j j that the flesh and blood beneath = j the bombs must stop the military I | on- track mind and break the j I barriers down that cause feai j j and mistrust between different j social systems. ! I "Fail Safe" is being shown at j i Hip vipf.nrv Theatre in Sydney. 1 -D.K. I I nâ€” !
