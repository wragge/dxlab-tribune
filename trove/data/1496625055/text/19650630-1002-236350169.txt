 [?] [?] [?] - I - "THE GOLDEN HOLDEN" Is the story of General Motors in Australia. Based upon the Company's own publications the authors, George Zangalis and John Arrowsmith (both of whom have worked on the GMH assembly line) tell of those who have pocketed Â£15 million-odd profit over the years. They also answer the question: "Does foreign investment guarantee employment?" The take-over of Holdens Lt'd., and the buying but of all Australian shareholders in 1960 is part of the fascinating history. "The Golden Holden" is hot a 'knocker', it takes the facts as they are and points a positive way forward. George Zangalis, a post-war Greek migrant, has worked on the assembly line of several car factories. His natural, close links with other migrant workers in the car industry has equipped him well to tell of the hurry- up and shut-up attitude to workers in the industry by the employers. John Arrowsmith, has also worked on the assembly line. He has contributed articles on the car industry to working class journals for the last ten years.
