 Mother's Son He handed me the. letter, His eyes . were clouded,- Shaded by his slpjuch-. He said: His mother wrote. ' My fingers trembled On the note. Will someone write (it said) Someone who knew him, Someone to tell me, Was — there at the end? Her youngest son . . My best friend. i- How does a' soldier write it? Write truthfully. Tell her of his death? I wrote that I was sorry. To his mother .... I am sorry. I couldn't pen my misery, Or say that I wept. (But it is true I did, And cried bis name aloud.) I was twenty-one . . . , And very proud. I couldn't write of shrapnel, My arms about him, Bleeding through my hands- — Young blood — warm and thick. I simply wrote: It was quick. She wrote another letter. Her words were stumbling, Sullied by her grief; Words heavy with her pain: Please write to me .... Please write again. Just to have a letter Written by a soldier — Trom someone overseas. I became the chosen one— A youthful ghost . . . A ghostly son. I ghosted in the trenches And did my fighting; Writing when she wrote-- ; And wanting not to write. Wanting, wanting . . . Not to write. And hating mail parades. They came, the letters Written to. her son; Her son. But just the same The sergeant called .... My name. I wrote I'd call to see her When it is over; I thought to take her hands — We could talk about the kid; When it is over ... I never did. I find the years are mounting; I am growing older, As all soldiers must. The past is silent — yet — In the present ... I can't forget. I hear the brass band playing ' he lads are marching, i very one in step; n green, each like the other— \i yun9 soldier . With a mother. —RALPH KELLY
