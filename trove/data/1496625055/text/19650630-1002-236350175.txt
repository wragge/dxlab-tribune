 j I TRIBUNE I Warrior's retreat from London THE Commonwealth Prime Ministers conference in Lon- don, although rightly rebuffed over the Vietnam peace mission" maneouvre, made a significant contribution in its final communique to the ultimate solution of the Vietnam problem. The conference declared that the south Vietnam Libera-., tion Front 'should be represented in any peace talks on Vietnam. , . ; This marks an important departure from the United States and Australian Government positions and is clearly, in the main the result of pressure from the Afro-Asian- Caribbean majority among the 21 prime ministers. The Commonwealth decision on this matter is a rebuff To President Johnson, who has specifically ruled out nego tiations with the "Vietcong", though this has been repeatedly urged internationally and by nriany Americans, including such a noted figure as Senator Fullbright, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. And if it is a rebuff to Johnson, it is an outright defeat for Sir Robert Menzies, who told Parliament on April -7, with soecial reference to the NLF, that if he was the last Prime Minister in the world to oppose negotiations he would still oppose them.
