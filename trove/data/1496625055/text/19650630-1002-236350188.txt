 Postal workers' actioifi on wages CYDNEY: The Federal Executive of the Postal Workers Union last Friday in Sydney decided on industrial action if all cable join- ters are not given wage increases by July 7 The executive is demanding that all oable jointers receive £1239 a year and that jointers capable of performing more complex duties be paid £78 in excess of this amount A strong protest was made against the PJVTG Department and the Public Service Board for their decision that the majority of these cable jointers be placed on a rate of £1197 a year. Previously all these men (about 9,000) were on the same rate of pay. The decision of the Board means that only about one third will receive the new pay increase of £74 per year. It was decided that a deputation see the Director General of the j PMG (Mr. O'Grady) and he be : informed that unl js these demands are resolved by June 7, "then the organisation will embark on indus trial action without delay." The executive also decided that unless satisfactory negotiations are held with the department regard ing . shifts and rosters in the new Sydney Mail Exchange that the NSW Branch of the union call four hour stop work meetings. The Federal Executive instructed the NSW Branch executive to "face up to its obligations" to the mem bership and directed the branch to immediately enter fnto negotiat ions with the department on these matters. Spokesmen for the union say that the department is planning to introduce an eight hour shift on Saturday at the new mail exchange at Redfern. Normally the men were only asked to work a four hour shift. Workers say that mail officers are to be forced to work extended compulsory overtime.
