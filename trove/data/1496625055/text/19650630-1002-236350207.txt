O'BRIEN (Federal secretary, Australian Rail ways Union) said he was con cerned at the manner in which Mr. Whitlam "is urg ing interference in the in ternal affairs of trade unions, especially regarding the election of officials". &lt; "Propaganda of this nature is contrary to the policy of the ARU and the trade union movement. VI t can only advance the cause of the Liberal Party rnd the National Civic Council who want to weaken the influence of the trade unions." 7T kiR. R. SCOTT (assistant Federal secretary, Boil ermakers' Society) said Mr. Whitlam did not realise that the trade union movement is made up of a broad section of workers representing all varying political views.
