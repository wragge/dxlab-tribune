 A new target! By JUNE MILLS W h we nearly made it! The aim was to raise £1000 over the initial target of £1500 for the first six months. If we'd received just another £88/4/9 it would have made the £2500. Now we are off on the second half of the year; the very modest aim is reach £4,000 for the 12 months ending December 31. Only £1588/4/9 to go! With friends of Tribune like a; M. from Menzies in West Australia I'm sure we will easily reach this goal He wrote to (me this week about mutual friends in Perth and said: "You axe all doing a wonderful job for peace and the liberation of mankind."
