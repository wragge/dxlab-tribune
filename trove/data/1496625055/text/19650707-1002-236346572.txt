It may never have occurred to Senator Paltridge, that people of goodwill and academics in particular are very loth to be outspoken on an important and contentious ques tion unless they have meticulously examined all available facts, which are pertinent. The Senator is surely aware that the truth and the facts of which he speaks in relation to events in South Vietnam, have never been, substantiated by the Federal Gov ernment to a degree likely to im press thinking people. Indeed, much of the relative infor mation submitted to the Australian people, concerning this issue, has been based largely on political opinion. It is not a case of academics- and people of goodwill following the Communist line, or preserving the case for Hanoi and Peking as sug- gested by Senator Paltridge; it is rather more a matter of being objec tive by not closing one's eyes to the evidence arising from the facts, and' of recognising the truth that it is ' politically and morally wrong to send Australian troops to fight, against the revolution by the indi- ' genous people of Vietnam.
