 Treatment of new settlers RECENTLY while working as a waterside worker at 13 Pyr- mont, I was disturbed by the treatment accorded to new settlers arriving in our country by the shipping companies concerned, the Customs Department and the Maritime Services Board. These migrants with language difficulties were obliged to stand by for eight hours, some with small children in arms and at their side, in a filthy cargo shed waiting for their luggage to be cleared through customs. No washing or drinking facili ties were available and the toilets were in a filthy condition. Luck ily they were hard to find and squired much effort to reach. Waterside workers on the job did what they could to ease the ' migrants' difficulties. , I contacted the four Sydney daily tewspapers and asked them to send l reporter and photographer, to the ;ob to investigate the complaints. I pointed out that the daily pap ers were always ready to villify and misrepresent workers' attempts to improve their working conditions and that now they had a chance - to expose the extremely bad con ditions forced on new settlers on heir first day in our country. Each paper agreed to send a re- jorter down but did nothing. I suppose the incident did not pre sent a scare headline for their papers or even a par in their edi- f nn'Â«lc R. Mackerras, Sydney.
