 Bwvinsa socialist I> ll'lll Recently I purchased a statio wagon made in Czechoslovakia. Why' firstly, a great attraction is th( auOOO miles or four years guarantei Parts and Labour". This is better than any other ca: n the market. ' . . I also noticed in an FngiisV journal that the Skoda although "olc; lashioned" in some respects repres ented the best value for money a' the last British Motor Show. This is praise indeed. ' rvti, t00' cheaper than an; t:nifrTm class, and on investiga ion I was told that the last sale &lt;J,frease was "Absorbed" no lf/f &lt;0n' 1 went -ahead. . amnnnt trade-in' bomb and - cash to only £200. Instead oi bv thpT.?67 dep&lt; 1 was told balanpp6" 1 could Spread the Balance over "three or four months" All I did was to sign a P/N for the amount. No interest. Why such generous treatment? It is simple. The Czechs, like other socialist countries, send us goods for sale for the sole purpose of raising credit to purchase our wool or other com modities which they wish to buy. They are not. concerned with little bits of interest. This enables, them to undertake a real exercise in genuine public relations at a very low cost. The most important aspect of my purchase is, I believe, the fact that by buying socialist I bought a more Australian article than if I had bought a Holden, Falcon, Morris or any other of the so called "Austra lian manufactured" cars. No money whatsoever leaves the country or is ploughed back for fur ther investment. AH cash raised goes in the purchase of bur goods which is good for our development as it is money obtained without strings or conditions of any kind — true trade exchange. In view of the darkening economic sky we would do well to seek out 1 markets with the increasingly pros-' perous socialist economies and thereby avoid needless boom-or-burst, stop-gc methods of coping with trade cycies. .
