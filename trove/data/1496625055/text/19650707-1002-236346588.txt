 I Save Our Sons! I | pOLITICAL police of the Askin | Government's New South Wales | Special Branch roughly jostled | mothers peacefully demonstrating I at Sydney Central Station last i week against conscription of 20- | year-olds for overseas service. I The first Sydney call-up report- ! ed for service at Marrickville ! barracks lar Wednesday and that | night entrained for camp. I At both points the SOS (Save j Our Sons) movement of Sydney I mothers carried out a peaceful | demonstration vigil, displaying | banners opposing conscription for ! overseas service, with special j reference to the Vietnam war. j The 20-year-olds were friendly I to the demonstrators and in some J cases expressed support. | Even a uniformed policeman ex- | pressed sympathy with the demon- ! stration. j Daily Press interviews with Aus- | trali,an soldiers in Vietnam and | also with new conscripts report I that they rarely indicate support | for the Government's policy of in- | tervention. S In some cases, soldiers see over- | seas service only as a chance | to qualify for a war service home. I On Saturday, a Sydney city I street sample of young people's I opinions, taken by delegates to the j N.S.W. Conference of the Eureka ! Youth League, revealed that 43 per I cent of those questioned were op- i posed to sending Australian - | troops to Vietnam; 43 per cent | supported it; the rest were un- J decided. ' The survey showed that 74 per | cent of those interviewed opposed I the sending of conscriptees to j Vietnam and 13 per cent were in I favor. | Mr. P. George, E.Y.L. State I Secretary, told the conference that | opposition to the Government's ! Vietnam policy was growing. | Another poll held some weeks | ago indicated that only 37 per | cent opposed Australian involve- S ment. | The conference decided to send I deputations to a Federal cabinet g minister, or a suitable Federal ! Liberal member on Saturday, July | 24. j The League would challenge the j Prime Minister's "we are at war" f statement and other views at I every opportunity, the conference f said. | It called for the immediate with- g drawal of Australian troops, the | cessation of bombing of North' j Vietnam and the implementation | of the 1954 Geneva Agreement, I which included the withdrawal of I all foreign troops and the right j of the Vietnamese people to de- g cide their own future. I Conference called for repeal of t the National Service Act and re- f affirmed full support for Trade | Union Youth Week.
