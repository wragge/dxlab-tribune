 Honors to Sorge From RUPERT LOCKWOOD, in Moscow. "THE new Soviet film epic, "The Great Patriotic War", and military historians giving 20th anniversary victory ad dresses, paid tribute to the part played by a German Com munist, Sorge, in turning the nazi tide at Moscow in De cember, 1941. Sorge, whose help and martyrdom were never publicly acknowledged in Stalin's time, was a desperately needed ally m the dark days when the Wehrmacht plunged to Mos cow's outskirts, with a superiority over the Red Army of 80 per cent in artillery, 40 per cent in tanks, . 10 per cent in manpower and 2i times in planes. Sorge had contacts in the German Embassy in Tokio and the Japanese Cabinet apparatus. He warned Stalin of the impending Nazi inva sion of the USSR, but was not taken seriously. In the Battle of Moscow crisis, Sorge's firm assurances that the Japanese would not attack the Far East could not be ignored. With other correspondents, I was taken over the Mozhaisk battlefield, where Moscow was saved. Soviet military historians pointed out to us where the 82nd Motorised Division from the Far East, trans ferred after Sorge's coded message from Japan had made this transfer practicable, had stopped German tank and infantry waves. With further reserves pouring in from the Far East, the Red Army launched the counter-attack which sent the Germans reeling back 150 miles from Moscow and allowed humanity to breathe more freely; Cows grazed peacefully as we gazed over the Russian earth that enfolded the dead of General Guder- ian's panzer armies, for whom Hit ler had already struck Moscow oc cupation medals. (Hitler had even planned to submerge Moscow for ever in an artificial lake). Sorge, the German Communist, died on a Japanese gallows, arrested as he was about to send a message that could have shortened the Paci fic War and saved many Australian lives â€” the message that the Japanese Fleet was steaming for Pearl Harbor.
