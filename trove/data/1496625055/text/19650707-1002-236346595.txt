 Who is Snow? XA/HO is Snow? He's the bloke Bill Sutton talks to in 30 of his satirical sketches in a booklet entitled "SNOW AND ME". The sketches date from 1953 to November, 1964, and range from talks on.. Cuba, to patriotism, "Yankee Go Home", "Snow's Sour on Budget". In the foreword, Jim Henderson says: "After the phenomenal success of his booklet of short stories "Leave the Heads on 'Em", this latest booklet by Bill Sutton is assured of a warm welcome. "These sketches will make you laugh, but not laugh at the ordinary man, but with him, and win you to stand side by side with him in his struggles for a better life. "They are a valuable addition to the rapidly-growing working class literature of Australia." "SNOW & ME" is obtainable at New World Booksellers, 425 Pitt Street, Sydney. Price 2/6 a copy. â€” J.M.
