 ! Caff for I r a j international j i support | From W. £. COLLAN, ! ! in. Rome. - I I _ V m m „ -O I INFORMATION reaching I Home from Algiers now j j establishes beyond doubt j ) that the military coup j I ffeftat headed by Colonel f Boumedienne is a right- j wing counter-revolutionary I ! move, intended to prevent j | the further development f | of socialism an Algeria. j | What as known for certain is 1 | that there was opposition within I R the Political Bureau of the F.L.N. | I to Ben Bella's proposals for ex- ! | teneding socialist ownership of j | property to include Algerian as i | well as former French colonial- ! | 1st property, and also On other I I proposed measures to strengthen I I socialist developments. ! On Saturday, June 19, the Cen- I c tral Committee of the F.L.N. was I fi to have met, and would undoubt- i 1 edly have endorsed these propos- j als, following criticism of the | I slow pace of socialisation by a i | Congress of the trade union ! | movement. J I However, on the morning of | |j the 19th, the .militarist junta seiz- ed Ben Bella and instituted wide- I | spread arrests of the left forces j | in the F.L.N. j Boumedienne himself is an j | Islam extremist, strongly anii- j I -communist in outlook. . | 3 Hie army is holding Algiers in ! | force, but resistance by the trade 8 I unions and the youth quickly ap- g | peared in the capital, and more J j strongly in Oran and other cities. J J Numbers of the resistance forces J | have already been shot down by | 1 the army. I 1 Members of the Political j | Bureau and the Central Commit- | I tee who are pledged to a socialist S | Algeria are leading the under- j 1 ground struggle and the mass I = movement of resistance to the = I military dictatorship, for which | j there is little evidenee of public j ! support. j 8 The militarist leaders of the | | counter-revolutionary forces ap- ) = pear to be banking heavily on j | securing de facto recognition by ! | proceeding with the planned j | Afro-Asian Congress. (Subsequ- j J «ntly postponed — Tribune). | | Tlie resistance movement has I | already called for international S S solidarity of working class and ? B democratic forces in opposition I j to the military dictatorship. jj | Widespread and vigorous inter- j B national action is needed to assist ! | in preventing a savage reign of | | terror, and to restore the forces j ! of democracy and socialism to = \ power!
