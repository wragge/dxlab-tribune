 [?] JFTER. reading, the Communist Party booklet,. "Soviet Jewry" — a reply to- I. Leibler — I feel I can> make a contribution-, after rciiuiug, ixiir uiticic xcuciiwy uy ur. Frank Knopfelmacher. In- this article was; a reference to Dr. Knopf elmaeher's experiences in Czechoslovakia immediately after the socialist revolution. I interpreted this- reference as- meaning. that anti-Semitism' was practised officially, by the- Govern ment. It occurred' to me that what he- saw was not anti-Semitism,, but . the. process of. workers, taking, power from the capitalists. It is logical to assume that some capitalists were Jews and as. such- ,. were enemies of socialism,, as were tiler Gentile capitalist's. Now let us- look at the other side of the penny. In a capitalist' state, if a Jhwi'sh; worker is unemployed, evicted' from his- home or' treated/ to- any- of the other indignities: that, capitalism forces ori the workers, this too could' be construed as antii- Sfemitism. But it ik very strange that we- never hear of the; Knopf elmachers- or Lieblters condemning' this type, oft treatment of Jfews who happen to be members of the working class. R'.
