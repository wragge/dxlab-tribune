 When I was a lad with my lamp in my hat, I ma: handled coal from the face to the flat; Full twelve skips I loaded, and that was a must, For six bob a day and a lungful : of dust. CO wrote Jock Graham, a well- known miner-poet, in his prize-winning poem "Dark Roads," written to mark the 50th anniversary of the Miners' Federation being celebrated this month throughout Aus tralia. What other section of the Aus- . tralian working class has a richer history of struggle to tell of . . . shocking working and living conditions, mine disasters; greedy, callous owners, unemployment and much more. Miners were also among the first in Australia to raise the banner of socialism — as the answer to the social injustice of capitalism. Death and accidents were always close at hand as Jock's miner explains: Well, we just tops the last, and we're makin a crack About havin' ten shifts for the pay, When down comes the floater, right on my mate's back— - We buried poor Jimmy to-day . . . to-day, We buried poor Jimmy to-day. The Miners' Federation is holding a national convention in Syd ney simultaneously - with its birthday celebrations.. Problems of mechanisation, un employment, overseas pene tration into the industry, the inroads of oil into traditional coal markets and many other matters will be discussed. The convention was opened last week at New Theatre in Syd ney. Delegates and representatives of other unions gave high praise to a dramatic presentation by the Theatre, telling the story of mining in Australia. The script of "Come All You Valiant Miners" was written by Mona Brand in honour of the Federation's birthday. Two judges and a1- mine owner (pictured from the show) tell how miners have fared through arbitration.
