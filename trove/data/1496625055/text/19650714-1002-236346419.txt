 I Press statement I i Tribune issued a press statement last Friday night, fol- j I lowing an attack on Tribune by TV Channel 9 over pub- i | lication of a map of South Vietnam together with a legend 1 | . designating American-controlled areas as ''enemy-occupied | I areas". f | "THE statement was made j by Mr. A. Robertson, a i member of Tribune edi- | torial and a World War II I ex-serviceman (AIF and S RAAF) . He said: . j "This map was reproduced in | Tribune on July 7 from the j Peking Review No 26 but the S legend and wording at the side of I the map were included in error. | "Tribune published, its own | caption, under the map which I said that the map showed "in the i orroxr arooc tfhflf whioh has — \ I been i, liberated by the National j | Liberation Front; white areas j | show the territory under guerril- j I la occupation; and those tiny j 1 black areas depict the territory \ | held by U.S. and puppet troops." j j (The map specifically records j 1 the situation as it was in "early ! I 1965"— Australian troops were not j i in Vietnam until the second week j I in June. The term "puppet . I troops" refers to the troops of I i the non-elected Saigon regime, a j I puppet of the USA, and not to j I Australian troops which were \ | sent by decision of the Australian j S Government.) j j "The contents of the map— show- ! I ing the greater pan of the coun- | ! try occupied by the NLF and only j j a small fraction controlled by the i | USA— are unquestionably, correct, j "However the legend, with its j I reference to 'enemy-occupied j areas' does not represent Trib- | ! une's view but the view of the : I authors of the map.. ! I WRONG POIICY j ! "Tribune's repeatedly stated j | view is that the Federal Govern- j I ment's decision to send Austra- | i lian troops to Vietnam was : I wrong, since the American mill- I tary intervention is unjust and a | | violation of the 1954 Geneva j I Agreement. > j "We are concerned at the fate I j of young Australian soldiers | ! thrust into a hopeless and unjust ! j war in which already some have I j died. We are deeply sympathetic j ! to the families of all the soldiers . j, directly involved in this situation. I | "All Australia suffers because j I of this policy, which alienates our j j country from the majority of our 1 J neighbouring peoples of Asia. | "The best policy would be to ; | bring the Australian troops ) home,' as already demanded by I | many Australians, a number of j I British MPs and a number of , | Prime Ministers at- ' the British I 1 Commonwealth Conference." j I The above statement was dis- ) trihuted to the Sydney morning I and Sunday press, News Weekly, j the Bulletin, and certain TV and j radio stations. At time of going I to press, none had published it I in full. j Only the Sydney "Telegraph" 1 organisation dealt with the issue I in Sydney at the weekend, signi- j ficantly grouping it with Mr.. E. | G. Whitlam's statements in Singa- ! pore. A sinister reference to j "treason" was made by the Sun- | day Telegraph, which earlier this ! year stated that the only way I forward in Vietnam was "bomb, j bomb and bomb again." ' |
