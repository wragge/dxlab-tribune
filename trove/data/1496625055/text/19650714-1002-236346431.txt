 1 /4 once brought home the bacon If you walked into a store today, asked for lib . bacon and offered 1/4, they would probably send for a doctor (for you). BU.T. in 1939 you could buy; l lb of bacon for 1/4, which today would cost at least 7/6. This shows how prices have gone up, and it's happening all the time. If you stop people in the street, and asked what commodities had risen recently, they would give va gue and generalised answers, because they have been conditioned to pay the list price, including increases. People certainly know of current increases in meat, doctors' fees, etc. But they would not be certain of how much the increase was made. There is still a long way to go be fore there is general understanding that a price increase is really a wage cut. Worth millions Outside of a few price-controlled items in Queensland, NSW and South Australia., big business continually raises prices without any opposition from the Menzies government. It was only a half-penny increase in a middy of beer, but it was worth a million pounds a week to the NSW brewery interests. ' BHP raised the price of steel by 30/- a ton. This resulted in fatter profits. Bex headache powders went up . from l/- to 1/3 a packet. On October 9, 1939, the magazine "Woman", now incorporated in "Wo man's Day", published a prize-win ning Victorian weekly houshold bud get. The total cost of the budget then was £1/19/51. In 1964 a member of the Union of Australian Women priced the same budget in local stores in Bexley (NSW), and North Sydney. It added up to £9. This was an increase of approx. 350% for what is only a" very econ omic budget. The following table does not con tain all items on both budgets, but does serve as a comparison of prices.

The basic wage in 1939 was £4/1/0; it was £14/8/0 when the 1964 prices were checked. This is an in crease of 260%. Here you see the old familiar pat tern of wages chasing prices and al ways lagging behind. The Commonwealth Statistician publishes an official consumer price index. It is designed to register quarterly variation in prices. While the trade union movement does not accept the index as a true reflection of how prices are increas ing, still it shows the same up ward trend. It shows that between March 1949 and March 1965, prices in the index went up by 115 per cent. Since ' 1953 they increased by 30.9 per cent and since March 1964 by 4 per cent. Between March 1964 and March 1965 the index showed food prices increased by 6 per cent. Price rises In 1949 Sir Robert Menzies was elected to office with a promise to put value back in the pound. Xaking his own Government's statistician's figures, the amount of goods you could purchase for 9/35 in 1949, at today's prices would cost £1. Mr. Norman Docker, Waterside Worker's Federation industrial offic er commenting on price rises said: "In 1950 the first major basic wage decision gave the workers a basic wage of £8/2/0. "Calculated on the price rises shown by the Commonwealth Statistician's index, the basic wage today would have to be £16/1/0. 13/- more than at present in order to buy what the 1950 basic wage of £8/2/0 could buy. "In the same way, a fitter whose margin in 1947 was £2/12/0 would need a margin of £6/19/0 to purchase today what his 1947 margin could buy. "So despite all the great increases In production and profits, a fitter can buy only £2 less worth of goods than he could with his 1947 wage." "In the same way, a process work er's wage buys £2/2/0 less than his 1950 wage could buy." The answer: A struggle for a £22 family basic wage and the reintro- duction of price control.
