 T ribune Fund too modest ? By JUNE MILLS WITH the donations to hand this week, Tribune Fund needs £1,464/5/8 to reach the target of £4000 for 1965 Do you think those responsible for setting the target were too modest? If so, will you write and tell us — and send a donation, of course. Remember in the June 16 Tribune I wrote about our friend P. O'Dea and the recollection Phil Johnson had about his work in the early days of the trade union movement? Now P. O'Dea has sent another 10/- donation and some corrections about Phil's story. He says: "It was in 19J.0 that the Women's Section of the AWU was founded, thanks to the efforts of AWU mem bers in Charleville who resented the fact that women were worked from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. with no day off . . . Believe me as one who played a small part in the fight it was worth while;" Thanks for the donation, old timer —and I envy your memory! A donation of 4/6 comes to Tri- bune from R.McK. prompted by the honesty of a bus conductor who handed in a purse he'd lost, money intact. As a result R.McK. has purchased two tickets in the special lottery and hopes they win "and a further donation can be made to Tribune by a wharfie and a bus conductor.
