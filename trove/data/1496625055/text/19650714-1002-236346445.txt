 [?] VyhlLE filling in your taxation return you might be "pleased" to know that as a worker, your human values have a lower rating than your employers machine. The additional wear and tear on workers who are forced to work- over time (in many cases excessive) to try - and make ends meet receives no con cessional treatment by the Taxation Department. On the other hand, if a machine's normal working day is eight hours per day and it is worked in excess of this, then -the boss can claim greater depreciation. rpwO views expressed during last. week's NSW Labor Council deb ate on the ACTU's decision not to call strike action as a protest against the Arbitration Commission's wage dr -.ision : — Jack Sponberg (Sydney Boilermak er): "Fifteen years ago Chifley in this f- hall called on unions to resist the Menzies Government 'which hated the guts of the working class and which would do everything to. shackle the trade unions — to make them tame cat'. "Failure to take action will mean getting milk sops in future from reac tionary judges," he said. Joe Riordan (Clerks Union — ACTU executive member): "Some people are . trying to undermine the ACTU. "It was sheer nonsense to talk about a £22 basic wage claim! "Does Sponberg want wild cat un ions?" "WOULD you let your daughter read Lady Chatterley's Lov er?", an English Peer was asked. Certainly, but I wouldn't lend it to my gamekeeper!" rpHE women's group of the Libera' Party now reckon the school kids are being subverted with "Commun is1 propaganda." We strongly believe they have evid ence of children being told that social ist countries exist in the world and that trade unions a.re not wicked. The Liberal women also want to sterihse "sub-normal criminals". SO DID HITLER!
