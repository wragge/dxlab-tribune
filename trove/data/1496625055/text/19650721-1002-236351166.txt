 [?] j Congratulations I I to Ron Clarke! | By THE CHALLENGER ( 1 i ! "pRIBUNE joins with J the many thousands j of people everywhere ! in congratulating Ron | Clarke on his most j successful athletics jtour. I Clarke's achievements j have brought forth such j praise as "the greatest | long distance runner of all J time" that "his tour will | be long remembered in j. the annals of athletics as i the summit of long dis- | tance running par excel- ! lence", and „so forth. 1 He smashed 12 world records I in only 16. races. I His ability to produce such | fantastic results is a credit due S mainly to his own drive and £ I dedication to the sport of athle-. | itics. | That his records will be better- S I ed in this day and age is only I | a matter of time, for the train- i | ing and competitive conditions = throughout the world are gener- I ally improving. j j But, can the average- Austra- j I lian sportsman answer favour- | I ably for the Australian govern- j | ment if he were asked, "Does s j the government do all it can to ! I help the Australian sportsman | I. develop? . | And while on the subject, why I I wasn't there some form of offi- 9 | cial government recognition for j I his fine performances overseas? g A public reception or such. I j would have paid him the tribute I I he so richly deserves. 1 | What a wonderful month this ! | has been for Australia in the I I world of sport | At Wimbledon we had winners S 1 Roy Emerson, Margaret Smith, I S John Newcombe and Tony j | Roach; Peter Thompson won the j | British Open, and Ron Clarke's I e record-shattering tour. j j Give 'em a go! I IN Blacktown sport is really I ) popular with the youngsters, j j Tennis, swimming, football, judo ! ! and cricket reports were recently ) I given prominence in the "Black- | S town Advocate". g I One of the best prospects is a I I young swimmer Lance Ogston of ! J Seven Hills. Though only nine, he I | has the potential of a future j S Olympic representative. j j Lance is the under 10-year-old I I State Primary School backstroke j S champion , and came second in | | the State Amateur Backstroke ! I Championship. j I He is also the Blacktown I Amateur Swimming Club's under ! | 10 freestyle, backstroke and but- I | terfly champion. j 1 Mr. Adam Ogston, Lance's j | father, this week told Tribune, g 2 that although there was a very I | large number of keen sports I | youngsters in the Blacktown 1 !8 area, these was a very drastic I shortage of facilities and coaches. ! | Mr. Ogston said that in soccer S there was a large number of j I youngsters who wanted to play | I but couldn't, because they were 1 i unable to get into a team. I $ The local shires have not prov- I J ided enough facilities. | Any move in that direction has I I proved to be just talk, said Mr; j ' Ogston. | wwwgaMaMmMiDaMwMnwanflC For the Blacktown Amateur I Swimming club with over 400 ! _ members, there is only one pool I in which to train. j During the summer months it is far too crowded for effective ! training, said Mr. Ogston. Besides | : the; club coach, there were only j six others, and these were volun- I teers. j About- 60 club members travel i each Friday night to the heated ! pool at Cabramatta so as to I continue this winter training. j Young Lance Ogston, to carry ! on a year-round training sched- I ule, does calesthenics at home 1 every .morning. Four times a j week he goes to the professional ! coach Don Talbot, twice for | actual swimming training and || twice for calisthenics. j The road to the top of the jj " sporting world is indeed a tough ft one, but could be a whole lot I easier if the'' government would 1 provide immediate suitable facil- J ities. if
