 " It's not much , but it all goes to help" By JUNE MILLS This week we received a donation from a subscriber in Victoria, the widow of a World War I TP! soldier. She sent £1, saying, "It's not much, but will help with the good work that is being done by Tribune". DEADERS will be pleased to hear that Tribune stalwart selfer Butch Wharton is recov ering from his illness. In his last letter he said: "I think it's very important to be regularly on the street stand each week with Tribune". Now there Is some sad news. We have been advised of the death of pat O'Dea, that wonderful friend of Tribune about whom I wrote in this column last week, when acknowledg ing his donation. He passed away peacefully in his sleep and one of his last acts must have been to send that 10/- to the Fund. This week's donations leave fl,457 to reach our 1965 target: J. R. £1, Paul-fares 1/6, S.
