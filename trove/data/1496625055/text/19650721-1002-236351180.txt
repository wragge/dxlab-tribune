 (3000000 "Poverty in Australia is masked by the feeling of affluence" As a lifelong church member I would like to extend a hearty wel come to the economic pro- gram of the Communist p-rty of Australia. I fee! that this program shows the best way of waging the "war on poverty." which is obviously almost as necessary here as in the USA. In this connection I notice that the Central Methodist Mission paper Impact supports Labor Leader Cal- well's recent call for a survey on poverty in Australia. The mission's assistant superin tendent, Rev. W. D. Adams, said .in the paper that, in this "affluent" society, his Mission has to spend half a million pounds every year "meeting a wide range of commum ity needs". Mr. Adams says "There is no room for complacency because, our general standard of living in comparatively hih - - . ' , "Poverty in Australia, is masked by the feeling of affluence but in such a society the poverty of the poor becomes more acute. "This is especially true of people on small fixed incomes. "Gaps in the social service pro gram mean that some people some times experience genuine hardship". Mr. Adams lists as among those known by the Mission's Life Line Centre to need special help: Desert ed wives with young children; wom en widowed in middle age with no special qualifications; unmarried mothers; men between 55 and 65 who are suddenly sacked; the men tally and physically handicapped; people lately released from jail, This is the testimony of someone who knows— who spends a large part of his time actually relieving the poverty-stricken. One must honor such people— yet it is plain that the solution they of fer, charitable relief, is unsatisfac tory as a final solution. Indeed it is none. That is why many of us, looking for a constructive, way out, cannot but welcome such proposals as those of the Communist Partv. Methodist, Sydsaey (NSW).
