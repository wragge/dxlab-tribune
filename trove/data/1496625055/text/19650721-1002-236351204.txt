 KSP: Selected short stories fit yDMIRERS of Katharine Susannah Prichard, legion in Australia and many overseas countries, will warmly wel- come "ON STRENUOUS WINGS"-— a half-century of her selected writings. Joan Williams' introduction gives a brief outline of Katharine's life -and devotion to her work, quoting Pro fessor Walter Murdoch: "In the Parliament of world litera ture, she is the Memoer for Austra lia: and we are proud of our repre sentative . . . There are selections from seven of her novels — "The Pioneers", "Black Opal", "Working Bullocks", "Wild Oats of Han", "Coonardoo", "Haxby's Circus", "Moon of De sire". Three poems, which may be new even to avid readers of Katharine's books: "The Eartn Lover", "Lips of My Love", "Prayer". The section Vignettes includes brief extracts covering almost half a century of K.S.P.'s articles and ad dresses on contemporary issues. These show the devotion of the author to- peace and socialism, to literature, to children. Best of all perhaps are six short stories, some about Aborigines writ ten with all the warmth and feeling the author has for these Austra lians. Recently I visited Katharine Sus- - anah Pritchard in Greenmount, out side Perth. Recovering from a severe ill ness, she still maintains her con tact with well-known writers in many countries and with indomi table courage is writing another book. "ON STRENUOUS WINGS" will give those who knowand love her writings an opportunity of renew ing acquaintance with the charac ters in many novels, and those who have not yet read them a desire to do so. Price 7/6 the book is available at New World Booksellers, 425 Pitt Street, Sydney and all progressive bookshops. — J.M.
