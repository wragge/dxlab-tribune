 [?] il Life is not all beer and skittles on the waterfront, but what makes it just so much Q harder for wharfies are the "experts'7 who, ever since the days of the windjammers, j have been giving the public long and windy advice on a subject they usually know j I little or nothing about. ! Big daily newspapers like the Sydney Morning Herald, who charge for space at about j I j the same rate as shipowners, think nothing of giving pages over to such experts. J But they solve nothing on the waterfront. j I j The Herald, recently ran a series of such articles, the first of which was titled ' j "The making of a wharfie". j I They appeared under the name of a certain Fred Wells,, who didn't succeed in | j | making a wharfie out of himself. He joined the Federation in 1948 and left after a j ! I few months. j A few months in 1948 is quite sufficient to make a 1965 "expert" for the Herald, j particularly if given Wells' talents for attacking those who once considered and s &lt; treated him as a friend.
