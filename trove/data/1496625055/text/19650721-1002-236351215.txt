 Garden Island workers angry at delays CYDNEY: A mass meeting of about 2000 workers at Garden Island Dockyard in S-'dney decided (ao stop work for the afternoon last Monday in protest against long delays in granting wage and annual leave claims. The meeting was called to hear re ports from a federal unions confer ence which discussed these claims last week in Melbourne. Many of the 51 items included in the claims qf workers in Common wealth establishments were first rais ed in 1961. Last week's meeting of 34 federal unions in Melbourne (by ' 28 to six) asked the Australian Council of Trade Unions to call a stoppage of all Com monwealth departments to hear re ports on these claims and to consider further action. The ACTU was also asked to seek a joint campaign with the Australian Council of Salaried and Professional Associations and the High Council of Commonwealth Public Service Organ isations to press the demand for an extra week's annual leave. The federal unions proposed that this campaign include lunch hour meetings to be held prior to a con ference with the Prime Minister and that public meetings be held in all the main centres throughout the Com monwealth. The unions' negotiating committee is also asked to take up "as a matter of urgency" the wage and leave claims with the Public Service Board.
