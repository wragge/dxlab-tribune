 | . With Tribune's Industrial ' Roundsman AT last Saturday's annual meeting of the NSW Branch f of t e. Australian Workers' i Urron a rank and filer moved j that tue- ,AWU give, physical and financial supoort to the , A'i-tr?lin Labpr Party during ; e'tirns. Ve heard down the grape vine that s :'ory Charlie Oliver . strongly op- po:c.;l this move and with the support of o'her officials knocked it over. This is a strange stand for the N '.W. president of the A.L.P. to take e cn if he is waiting for "new leaders to come forward who are worthy of support " ? Eric Baume (The Man On His '> Side) always ready and brave to in- sult, condemn and harangue people on his television session or in the seclu sion of a radio station, is not pre pared to debate with a Communist! The Sydney University Union had earlier asked Alec Robertson, from Tribune, to join a team to debate Baume and Sir William Yeo (R.S.L.), "That this House Should Never For get". What are you afraid of, Mr. Baume? you must know that Alec was a digger who fought for his country. Isn't he worthy of your association? Or might he be too tough for you to handle, Mr. Baume? . . . this we believe! ? The A.C.T.U. this week applied to have the Arbitration Commission re consider its paltry wage offer. J. Robinson for. the employers said the unions' application should be dis missed as it is an insult to the Com mission. If there are to be prizes given for insults we know who would cop the ; lot! '? A former company director told a bankruptcy court this week in Syd ney he spent £250 a week on personal living expenses. Since May this year he had been "absolutely flat". "Such a miserable time, it's hardly worth living," he said. He only gets £40 a week now as a "salesman." The A.C.T.U. should get him to plead .« the case lor a higher basic wage!
