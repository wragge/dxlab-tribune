 An 1 1 -year-old writes IpHE Junior Eureka League (JEL) is a working class or ganisation for girls and boys be tween the ages of 10-16 years. This organisation was formed by the Eureka Youth League who appoints Senior Leaders. Senior Leaders are not Only mem bers of the Eureka Youth League but are also adults with many skills. Senior Leaders guide and assist members and strive to develop a sense of responsibility towards each other. Our projects and games not only provide the members with a really good time but also helps them to understand the struggle of the work ing class and the useful people of our land. We take the name "Eureka" from the gold miners who fought at the -ureka Stockade. Each member is given a blue orf (the colour of our flag). Awards are given through a six uonths period for: Attendance, friendship, merit, project and "Cobber". At the end of the six month period stars are given to members who have won awards at a pioneer and graduation ceremony. Although Senior Leaders care and look after us we learn to lead ourselves. We elect our own leaders called pioneers. At every meeting we have a JEL on duty. This JEL has the responsibility of marking down points achieved by members. Each branch elects an executive which consists of a chairman, sec retary, treasurer .and sports girl or boy. These members meet before the meeting and discuss with the Senior Leader what activities the JEL's are going to do. Every JEL participates in the acti vities such as campaign, concerts, bushwalks, music, acting, dancing, sports, projects and crafts. The JEL is designed to give all its members a really good time. No one person is entertained, every one has a chance at everything. I think the JEL is a good organisa tion and I would like to see more members, especially in the New castle branch.
