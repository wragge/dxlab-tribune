 Save -the Children " HE letter in last week's Tribui.. from a "Methodist", praising the Communist Party's economic program was most intelligent. I was reminded of it after I re- ceived a circular from the Sydney Rescue Work Society thanking me for a donation and saying: "The modern kitchen and ser- very will greatly assist us in "the serving of free meals to hungry mert and women, yes, and children too. "At the present time we serve hundreds of meals each week." The letter says that there is an urgent need for expanding the society's work because "the facili ties in our various homes and re lief centres are already overtaxed." . So our affluent depression-proof society, where everything is con trolled by kindly and knowledgeable economic advisers to the Govern ment, is one where children go hungry and relief of the destitute is a work urgently needing expan sion! I honor the Rescue Work society for what it is doing, as your other correspondent honors the Central Methodist mission. But like our friend I think that something more than charity is needed and hence I, too, welcome such proposals as those in the Communist Partv's Droerram. "Save Our Children", Sydney (N.S.W.).
