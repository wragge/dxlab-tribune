 [?] With Tribune's Industrial Roundsman XA/EALTHY newspaper owners employ executives to do their dirty work, particularly when they are attacking the workers. But it's obvious these people don't like the "indignity" of meeting their victims, particularly if they are wharfies. Last Friday about 200 Sydney wharfies arrived at the Daily Tele graph's building just as the editor (McNicol) was leaving. Throwing dignity to the winds, he took off running, with the wharfies hot on his tail! ? One of the wharfie hostages spoke at a strike meeting last week of Aus tralian Paper Mill's workers. : Although these workers were loosing a day's pay, they decided to take round the hat for the wharfies, and collected Â£20. As one paper worker said: "There is no group of workers in Australia that hasn't got help from the wharfies when in struggle. "Now it's our turn to help." ? Ex-Earl, now just plain Sir Alec, Home has resigned as leader of the British Tories, and according to wide press opinion has become "the greatest failure in modern politics." The kids call crackers that don't go off "damp squibs"! Only three weeks ago Sir Robert Menzies said of Sir Alec: "I think he is the greatest man in the kingdom." ? And did you know that Dame Pattie Menzies is still so excited when she dines at the Queen's table she canont remember what she ate? Just think, they could have dished her up mashed spuds and mince! "It's always exciting to eat off a gold plate, isn't it?" guests at the WIZO's (Women International Zionist Organisation) gala luncheon were asked by Dame Pattie. A mate of mine reckons his wife's a "WIZO" the way she makes his lousy .wages spin out. Anyway, it's nice to know that Dame Pattie feels she has "been having a little bit of glamour lately" and that "a little bit of glamour every now and again is good for a woman."
