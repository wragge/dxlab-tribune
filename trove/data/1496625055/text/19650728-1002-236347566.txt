 [?] | Clear It Up! I By "THE CHALLENGER" j I I j The attitude of the Australian Swimming I .Union last week to its ban on the four Olympic j j swimmers — Dawn Fraser (10 years), Linda McGill j ! (four years) Marlene Dayman and Nan Duncan j ! (three years) — again reveals the lack of demo- j ! cracy at the top level of the Australian Swimming j J Union. ! | |N the first place, the | ASU has not made pub- I lie the reasons for its j action of banning the girls | last February; j It must have some very strong | reasons for imposing such heavy . | penalties, but despite strong I public protest, the ASU sees fit ! to consider itself the sole judge' I of the seriousness of the matter. | At the ASU half-yearly con- | ference last Saturday, a West | Australian move to lift the ban | was reported to have been deferred indefinitely. ! The ASU president, Mr. D. A. | Dowling, said: "Western .Aus- Stralia is at liberty to bring the matter up at the next confer- | ence." I The next conference is Feb- ! ruary, 1966. I Twelve months out of the | swimming life of top-line swim- !mers is a very serious if not fatal setback to their careers J and it would be in the best | interests of swimming generally ! if the whole matter of the bans were at once cleared up. j Should boxing I be banned? JN the western world, boxing I has over the years been sub- I jected to some fairly severe and | sound criticisms. | Leading citizens have from I time to time openly condemned I it and called for its abolition or I strict, control. j One person, Dr. Edith Summer- j skill, a former English MP and j - now a member of the House of I Lords has written a book— "The j Ignoble Art"— outlining the phy- J sical damage caused by boxing I to the brain. j It puts forward a very strong I argument for the abolition of j boxing. j Professional boxing can imbue ! a spirit of greed and corruption | that can undoubtedly effect the J health of the boxer. ! Many a story has been told of j the tragic end of the so called | "crowd pleasers" and of the j scandalous "fixed fights". | These things have led people to | outright condemnation of boxing, j over-looking the conditions under j which boxing is run. | A look at several of the lead- j ing boxers in the Soviet Union ! tends to support the theory that | it is primarily the way and the j condition under which boxing is j run in western countries that is I the basic cause of its low rat- j ing. | Take for example Valery Pop- | enchenko and Gennady' Shatkov j two of the Soviet Union's and j the world's leading amateur box- J ers. j Anyone with western ideas j about boxing looking through ! the list of Olympic gold-medalists j at the Melbourne and Tokyo j games would " not have worried = about looking to the boxers for I any academic qualifications. | Yet it is a fact that Shatkov, j Pro-Rector of Leningrad Univer- | = sity, is a Master of Law. ) j His boxing record shows that j !" he won a -gold medal at the Mel- | bourne Olympics, the European ) | championship and three times j I the national championship of the j I Soviet Union. j | Valery Popenchenko, gold j I medal winner at the Tokyo = i Olympics and winner of the In | I ternational Amateur Boxing As- j J sociation's Barker Prize for the j | best technique and tactics has | i lost only ten of the 218 bouts o! j I his boxing career. j | Last November when asked oy = I "Moscow News" about his future j I' plans, Popenchenko said that he j had recently started on a post- j graduate course and aimed to j | present his thesis for a Master ot j 8 Science degree later on. j | A documentary film "The j I Grandmaster of the Ring" has . | been produced about Popenchen- | a ko and" the title for it no doubt j I stems from his liking for chess, j 8 When asked what he did while = I waiting for bis bout in Tokyo, j I Popechenko said that he read j j Alexander Kotov's book "Alyok- = | hin's Heritage in Chess" and I | solved chess problems. j 1 The Belgian dramatist Maeter j = link disagreed with the critics or j 0 boxing and considered it the I 2 supreme intellectual exercise ot j | the muscles and a developer ol j f keen-ness of eye and courage = 1 Indeed, the above two Soviet 1 Union sportsmen are fine exam- | 2 pies of what boxing— if we are j 1 to continue to have it-r-can Pr- , j duce; provided it is run under | j the proper conditions. j
