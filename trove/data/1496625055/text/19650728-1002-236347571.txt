 Askin Govt. reveals I bios to landlords Bo) mf SYDNEY: The Askin Liberal Government will put into the hands ! of New South Wales landlords power to enquire into the financial .affairs of all tenants . RY this single action, the NSW Government has re vealed litself clearly as a gov ernment of the profit-making classes. If a landlord alleges' that all living in a house have a combined income of £3000, the tenant must satisfy the Housing Minister it is not so, or have his premises removed from rent control. A tenant, in fact, may not have to be very wealthy to come into the net of the landlord— for example, if the income of a husband, working wife, children and relatives from the country working in the city were combined. Means test The whole approach is wrong in principle, for it applies a means tst to a tenant iri the interests of the landlords. As noted in a letter to the "Herald" (July 24): "It would be an extra ordinary privilege to allow landlords to enquire into the financial means of their tenants without themselves being subjected to similar scrutiny." May come down Mr. W. Weight, president of the Real Estate Institute of NSW, said (Sydney Morning Herald, July 24): "The income level of £3000 is too high, but could be lowered if it proved successful in bringing - about more reasonable rental agreements."
