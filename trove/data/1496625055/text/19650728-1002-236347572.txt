 Ask Tribune readers for a donation ! By JUNE MILLS Two pensioner friends of Tribune have again made contributions to the Fund this v/ek. Knowing the hard struggle pen sioners have to manage on their meagre hand-out from the Federal Government we really greatly ap- reciate these donations. We are also very grateful to D.R. A.Y. for his continued splendid sup port for the fund. I want to ask Tribune sellers whose names do not appear in this column a question— Do you ask everyone who buys a paper to make a donation to the Fund? I know that the answer is in the negative, for if everyone who sold a Tribune collected even 6d a week, we'd be even nearer to overfulfil ment of the £4,000 target. So to those who do not ask for a , donation, this is a special request; &lt; start from this week.
