 Ernst Busch 9s chronicle of the 20th Century in songs , ballads, cantatas ERNST BUSCH, was was 65 this year, was until recently a member ©f the Berlin Ensemble theatre company. Roles like the army cook in Bertolt Breclil's "Mother Cour- age", or the title role in Brccht's' "Galileo" made him world famous as an actor. But as early as the I920's he was singing political songs and folk songs which gave him the reputa tion of a singer of and for the people. Like many others he had to leave Germany when the fascists were put into power in 1933. In 1936, he served in the Interna tional Brigades in Spain fighting to preserve the will of the Spanish people. He started then to record his almost inexhaustible repertoire of songs. This was interrupted and only com pleted when the German Academy of Arts began to record Busch's songs for the archives. Five titles have been produced so far: the historic recording of 193? with the Spanish Civil War songs; "New German Folk Songs" by Johannes R. Becher with music by Hans Eisler; a Louis Furnberg recoru; a Mayakovsky-Eisler record and "Satirical Songs" by Frank Wedckind. Just recently, work was completed on the first series of a survey of the "Golden Twenties". After this will come Bert Brrcht, Kurt Tucholsky, Erich Mubsam, Klabund, and others. In all, Ernst Busch will interpret more than 200 songs on Aurora Records. When the collection is completed, it will be a "Chronicle of the First Half of the 20th Century in Songs, Ballads, and Cantatas". II HIHTWII I III ! 'HHIHIH IWWIHHHWM1IIIMHU IIMWMIIHIMMWn—
