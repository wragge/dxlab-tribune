Or: "I'd like to come but I might get a night shift H tomorrow. . They toil in ships' holds and on obsolete wharves. Working in shifts around the clock when required, they load the wool, wheat,, flolir, timber, meat and other products for overseas. They load and unload the ships that ply around Australia's coast, squelching on festering hides, their eyes turned red from sulphur and other dangerous cargoes. It takes them days to ..scrub lamp black out of. their skins. , Some of them are killed, as a slio sends them crashing down a ship's hold. Others are crushed to death, many are seriously hurt. Hardly a day passes without attacks on them by daily press and other mouthpieces of the shipowners.

Yet the wharfies last year handled record overseas trading that repre sented 35 per cent of Australia's gross national income.
