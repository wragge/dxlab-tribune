 FACTS BEHIND BHP PROFIT CJYDNEY : Boost in dividend rate announced by the stee monopoly, Broken Hill Pty., last week, will give the Darling family an extra t4UU a week from their shareholdings. Others among the 60 richest families in Australia will take correspondingly juicy slices. BHP's disclosed group profit this year reached a new high level of £19.6 million. This is an increase of £1.9 million on last year's disclosed net profit of P17 1 nnillinn on/1 ie fS 9. million mrvro than was made in 1962-63. Earning rate on capital increased from 15.6 per cent, to 17.3 per cent, and the dividend rate from 7.1 per cent, to 8.5 per cent. Real Profit BHP's real profit and real increase in profit are much higher than the figure disclosed. Additional hidden profits are con tained in the balance sheet items, "depreciation" and "taxation provi sion." The former was raised from £28.7, ..million to £33.4 million and the latter from £12.3 million to £15.3 million — a total of £7.7 million for the two items. It has been the long-standing cus tom of BHP to finance a large part of plant expansion from retained profit. They have jacked up steel prices to make this possible. This year's increased profit re sulted from increased exploitation of steelworkers, miners and seamen employed by BIIP, and from con sumers of the company's products. This is revealed by the fact that steel ingot production during the ; past year increased by 7.7 per cent., whereas disclosed profit increased by 11.4 per cent. The figures reveal the industry's capacity to pay the £22 a week which many unions are claiming at a mini mum family living wage. The whole picture shows how nationalisation" of steel could be used to channel big-scale wealth to public needs.— E.W.G.
