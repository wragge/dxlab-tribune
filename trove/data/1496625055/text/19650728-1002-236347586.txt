 0000000 The Saigon mockery of 'democracy' and . 'freedom' tHE corruptness of the Saigon (South Viet nam) regime, as pin pointed by a recent issue of the American "Time" magazine (July 9) makes mockery of Canberra claims that "democracy" and "freedom" are being- defended there. That is, unless it is freedom for grand larceny! "Time" says: "Though Premier Nguyen Cao Ky promises to execute profiteers, he has yet to make good his threatâ€” and bullets alone can hardly reverse Saigon's rising tide of corruption. "A huge, incalculable bite from Washington's $1 billion foreign aid program is taken each year by gov ernment and military officials. "U.S. refrigerators and air condi tioners meant for hospitals end up in general's homes; troop command ers collect the "phantom pay" of soldiers whose deaths in combat go unreported in Saigon. "For $675 a well-to-do youth can buy an Interior Ministry "diploma" that certifies him as a government spy, thus exempting him from army service. "A trick currently in favor with provincial chiefs is to blow -up a provincial bridge, blame the Viet- cong and win a fat construction contract from Saigon." C.V, Sydney (N.S.W.).
