Hungary, 1956 Among the feature films wortl : mention was France's "Skic bove", a finely acted anti-wa !m. "Twenty Hours" is the first at unapt to put on film an objective cccount of the 1956 Hungarian lprising and because of this it attracted the widest attention and interest. This Hungarian film dealt very frankly with many basic problems of socialism. The German Democratic Republic, having no inhibitions in branding German militarism, provided the Festival with "The Adventures of Werner Holt" which would be a truly great anti-militarist film, but for defects in continuity. 1 Progressive West German film makers deserve special credit- for their "Uncle Tom's Cabin". Although operating in a difficult .political atmosphere they still j managed to make Uncle Tom Iook u more like the civil rights leader g in today's Deep South, than hM Harriet Beecher Stowe's more re- \ signed character.
