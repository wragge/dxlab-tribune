 Can't distract people from US aggression From "Moscow News" An attempt is being made to use a campaign around the "Jewish problem" in the Soviet Union to distract public attention from United States acti vity in Vietnam and Dominica and from racial discrimination in the USA, says a prominent Soviet Jewish poet. VA/RITING ih Moscow News (26/6/65) the poet Aron Verge I is says: â€” "Ignorance of the public in other countries about the present life of Soviet Jewry provides fertile soil foi political speculators and professional liars on whom it has dawned that the "question" of Soviet Jewry might be quite a good thing for their pockets and their careers. "According to the data for Decem ber 1, 1962, people of Jewish nationality comprised 5 per cent of the total number of Soviet people with higher or secondary special education. Let us recall that Jews in the U.S.S.R. comprise 1.1 per cent of the entire population. If we compare the share of people with higher or special secondary education res pectively with the total number of Russians, Ukrainians and Jews the following picture will emerge: this group acccounts for 6 per cent oi jjfissians, 5 per cent of Ukrainians and 20 per cent of Jews! "Jews account for 14.7 per cent of the overall number of physicians in the U.S S.R., for 10.4 per cent of all lawyers, 8.6 per cent of jour nalists and 7.7 per cent of actors and musicians.
