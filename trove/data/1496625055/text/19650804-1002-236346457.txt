 Wage increase Would you please advise mc whether the li per cent increase in margins to all Metal Trades workers (Federal award) include over-award payments which are incorporated into our wage structure as an hourly rate and not a bonus. If this is so then ' idustry is taking money from the employees, as employers will not take into consideration over-award pay ments. W. G. Bennett, Fairymeadow (N.S.W.). . EDITOR'S NOTE: The majority judgment of the Jommission increased margins of workers covered by the Federal Metal Trades Award by amounts equal to U per cent of the total sum of the six capital cities basic wage plus each current margin. It does not take into consideration ,ny over-award payments. The increased margin for a fitter ising the above formula is 6/-. This is 1£ per cent of £20/14/- (the um of £15/8/- basic wage, plus ;5/6/- his margin). A second class welder under the Metal Trades Award would receive 5/. This is li per cent of £17/18/- (the sum of £15/8/- basic wage, plus his margin of £2/10/).. The decision will also eliminate apprentices and junior workers from even, a small increase. This is so because apprentices and junior workers generally have their wages based on a percent age of the basic wage and do not get a margin as such. The decision has also been inter preted to discriminate against some women workers who at the 'moment are receiving equal margins with men but not the same basic wage.
