 Safety on the road ¥ HAVE been a taxi driver in Sydney for the last 42 years and have not yet had an accident. At the same time I only attribute this to taking a lot of care on the road, especially checking the run ning order of the vehicle, balding tyres, etc. I see many serious accidents on the road. There are three places that have no lights hut ought to have them as soon as possible. They are the intersections of Bourke Street, and Botany Road, Alison Road and Anzac Parade and Cleveland Street and Anzac Parade. There is a serious accident on these corners at least once a fort night. Why -are there no lights there? There are, I think, eight sets of lights along some stretches of the inner city. Why this neglect of dangerous intersections? By the way, though teenagers have the most accidents they are not the least courteous. They are not taught the dangers r\f fV»n vnorle B.
