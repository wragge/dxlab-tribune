 Aboriginals hunting for jobs: " Might as well go back to the bush " Aboriginal people living in the Bellwood Mission Station at Nambucca Heads, NSW are finding it al most impossible to obtain employment in the dis trict. There is no industry or farming activities of any kind at the mission. They pay 1 2/6 a week for houses that are little more than huts. There are no bath rooms attached, and a cam paign by the local Chamber of Progress was needed to have electricity connected to them. Mr. . Benjamin Buchanan, an Aboriginal at the Mission said bit terly, "there's nothing here, a man might as well go hack to the bush." Coffs Harbor Mrs. Marshall, is pictured prepar ing her ironing in the kitchen. She had tooiled it on an open fire in the back yard. Further north, at Coff's Harbor, conditions are far worse at the Aboriginal Welfare Board settlement. About 100 people live here and the housing is a disgrace. Some of the white people in Ci/'s Harbor have adopted Aboriginal children. The parents have them adopted because in most cases they can't afford to keep them. Jobs for Aboriginals, particularly women, always scarce, are now almost non-existant after the long drought followed by the recent floods.
