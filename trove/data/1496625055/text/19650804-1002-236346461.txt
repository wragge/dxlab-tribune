 The US apologises rPHE U.S.A. has apologised to France for sending a spy-plane over a French atom-bomb factory and promised it won't happen again. Not so long ago — in 1960 — Soviet premier Khrushchov demand; ed just such an apology , and assur ance after Powers' U2 flight. Eisen hower refused. When Khrushchov then withdrew from the Paris summit conference the world's anti-Soviet press storm ed at him for asking the impos sible and unthinkable. Now it seems it wasn't so im possible after all — and it becomes plainer than ever who was respon sible for destroying the summit hopes and dragging the world kick into the cold war.
