 Wages of Aborigines JfT is a significant contrast to tli efforts of the trade unioi movement to improve the wage? and working conditions of tin Aborigines that the wealthy meal producing interests of Australiar and America have formed them selves into an alliance to oppose the industrial claims which woul advance the interest of the Abor: gines. It is evident that these mon polies — Cattle Producers' Associ; tion, Northern Territory Pastor? Lessees Association and the Catth men's Association — and their rey resentatives are bent on keeping th Aborigines subjugated and on very low standard. Mr. Kerr, Q.C. the legal advocat for the Cattlemen's Association rt cently made some very discrimin; tory and unfair remarks about th Aborigines in the Court. Many of the arguments he pv forward seem to be for the gener? purpose of frustrating the genert advance of the Aborigines, to pn vent any attempt to place them o an equal level with white people. Mr. Kerr proposed that the Aboj gines should have a category syste: of fixing wages, based on perforr ance of work and ability. Such a system would he use». against the welfare of the Abori gines. It is the duty of the whole labor movement and others concerned with the jvell-being oF Aborigines to assist in seeing that they have equal rights and equal oportunities with other Australians.
