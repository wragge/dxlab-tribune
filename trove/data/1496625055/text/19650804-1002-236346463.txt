 .eal genius pVERY critique I have read &lt;> the performance in Australii by Soviet pianist Pavel Serebry ikov has been full of praise. I have heard his performance? >f a Mozart sonata and of Tchai Itovsky's piano concerto on radio and would find it hard not to cal him a genius. Hlis name was not widely know ere until now. Now that it is known and rer )ected by audiences whose enthu siasm was unrestrained, I hope wc shall have another visit. T.ftvPP. Mosman (N.S.W.).
