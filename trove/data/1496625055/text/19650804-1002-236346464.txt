 Yanks can't win nrilAT the United States' wicked colonialist war in Vietnam is hopeless (as well as unjust), -as Tribune has often maintained, is proved beyond doubt by a negro clergyman, the Rev. James Lawson, who has recently spent three weeks in Vietnam in a fact-finding mis sion. In an interview reported in the "Australian" (July 17), the Rev. Lawson said: ' "The most optimistic estimate I heard was that if America was pre pared to pour everything into the war she- might be able in 10 years to drive the Vietcong to the 17th parallel (the border with North Vietnam). "Even this would resolve notb :ng â€” it would create another stair nate." Mr. Lawson said America's polic; n the war was "a tragically mis aken one based on unreality." Newsmen , and' military men . had old the mission that, even if \merica poured in thousands more roops, i.t could not hope to win he war. Australians should take note o lis before it is too late, as th mks can't win in Vietnam! K. Ross, Sydney (N.S.W.).
