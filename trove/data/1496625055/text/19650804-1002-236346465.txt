 0000000 The inclusion of child endowment in assessing some social services I WOULD like to draw at- tention to the un justness of the Federal Government's pol- icv of taking into account child endowment when asses sing the allowance paid to dependant wives and children of social service pensioners. It is interesting to note that child endowment, as the title states, was introduced for a specific purpose; it is paid to any person who has the custody, care and control of one or more children under the age of 16 years who reside permanently in Australia; it is paid completely free of a means test and therefore ' should not be included when the Government is assessing pensioners' dependant allowances. Certainly it is difficult to imagine the Federal Government and its advisers taking into account endow ment when assessing salaries and wages paid to employees of the Commonwealth nor is it conceivable on the part of employers in the private sector of the community. Of paramount importance to pen sioners and dependants, however, is the fact that child endowment is certainly taken into account when ever the cost of living of the com munity as a whole has been assessed or whenever it is reviewed. The inclusion of child endowment when assessing pensioner dependant allowances in such circumstances create a completely false picture of their true financial position and of the factual monetary value of endow ment in general. It does, however, manifest the iniquitousness of this practice to pensioners and their dependants' ur/aTLFvckivnv uuil-UOlUg. H. GOULD, Mona Yale (NSW).
