 Who they are The main public agencies of this serious anti-democratic threat are: the Menzies Government and its political police, the militarist elements of the RSL leadership/the Santamaria political extremists, sections of the press, and a handful of way out academics. The public discussion process has, however, already proved itself strong enough to smoke these anti-democrats out and force them to reveal their position. Last Saturday's TV "teach-in" audience saw B. A. Santamaria, a skilful ideologist of imperialism and war, ducking for cover when his policy was nailed as meaning-, war against any people within 3000 miles of Australia who choose what he regards as a "communist" regime. .No wonder Santamaria's News- Weekly has been de manding that "peacemonges . . . whether sincere or insin cere, must face the full rigor of the law" (July 22).
