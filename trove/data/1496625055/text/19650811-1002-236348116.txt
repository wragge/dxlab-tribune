 Only five weeks to go! Most spectacular increase in points for Popular Sellers this week is from Sydney where Les Murrell (Livepool) has risen from seventh place last week to third this week, increasing his total by 6,250. ANOTHER important increase is from West Australia, where Jack Marks (Workshops and Belmont) has raised his total by 6,033. This is cer tainly the best yet achieved by a Tribune Popular Seller from a factory. The third best increase is by Mar- cia Mitchell (Wharf) Adelaide who increased her total by 4,527 to 13,331. Tribune would appreciate reports on methods used by Popular Sellers and their supporters to gain higher totals.
