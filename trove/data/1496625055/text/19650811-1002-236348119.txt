 £22 basic wag® is a real family need By an Industrial Correspondent '"I® ME marked loss of pur chasing power of Aus tralian workers' wages since 1950 applies not only to the basiic wage but also to mar gins, for which a substantial increase is to be sought. The year 1950 was the last occas ion when for all workers there was an actual increase in the "real" purchasing power of the wage as dis tinct from adjustments to meet price rises or annual increases which left the wage lagging in purchasing power. \ The extent of lost purchasing pow er varies hut some idea of the loss can be gauged from the position- of those many workers and varied oc cupations whose basic wage is the Six Capital Cities Average. Today this wage is £15/8/0. To have the same purchasing power as in 1950 these workers would need a basic wr.ge of £16/2/0 per week. But even this amount is a long way short of a family minimum liv ing wage which several big unions claim should be not less ' than £22. Margins So far as margins are concerned j the ACTU claim is that these should I be restored to the purchasing power ; a-ncl relativity between them which I existed as a result of Metal Trades ! Award standards established in 1947, | and extended to almost all other1 awards. These were the highest amounts j achieved to that time and in pur- I chasing power the highest achieved ; on to now. 1 The base rate tradesman, (e.g. fitter, boilermoker) had his margin increased from 36/- to 52/- per week, almost 50 per cent rise, which made the margin 48.5 per cent of the then current basic wage (6 Capital Cities Average) When the tradesman's margin was first fixed in an award in 1907 it was 18/- and equalled 42.8 per cent of the basic wnae of that time. I ' In 1952 when a claim for increased I margins was entirely rejected, the per- I centce drooped to only 24.8. j Today at 112/- (including the recent 6/- increase) it equals only 36.3 per cent of fhe Six Capital Cities Average basic wage of £15/8/0. Restored to 48.5 per cent of this ba sic wage- the margin would be 150/-, that is 38/- per week more than it is now. But if the basic wage was restored to its 1950 purchasing power, or even to the purchasing power it had in June 1964, it would be £16/0/0 per week and if the margin for a tradesman was restored to 49 per cent of that wage, he would get a margin of £7/16/0 or 44/- a week more than now. On this basis the unions claim that every tradesman and every other worker with an equivalent margin is at least 56/- a week worse off now than when the main post-war Increases were won in the basic wage and margins. NON-TRADESMEN For the great majority of non-tradesmen, the position in relation to margins is in many respects even worse. The 1947 standards raised the trades man's assistant's margin from 12/- to 23/- a week. This 90 per cent increase ; gave him a margin equal to 42.3 per | cent of the tradesman's margin. Today at ' 38/6 the percentage relationship is only 34.3 per cent. If the tradesman's margin was re stored to the purchasing power it had in 1947, i.e. 156/-, and the tradesman's assistant's margin was restored to 42.3 per cent of that sum, his margin would rise from 38/6 to 66/-, an increase of 27/6 a week. Add to this the 14/- by which his basic wage lags behind the 1950 1 purchasing power and every trades man's assistant and every other worker on an equivalent margin is down 41/6 a week on the value of his main post-war wage standards. . Record profits This occurs at a time when profits | ?,re at record high levels and when I the economic capacity of Australia I greatly exceeds the 1947 and 1950 levels. But the 1947 standards of margins were not granted but were terms ! of settlement of a strike of metal | workers agreed to in conference by the employers: increases of 11/-, 13/-, and 16/- on all existing mar gins. The unions agreed to apply to the Court to have these increased mar gins written into the Metal Trades Award. The Court refused to increase non- tradesmen's margins in accordance with the settlement terms. The struggle was resumed, and Concilation Commissioner Mooney further increased the Court's dec ision in accordance with the 11/-, 13/-, and 16/- formula, but warned that the margins then achieved 'were not an assessment by the Ar bitration tribunals. In 1954, the Court threw over board the standards won as a re sult of the 1947 strike and substit uted its own formula making him- gins equal two and a half times what they were in 1937. This gave the fitter an increase of 23/- but left his margin at only 31.7 per cent of the basic wage. The 1954 decision of the Couit followed the basic wage "freeze m 1953 and was another victory employers. . ... Today, the employers, again ju» sisted by the Menzies Government, have launched another attack livings standards. Already some unions are adva cing a demand for a wage Q to a family minimum living £22 plus 1947 margins standaias lated to that family wage.
