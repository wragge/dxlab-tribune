 220 NSW COMMUNISTS SYDNEY: Reports from New South Wales centres show that 220 people have joined the Communist Party of Aus tralia in this State this year so far, Mr. W. Brown, Sydney secretary of the party, said this week. 'MEWCASTLE continues to set the pace for NSW, in . 'act for all Australia", he said. 'They have turned in the great effort of 52 new members to late, well . overfulfilling their original target of 40 for the 'ear. "South Coast has topped its target of 30 (six of these are women) and Sydney District has gained 134 of its target of 170. On a State basis only 30 more new members are needed to reach the year's target of 250. "A very good new development is that new members are reported in a number of centres such as Lith- gow, Katoomba, Broken Hill and other points, showing the campaign to build towards a mass party is taking on throughout the State. "Sydney branches have begun adopting the specific target of two new members by Christmas, while at the same time helping build the Eureka Youth League by each getting one new member for this important socialist youth organisation. "They are getting down to thinking in terms of specific people to be asked. "Members in . all centres are par ticularly asked to report latest new member results, together with reports on interesting experiences," he said.
