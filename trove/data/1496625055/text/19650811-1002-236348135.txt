"The story of your sixteen-year- long struggle for the freedom of your husband, Tony Ambatielos," and your loyalty to each other, does more than this, it renews the confidence of those who know about, you in the basic goodness, of ordinary people . . ... "Leaa-ing about your life has encouraged me to write a story for you and for those others, and for your inspiration i thank you deeply."
