 I Malaysia j 1 THE Malaysian Federation con- j I sisting of Malaya, Singapore, j j Sarawak and Sabah was set up in j i Sentember. 1963. I | British investments in Malaya | | are estimated at Â£500 million and | | it was felt that these (together S I with the Singapore base) were | I best safeguarded by a Govern- I | ment headed by the Malayan = I feudalist princeling "Tunku" Ab- I | dul Rahman and dominating Sin- j j gapore, where militant influence = | was strong, and the Borneo ter- I ! ritories. j | In August, 1963 a conference j j of Malaya, Indonesia and the ! ! Philippines was held in Manila | | at which it was agreed that all j I countries in the area would have I the right to self-determination j j and that bases in the area should j j not be made available for the j puroose of powers outside it. I A United Nations commission j was to enquire into the wishes of the peoples of Sarawak and Sabah. I However, under pressure from ; the British Tory Government the agreement was breached by Mal ayan premier Rahman who an nounced in advance the establish ment of Malaysia. A treaty was signed with Brit ain giving Britain unrestricted rights to use Malaysian bases.
