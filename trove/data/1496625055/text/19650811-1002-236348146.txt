 BUDGET TRAIN CANBERRA: The Trades and Lab or Council in Canberra last week decided to call a four hour stoppage next Wednesday, August 18, and to participate in mass budget lobbying that day at Parliament House. This will enable Canberra unionists to join with other workers from mqpy parts of Australia in the march being organised from Canberra station to Parliament House. Federal officials of the WWF have invited other unions to join a "Budget Lobby Train" to leave Central Station in Sydney on the morning of August 18 — the day after the announcement of the Budget. Mr. M. MacFarlane (secretary of a Combined Unions' Budget Lobby Day Committee) said that delegates from unions, pensioners' and womens' or ganisations are already booking seats on the train. The return fare costs £3/3/5 on the train leaving Sydney at 7.33 a.m. and returning from Canberra on the same day at 5.35 p.m. Mr. MacFarlane said the lobbyists will demand a budget which will put the taxation burden where it belongs, on the wealthy companies and indi viduals, and to lower taxation on tyie working people, increase pensions, , land grant much higher child-, endow- ' ment payments.
