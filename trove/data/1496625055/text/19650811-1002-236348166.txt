 [?] j ; ; — I I Linda McGill's j j epic Channel swim \ By THE CHALLENGER ! I LINDA Mc GILL'S | great channel swim ! has drawn attention to | the need for the Aus- ! tralian Swimming Un- | ion to review its ideas j on disciplinary meas- I ures necessary in the j swimming world. | Miss McGill was banned \ by the ASU for four years | for disobeying orders at | the Tokyo Olympics. \ Though no reason has been I stated by the ASU the .main I reason bandied around is that f "Linda McGill disobeyed orders | not to march at the Olympic | opening ceremony. S Mrs. Wayling, Secretary of the I Housewives' (Progressive) Asso- | ciation of NSW, said that Linda | McGill's great achievement was I a credit to her and to Australian | womanhood. j "Regardless of any little mis- ! demeanor that she is said to I have committed— and haven't j we all at some time or another ! committed them? — I really ! think she has vindicated her. I self. "All honor to her," said Mrs. Wayling. 'I Mrs. N. Hewett, of the Union of Australian Women, comment- j ing on the Channel swim, said: j "We should all congratulate I Linda McGill on her wonderful achievement. j "It is heightened by the- fact that she is the first Austalian male or female to swim the j Channel. j "The UAW have said in the past \ that the ASU should review the penalties of 'the four banned girls I and this should hold now, espe- I cially after such a great achieve- j ment." | Indeed, most Australians will j endorse these comments on Miss | McGill's performance and join in f congratulating her. ! ft j Rocky's chance! j when? | WORLD title fight is still - J j a long way off for Rocky | I Gattellari. j | The possession of a world title j | is very lucrative and Australian | S fight, fans are r obably wonder- j j ing whether , or not the Rock was ! | a bit too impressive and crippled I ! his own chances for a shot at the j I title. | j After all, when a champ de- j | fends his title he wants to be j | fairly sure that he's going to j | retain it, and for this reason | I is usually very careful in his I ! choice of an opponent. j I Probably the one champion j S who cared little about the ability j | of the opposition was Joe Louis, I | who stood out so much in ability j | that he didn't need to pick and | i choose. j ! Joe defended his title so fre- i I quently that -his title defences j 1 were referred to disparagingly as ' . 2 "the bum of the month." Even . I so, Joe met with difficulties j | occasionally. I | As there are no champs around | ! today that can afford to adopt | j the Louis attitude, it would be ? | wise for Rocky to remember I I that although it is one thing to j | paint a good picture of oneself j | in the fight-game, it is entirely » | another thing to sell yourself into. | ! a title fight — especially if yu j j stand a good chance. j I I | - Champions meet again j j in Budapest- j J /"OLYMPIC c I world cham- I ! . pions in seven branches of j j sport will be in Budapest for j 1 the world University Games, , 2 which open on August 20.
