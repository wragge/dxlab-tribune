 [?] 1 pERTH: The Federal i Minister for Transport ! (Mr. Freeth) suffered a critical reception at Perth's Kingswood University Col- lecse "teach-in" debate on j the Vietnam war last I Thursday. 1 His fate was similar to that I of External Affairs Minister i Hasluck, at Melbourne's Monasli ! University "teach-in" two weeks 1 earlier. I Mr. Freeth told the Kinsgwood J audience of students, university I lecturers and a wide section of... I the public: "I came to this teach- | in with something approaching | gloom." J His gloom was justified by the | fact that 700 people took such a | lively interest in a debate on the g Vietnam issues, and was intensi- | fied by their angry reaction to | his smear tactics . ! "Arranged forum" I "This is an ax'ranged forum to | lend respectability to those who S oppose participation in the Viet- I nam war," Mr. Freeth said, ! showing contempt for the distin guished chairman, Rev. Dr. Maddox, of Kingswood College. "Any flimsy argument put forward by Communists will be heard here," he continued. ! "This teach-in is not a healthy (j manifestation of democracy. It will not clear up confusion but S create more." | A roar of disapproval from the | crowd forced him to try to | retrieve his position somewhat. S He "did not brand as Commu- jj nist all who disagreed with the _ ? Government, did not deny the g right to disagree, but ..." i His words were drowned in I cries of "Rubbish!" j It was obvious to all that the J platform of nearly 20 speakers j was a most representative one, | with official speakers from the g Labor Party, Liberal Party, 1 Communist Party and DLP, I lawyers and university lecturers j on the same platform. I The chairman stressed that the | Vietnam question was so impor- | tant that it should be debated in the objective atmosphere of I a university, with speakers pre- I senting a wide field of informa- tion and opinion. ! (Speakers when they were I invited were asked not to debate j other speakers' material, as the | form of the discussion would ! not provide the right of reply.) S Personal attack I Despite this, DLP State Secre- ! tary Martyr launched a vicious j personal attack on the previous j speaker, State Chairman of the g Communist Party, J. R. Gandini, j who had been warmly applauded. S Like Mr. Freeth, Mr. Martyr g bitterly attacked "the many I academics in Australia who knew | the issues but do not make a | stand against the arguments g being propagated by Commu- 1 nists. \ j He intimated that the aca- | demies were misusing the re- ! search facilities provided by | their jobs. | He was proud to be associated | with Santamaria, the National | Civic Council and Industrial j Groups — people who believed in I the United States "alliance," he | said. When he spoke of Mr. Gandini g and others as "enemies of Aus- 1 tralia" the chairman had to call f for order to enable him to con- J tinue. ! "Civs! war " j Mr. Gandini pointed out that I "teach-ins" had originated in | United States, not Peking or | Hanoi. They had spread to | Britain and now to Australia. I In a factual address, he gave | statements from non-Communist | sources showing that the people | of South Vietnam supported the | "Viet Cong," that the war was | a civil war — a war of liberation. ? Australians would be abusing I their freedom if they did not | use it to disagree with the g Government when they felt dis- I agreement, said Dr, A. Rae, of $ the University physics depart- g ment. !
