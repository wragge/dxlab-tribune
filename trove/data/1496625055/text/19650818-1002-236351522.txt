 Message music J AM prompted tQ write to Tribune because of the in creasing popularity of "Message Music" on Sydney's radio stations, particularly 2UW. More and more of this music from both England and America is being broadcast â€” songs such as "God on Our Side," by Bob Dylan, and "Wake Up My Mind", by the Uglies, contain very true and deep messages reflecting the question of opposition to war and racism. I believe this music is being broad cast because it appeals to young people , and it does impart a message to listeners. I would like to see Tribune pub lish an article on this new trend in popular music which, I am sure, would be appreciated by many readers. Graham Gollan, Ashbury (NSW).
