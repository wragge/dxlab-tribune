 Communist alone opposed increase ADELAIDE: At a meeting of the Woody ille Council to consider the annual budget, Councillor Jim Mitchell was the only councillor to oppose an increase in rates. THE rates were increased by 3d — from 2/9 to 3/-. An amendment, supported by four Councilors, to limit the increase to Id, was defeated. Councillor Mitchell in speaking against any increase drew attention to the burdens on Council's revenue as a result of payments made by the Council such as Federal Pay-roll tax £7,140;. contribution to upkeep of fire brigade £8,500; levy for hospitals £14,020, a total of £29,660. He said that because of the absence of Federal Government assistance to State and municipal government Woodville Council would be paying £177,979 in loan repayments and in terest this year. The increase in these amounts was £16,947 over the previous year. The Council's 15 year plan of con struction proposed to spend £3 million from loans. However in the first six years the Council had already bor rowed nearly £2 million. "The repayments of loan money and interest burden from revenue would become an increased burden in the future and underlined the need for Federal assistance", said Councillor Mitchell. In the discussion on the budget there was general agreement on the Council about the unfair nature of the pay roll tax and other statutory charges and a realisation of the dan gers of basing Council work perman ently on loan money. Moves made by the Council for the Municipal Association to seek relief from these payments from the State Government and for Federal assistanf e will be continued. Councillor Mitchell
