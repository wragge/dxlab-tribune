DIXON, national j president, Communist | Party of Australia, said this j last week in an interview s over Sydney radio station | 2G8, where he was lunch- ! eon guest. He had been | asked by commentator I John Pearce: "If Austra- j lia was threatened by one j of the Communist coun- i tries, would your members j ally with the Communist j country?" j Mr.. Dixon said: "In all circum- ! stances if Australia's independ- | ence was threatened we would defend Australia. But Australia I is not in danger from China or | from the Soviet Union, they don't ! threaten us. | "The source of any danger to I Australia is from the penetra- = tion of foreign monopolies. I Wherever military occupation of | a country takes place, the real | purpose in the end, is to secure S control of the economy, and ; I that could be done by the U.S. in 1 Australia without file use of any | soldiers. I "We oppose the Government | on many questions, whether on | foreign or internal policy. i "At the present time we axe | opposed the sending of troops to I Vietnam, so is the Labor Party | and many other people. | "Ibis is a national liberation S war and we do not think Aus- I tralia should be hi that .struggle. , j Our future I ' "We believe our future is I bound up with Asia. We have j to find a different solution ' in j Asia. We think the Menzies' , | Government's policy is wrong 3 | and should be changed." 1 | Q- How Australian is the Party? j For instance the R.SL. will have j S nothing to do with it. 1 A.: We have many members | who are returned soldiers and 1 | some who are members of the j j R.S.L., which is led by an ex- .: | treme right wing group who sup- j port very largely the . Liberal | I Party, so it is not surprising S that they oppose us., | Our policy is based on the 1 interests and needs of the Aus- 2 tralian people, and we. are in- 1 terested in a 'Socialist Australia. | We want to see this country | develop, we want to see its people prosperous, see the wealth 1 1 distributed so that all people 1 benefit from a growing industry 1 and democracy and that our I 1 people get a better education. |H The whole trend in the country I is greater and greater control bv ' monopoly. ' | If you look at the retail busi I ness you will see that distribution of goods is being handled by fewer and fewer companies and ! a great number of small shop. I keepers are being excluded from this particular field of activity The wealth of the country is be- ' ing taken into fewer hands. j Monopoly i Q.: You are not good friends with B.H.P. Would you nationa- | llse General Motors? J A.: We believe ' that all mono polies should be nationalised. I If you take General Motors- j Holden, this company produces cars made by Australian work- ! ing people, but the profit goes to I jl the U.S.A. This wealth should ' M be retained in Australia and this If can only be done by nationalisa- ill tion. jlf Ultimately the people will have jt to nationalise all these indus- j 1 tries so that they become pub- ! 1 lldy owned. Whilst they exist privately people will invest in j them and we don't object to ! that. j Q. How - about labor on the ( wharves? . | A.: Stevedoring in Australia ! should be nationalised. To | achieve socialism, in the end, all industry and means of pro- | duction would be nationalised | and owned by the people. I
