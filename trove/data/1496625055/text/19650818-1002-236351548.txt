 Disaffiliation with ALP in WA AWU should ' reconsider decision pERTH: The West Austra lian Trades and Labor Council on August 3 urged the WA branch of the Aus- tralian Workers Union to reconsider its decision to withdraw its affiliation from the WA branch of the ALP. This automatically involved with drawal from the T.L.C. as well. The T.L.C. urged the reconsid eration "in the light of 'he neces sity for trade union unity in the common struggle 'of the movement to improve the oonditons of labour of W. A. workers." The A.W-U. withdrew affiliation On July Id because of its ''dissatis faction with the administration cf the W.A. branch of the party by the State executive." The union has nearly 12,000 mem bers in W. A. The decision to dis affiliate was made by the branch executive without consulting the rank and file. The executive will renew its decision at its next ex ecutive meeting in January. The Water Supply, Sewerage and Drainage Employees' Union, of 1,600 members, which disaffiliated because it said the A.W.TJ. was trying to gain award coverage of members of smaller unions includ ing the W.S.S.D-E U., is now con sidering reaffiliation.
