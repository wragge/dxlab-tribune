 [?] With Tribune's Industrial Roundsman jtederal Labor Minister McMahou sees interna tional Communism behind the widespread criticism of the recent wage decision by the Commonwealth Arbitra tion Commission. If this argument wasn't so pathetic It would be laughable even though it was made to his friends of the Metal Trades Employers' Association. The Arbitration Commission "is a flexible instrument" and that grounds for decisions could be changed when ever a "genuine log of claims" was filed, he said. There is no doubt about the Com mission being flexible. It changed its wage fixing rules made only a few months earlier pleasing the Federal Government which blatantly submit ted that any increase was "fraught with danger." DANGER TO WHAT? . . . PROFITS! . ? Yes grounds for decisions can be changed. The unions had a modest "genuine log of claims", and asked for 12/- to compensate the workers being robbed through price increases. ; So the Commission removed price increases as a factor in determining wages. ? History recalls that Helen of Troy had a face that launched a thousand ships. Mick Ewer, Amalgamated Engineer ing Union organiser in Sydney, reckons that Borg-Warner Ltd. (auto- . motive products) have an apron that stopped a thousand workers. Recently a worker who secured a work apron was told to take it off. When he did so and threw it on the floor, was given the sack. It took a three days' stoppage to get - the man re-instated without strings.
