 RAIL FREIGHT I INCREASE j LIKELY I pERTH ; The State Govern- j ment is likely to increase j rail freight charges. This j will hit farmers and increase the price of many items to the public. ! The reasons given are: j The rise " in operating cots since the last increase in 1960. The penalties that the Com- j mon wealth Grants Commission I would impose on W.A. if freight j charges here remain below I those in' Victoria. j The first of these holds little val- j idity. The Railways had a subs" an- ' tial operating surplus in each of its I last five years— £986,551 in 1960-61; j £1,750,000 in 1964-65. Much -of the reason for this was increased mech- S anisation, new locomotives etc. | However, the most significant fac- j tor is the increased productivity from \ a substantially reduced staff (in j eight years staff decreased by over S 4,000 workers). | It is interesting to note that the j annual interest payments to private ' bondholders help convert the I £1,750,000 surplus for 1964-65 into a j £3,550,000 deficit. This interest has been paid for 60 years or more. J The stand taken by the Grants Com- j mission— a Federal Government aufh- j ority which makes additional grants S to. W.A. and other small States, re- j fleets the attitude of the Menzies Gov- j eminent. ! It is no credit to the State Liberal j Government that it readily yields to pressure from the Grants Commission j to . raise charges to the public up to J Eastern States' levels — hospital charges and university fees are two other specific cases. j
