 Free speech is JOCK KILBURN, a retired stalwart of the trade union movement, wrote to me last week sending £1 donation to Tribune Fund. It was with regret that I read his personal visiting days are over, for he always had interesting stories to tell. But now he writes: "Well do I remember when 60 years ago I joined a party of international socialists and we ran a special press fund — with drives, euchre parties and straight out donations. "Even in those days we were cal led enemies of our country. They were wrong then and they are wrong now. "The right of free speech, free as sembly and to organise as a party are not privileges to be conceded by any Tom, Dick or Harry, but rights won at bitter costs over the years, by the Chartists, early socialists and communists."
