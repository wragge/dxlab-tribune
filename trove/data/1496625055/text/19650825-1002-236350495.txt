 Couldn't find "capitalism" in the Soviet Union From RUPERT LOCKW03D kOSCOW: Much p.opa- ganda has been peddled1 in the Australian press about the return to some kind of capitalism in the Soviet Union. "We have deliberate ly watched for any evidence and found this not to be true â€” the Soviet people were everywhere determined to build the socialist way of life." This conclusion was stated by the leader of the delegation of Austra lian Transport Unions, Bert Nolan, (secretary, Victoria Branch,. .Seamen's. Union) at the delegations final meet ing vtt leaders of the Soviet trans- port unions .which was broadcast over Moscow radio. The delegation comprised, represen tatives of the Victorian branches of the Seamen's Union, Australian Rail ways Union, Union of Locomotive Snginemen, Waterside Workers' Fed eration, Tram and Bus Employees .'and Transport Workers' Union. Five of the six . delegates were members of the A.L.P. and two are members of the Victorian A.L.P. executive.. In final talks Mr. B. Nolan said, "It's often said that people here have no freedom of speech, thought and movement. Our own observa tions give that the lie. "On -the waterfront and aboard ships we saw automation which would be frightening to workers in our country .because it would ' mean, redundancy and unemployment. Mr. A. Creagan, Australian Rail ways Union industrial officer said: "We were very pleased to see that before automated projects are started workers are retrained: for other trades and never suffered unemploy ment. Mr. E. McCormick, W.W.F. Federal Councillor, said, "If mechanisation pi the scope we have seen on the waterfronts here came to Australia, we would certainly need a mechanis ation fund for compensation to thous ands of displaced watersiders and retiring pensions."
