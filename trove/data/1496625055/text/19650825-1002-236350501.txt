 Walgett1 j segregation I THE Walgett police, according g to a report in the Daily Tele- j graph (August 9), arrested and | locked up University students and I two Aborigines because thqy had g tried to enter . the dress circle of j the Walgett picture theatre. | Subsequently the six arrested | oersons were charged by the police g with obstruction, resisting arrest, ! offensive behaviour and assaulting | . xjlice. I It is noted that those arrested g vere locked in cells before being | barged and bailed out. I From general comment in New- J castle I believe people regard this g action as unconstitutional, as a g British subject must first be charged ! before being locked up. I Quite apart from the deplorable j racism which prevents- Aborigines g from freely entering the Walgett S picture theatre, this action of the I police, if accurately reported, pro- j vides cause for grave concern. j G.M., j Newcastle (NSW). .1
