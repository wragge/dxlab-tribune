 [?] With Tribune's Industrial Roundsman THREE young Liberal up starts, students of the Australian National Uni versity, greeted last Wednes- day's budget demonstrators at Canberra with signs: Send Wharfies to Vietnam" and "Having another picnic in Canberra". This was the big "news item" for the Daily Telegraph while the entire demonstration by 4,000 trade unionists against the budget passed by the Sydney Morning Herald rep resentatives un-noticed. ? As for the young Liberals, young wharfies and apprentices who came on the budget train gave them a hot time and improved their edu cation during a discussion lasting almost two hours. No. the young Libs didn't want to go to Vietnam themselves, they like their leader, Sir Robert, lacked the heart to personally back up reac tionary policies. ? THE National Civic Council is in spiring a McCarthy type witch hunt against all opponents of ' Men- aies economic and foreign policies. A -mate of ours from Tasmania sent this not so old ress cutting: "A matrorily lady hit the ceiling when she was. accused of being a Communist before a US Senate Committee, reports the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. "She cried. 'You call me a Com munist because I once lived in Russia. - "But I'm not. I once lived in Germany, too, but that does hot make me a Nazi.' "Then, as an afterthought, she added, In fact, I've even lived in the Virgin Islands!' "
