 "My Brother Jack" on ABC TV "|"HE ABC is presenting an admirable TV production of "My Brother Jack" (Saturday 8.50 pm, Channel 2) . Based on George Johnston's prize - win ning novel, it captures the spirit of urban life in ' the 1 930's. It is refreshing to see an Australian TV production that ' realistically re flects the life of people during the depression. This kind of reality has a strong appeal for audiences. The standard of production and act ing in the two opening episodes gives promise that "My Brother Jack" may prove to be the most successful of local TV dramas. This success should encourage the ABC to devote more of its time and money to producing other similar drama. Ed Devereux is excellent in the central role of Jack. He recently returned after 15 years In England. It is regrettable that the viewing time clashes with "Homicide" the only other regular Australian drama tic series. â€” Eileen Allison.
