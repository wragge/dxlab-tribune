 tribune 1 1 j jBeware of tlie J 1 Red Herrings I gEWARE Red Herrings, was the title of an editorial in j ) the Western Australian Daily News on August 25> j ! commenting on the proposed "White Paper on Commun- j ! ism". | j "Communism, both internal and external, has a strange I j way of becoming of magnified importance around election j iLtimes!!!,. .say5.jhg„jtprjaj ; _ j j "The Government, unless secure and therefore willing | j- to fight an election on genuine issues — reaches with relief I for the well-worn theme of the Red threat, wins the election j I and then comfortably puts the issue aside". j j The record of the Liberals I in this regafd, says the edi- 1 torial, "has been far from J clean". | With its foreign policy collapsing around its ears, j and in bother over its recent I budget and wage-freezing ! policies, the Menzies Gov- j ernment would very much j like d McCarthyite diver- \ sion right now. " 9 ' I That is why the National J Civic Council, RSL leaders S and the Liberal Party have I raised their clamor for a j White Paper to a new | height. | A Victorian RSL State 1 councillor aave the qame i away when he appeared on Channel 7's session, Fighting j j Words, last Sunday. j J Instead of a White Paper, the councillor, Mr. Bruce I ! Ruxton, wanted a Royal Commission on Communism, to | "expose" the "leaders" of the Communist Party and the j j "Communists" in such organisations as the parents and j | citizens' associations, the universities and the peace move- | I ments. I S I J This, he claimed, was not McCarthyism! | J This" makes it clear that the modern witch-hunters are j I not aiming merely at Communists but at all progressive 1 I people whose activities in the peace movement, or even j ! in the P. Cr C. Associations seeking Federal aid for edtica j I tion, displease the Government. ./ : . j ilt confirms what Tribune said last week — that the I Government is planning a major attack on all its critics — j S on the cherished Australian right to disagree with the ( I Government.. j I ' ' 1 - 2 j While this plan is still; under public discussion, demo- I I cratic Australians should urgently seize the opportunity to j I voice their opposition. j jjL|r.|n y ll — m II DIM. 1 1.1 .IML.I II— M„„ |„|, I 1 1 II .1 .....
