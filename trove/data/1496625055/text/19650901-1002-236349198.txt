Hall and Mr. T. Field. The deputation demanded that the proprietor end all discrimin ation. The proprietor replied that Abori gines could drink in his hotel if they were properly dressed and if they presented themselves to his wife or himself to receive permission. Asked whether this also applied to non-Aborigines, he said that this was only courtesy and applied in all hotels.
