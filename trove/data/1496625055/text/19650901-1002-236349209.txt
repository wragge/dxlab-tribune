 Blues from the Deep South CONNY TERRY and Brownie McGhee, two of the best blues players in America, will visit Australia next month. Sonny Terry from Durham in the Deep South learnt harmonica from his father, a poor farmer. Of his early playing he says: "Mocken' the trains 'bout the first piece I learn . . I used to hear the freight train comin' by. I used to be seiten' down sometime by myself real still an' I'd say 1 wish I could play that. I used to hear my father do it a little bit." Because of two accidents Sonny was blind by the time he was six teen. He says: "After I got handicapped, I useo to go to town ... I used to play on the streets and make money. 3 didn't even carry a stick or noth- in\ Anyway, I'd ust go out and stay out at night twelve, one o'clock v . . aii come home. Oh, just walkin . . . stay in the road Them' cussed roads! Sometimes ten, 'leveri miles at night, walkin', 3 hear a car comin', I git out oil the road. Sometimes I fall in the ditch, git up, keep a-goin'." Sonny had his first big appear ance at Carnegie Hall, in Decern- - ber 1938. In the summer of 1940 he met Brownie McGhee, and their playing of blues and negro music has made them famous. Walter Brown McGhee was born . in Knoxville, Tennessee. McGhee's father took his family from one mill town to the next, seeking work and playing his guitar at parties and dances on Saturday night. When young Brownie wanted to learn music too, his fiddle-playing Uncle John made him a stringed instrument from a tin can. Later, he learned to play on a church organ and sang in a quartet, which would mean that he became aware, of chords, harmony and structure in a different way to Sonny.
