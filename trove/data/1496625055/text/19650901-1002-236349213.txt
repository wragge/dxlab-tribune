 NfW PASSES RECRUIT TARGET SYDNEY: The New South Wales target of 250 new members in the Communist Party of .Australia's "Build Towards a Mass Party" cam- paign has been achieved three montns ahead of schedule. "The biggest contribution to this excellent effort has been Newcastle with 55 recruits," Communist Party spokesman said in Sydney this week. "The South Coast has also passed its target, while Sydney with the big ger total of 170 is within about 15 of its target. "Section committee leaders report rising enthusiasm for the new mem- bers campaign, and are confident that Sydney's will also be overfulfilled by the end of the month. "This is important news," Mr. Brown stressed. "It shows that new members can be won for the Com munist Party providing we rid our selves of old attitudes of hanging back from asking people and setting absurdly high standards in our own thinking of when someone is alleged ly 'right for membership'. "There is a place in our Party for every decent thinking Australian who is concerned about the big issues of our time like the defence of peace; advancement of living standards and the objective of Socialism. "What forms and degrees of activ ity the new member will take up can be decided by how well we help these welcome newcomers once they have joined," he said. "The key thing is, results show that new members can be won. Some Districts and sections have demon strated this in fine style. With every branch and every member in action we can lift the already good result to a really sizable overfulfilment by the end of the year."
