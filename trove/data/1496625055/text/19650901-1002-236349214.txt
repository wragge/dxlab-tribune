 Airlines re-allocation a farce | CYDNEY: An examination of the re-allocation of the air routes in New South Wales by the Menzies and Askin Governments shows it to be a crudely-staged farce in the interests of the An- sett monopoly. The NSW Minister for Transport, Mr. M. A. Morris has just tabled in the NSW Parliament the report of the enquiry into air routes in NSW. The lucrative Dubbo route handed over to East West Airlines by the Renshaw Labor Government goes back to the Ansett subsidiary, Air lines of NSW. The Menzies and Askin Govern ments' ensured that in the re-alloca tion Airlines of NSW received four out of the five most profitable air routes in the State. Four out of the five new route ' given to East West Airlines will be I: a very big handicap to the company. | The managing director, Mr. Shand, said that the transfer td them of v Scone, Forster and Kempsey was a j "hypocritical move to relieve Airlines of NSW of unprofitable services." i He said "The Department of Civil Aviation had been giving considera tion recently to the closure of Forster and Kempsey ait routes because of low passenger demand and operation difficulties. "It should also be realised that , Scone and Forster are so unproduc v tive that the Federal Government had to subsidise Airlines of NSW in re cent years to cover operating losses." The agreement which will now com- : . mence on November 22nd is to be re- \ viewed in 12 months time. . \ This opens the way for further new ( concessions for the Ansett monopoly. j The blatant rigging of NSW air routes in favour of Ansett will inten- . \ â€” sify the sharp differences between p. the Liberal and Country Parties. . . 5 There are very close connections: , between prominent members of, the --1 A NSW Country Party and East West vfo Airlines.
