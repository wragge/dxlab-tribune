 i : : All you have to do I is to ask ! | By June Mills I QNE of Tribune's friends told I me a story- — how he plucked up courage to ask for a dona- i tion to the Fund. "Don't men- | tion any names, please", he I said, "but this is really what happened". il've been taking Tribune to a customer for some months now, and have always been asked into the house for a cup of tea and a talk about what's happening in Australia, but I never thought to ask for a donation to Tribune Fund. "A couple of weeks ago, having read how much was needed to reach | the £4,000 target, I plucked up enough | courage to ask for a small donation. It's really only a question of asking, for I'll collect 2/6 each week. As soon as I reach the ten bob mark I'M bring in the money." If you take heed of this story and asked for a donation, we s? ould make the grade. This week we have received: "Pension, P. B." £1/1 5/0, a. Lett £3/5/0, Dom. per F.O. £1/2/-, Belvue Hotel 7/1/STUC 1 /3, Butch Whprton, Newcastle Trib.
