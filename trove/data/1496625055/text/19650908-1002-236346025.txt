Wood are supplemented | with' the thought-provoking | "TV Needs People's Theatre" ! | by Jim Crawford. | | He says that theatre should be | g accessible to the "average" jj ! Australian. He gives the exam- z I pies of classical Greek and I g the Italian comedy theatre of | ! four hundred years ago which I were usually opened free to | j the public. j How to finance them? | g "Since our national habit of spc- | I culating two bob, or half a g | quid, on lotteries, racehorses, i I pugs, footie teams and spin- i ning pennies is deeply ingrain- g ed, it is only necessary to ; | maintain the existing lottery, R | and launch new ones in all g 1 States to dot Australia with I i people's theatres." f Jim Crawford's ideas should g stimulate a lot of comment. g "Claude Eatherly" a poem by j j Mary Hatfield discloses the j | "burning conscience" of the I I pilot who dropped the bomb j ! on Hiroshima. Craig Powell, I a medical student, examines I j the feelings of his class mates | I in a good sonnet "Medical j | Students." j | Two full-page illustrations by !
