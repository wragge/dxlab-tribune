 WHY THE SHANTY TOWNS? VHAT has created these I humpy towns in west- I em New South Wales? 9 Mrs. H. Hambly, an exe- 1 curive member ot the Abo- g riginal Progressive Asso- 1 ciation, told Tribune that | the Government's assimi lation policy was mainly responsible. This policy tends to work blindly without providing suffi cient preparation for Aborigines entering the European commun ity. j "Formerly, Aborigines lived in communities on reserves where there was good timber, fishing, gardens for vegetables and so on. The government has closed places like Brungle, Pillaga and Cumerunga, even going so far as to turn off the water or pull down the houses Aborigines built for themselves. "In Deniliquin they had water, a telephone and electricity but were forced off the reserve. "There was restriction of movement on these reserves. "Adult men, who were called 'apprentices', worked for 2/6 a week «r»ri the rest of their wages, from 30/- to £2, was put into a trust fund. "There was no strict Tecord of this fund and many of them did not get the money on applica tion. "There was work on the properties but mechanization, though it has increased farm output, has forced the young Aborigines to come to the cities looking for work. The old peo ple are left to mind the children. "There is a three months lay off at least during the year's available work. "In Dubbo you have to wait three weeks for unemployment benefit if work is slack, instead of the usual two weeks. "So the Aborigines left the reserves and, because they were not given proper preparation for assimilation, the fringe towns started to grow.
