 Church concern over proposed White Paper SYDNEY : "It will be a serious day for this coun try when the coercion of contempt and character Assassination are used as weapons against critics of the Government", says a recent editorial iii the "Presbyterian", official organ of the Presbyterian Church. |T went on to say that the production of a Federal Government White Paper on Communism would be un wise. The editorial says: "The recent controversies aroused by Peace Con gresses and the letter of some Aus tralian Bishops reveal a healthy mood for political debate with the Church and a growing readiness among some churchmen to get out of their ghettoes. "At the same time many citizens within and without the church have regretted the tendency of much poli tical criticism to move from spirited debate to the searing process of, branding shepherds of the sheep and members of their flocks. The "Century" says the White Paper would be aimed to "unmask" people under cover of parliamentary privilege. "Menzies' Political Police (SS) never rioted for their accuracy in furnishing their political bosses with dossiers on the 'subversives' will furnish the required material." Those wrongly named would have no legal redress, says Century. "This is a typically shabby tactic pn the part of the Liberal Party. It will, of course, be aimed at genuine Labor men and women who actively oppose the Menzies war- line in- south-east Asia. "It will seek to scare off others who may be inclined to take a non-conformist attitude to the Gov ernment's foreign policy." Century challenges the Liberal party to "do its own. naming" and publish its findings in such a way that those who want to can take court action. The Sydney Jewish News asks, "Why stop at the Communist Party? and demands an exposure of what it calls "othei"' political extremists â€”the "lunatic -fringe" of the type who "sowed the seeds for Aus chwitz". ,
