 ACTU conference on waterfront gYDNEY: An "all-in" eon- ference with the ship owners and the Menzies Gov ernment to deal with water- side workers' claims is to be sought by the ACTU. This decision was made by the A.C.T.U. Interstate Executive at a special session of its meeting in Mel bourne last week. The Executive resolution also said "that the claims made by the Waterside Workers' Federation and the negotiations in connection with them are important to all sections of the trade union movement in the stevedoring industry." Waterside Workers' Federation offi cials had previously conferred with A.C.T.U. officers on their recent cur-, rent dispute with the shipowners. Following these talks the W.W.F. leaders announced suspension of their fortnightly 24-hour stoppages, two of which had taken place. They referred their dispute to the- A.C.T.U. and sought convening of a meeting of the Interstate Industrial Disputes Committee provided for in the A.C.T.U. rules. This Committee consists of the Executive Sub-Committee (mainly the four officers) and "duly appointed representatives of organisations who are likely to be involved in the dis pute." Instead of this meeting the Execu tive decided to intervene in the dis pute under powers conferred on it under another rule, and to seek the "all-in" conference with the Govern ment and the shipowners. If this conference is rejected or is unsatisfactory, a strong demand will arise for early convening of the Interstate Disputes Committee.
