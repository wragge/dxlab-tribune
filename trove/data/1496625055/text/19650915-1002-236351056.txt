 Pensions AS an ex-serviceman I have had two pensions for years — £12 a fortnight plus 50 per cent war disability £6 per fortnight. Recently I let rooms in my home for £4/15/- a week and also had £309 in the bank. A short time later a person called and requested permission to value my modest home on behalf of the Department. later I was notified that my ser vice pension was reduced from £12 to £9/0/6 a fortnight. Thinking it was the rent from letting the rooms that caused the pension reduction, I immediately gave the tenants notice. On protesting to the Department I was informed that receiving the rent made no difference to the pen sion, what mattered was -the war pension, value of the house (V.G.'s valuation £1,800) and having £309 in the hank. There are thousands of diggers receiving service and war pensions. Are they all being treated alike or am I the hunny? Moral, don't go to war. ' W. H. Beauchamp, Nowra (N.S.W.).
