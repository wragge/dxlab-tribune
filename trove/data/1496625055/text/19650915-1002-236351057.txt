 "Message UEBBHBBBBnmm music'1 waaBHasB8BnD Â¥ AGREE entirely with Mr. Gol- lan (Tribune) 18/8/65 in his praise of the "message music" that has currently received a boost on Sydney radio. Some of the "messages" are very much accepted and appreciated in the youth, and I feel that this is a feather in the cap of the peace movements of both Australia and the U.S.A. Favorites like Pete Seeger and Joan Baez have been going for ages, but it is only occasionally that they come up with a song that really takes off in teenage circles. It is therefore a great relief when one hears this type of music regularly on the commercial radio. The great advocate of this music is of course the one and only, Bob Dylan, a man who is now enjoying enormous popularity the world over. (Although in the words of a cer tain 2UW announcer, "This music is the product of a very confused mind"). However this acceptance may be the repercussions of a non-confor mist society and therefore we must not "bask in reflected glory" until the Disarmament Treaty is signed, if need be with pressure from be low. But I must admit we do have something on our side when a song containing the words: "You're old enough to kill But too young to vote And I tell you over and over and over, again, My friend, but you don't believe we're on The Eve of Destruction." can hit the top of the American charts ...
