 Fund passes £3000 By June Mills AA/HEN you've set a goal a long way ahead and can just see over the hill, you heave a siqh and think "now we are really on the way". That is the stage the Titiune Fund has reached. We are over the £3,000 mark and on the way to the 1965 target of £4,000. This week we appreciate very much the donation from Katharine Pri- chard, all the way from Perth and also welcome other donations from outside Sydney, including one from far away Darwin. Butch Wharton is well again and writes about the donation this week that a young Scottish University fellow gave him the £1 in memory of Willie Gallacher. Glad you are well again, Butch, and able to keep up the good work of selling Tribune each week and collecting for the fund.
