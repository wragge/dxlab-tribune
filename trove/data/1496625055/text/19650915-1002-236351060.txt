 [?] "Kill by Shock" rifle horrifies all decent people in the world "THE decision to equip units of the United States and Australian forces in Vietnam with the "Kill by Shock" rifle will horrify decent peo ple throughout the world. Parents and wives of Australian soldiers sent to Vietnam will be specially alarmed. This new rifle "The Armalite" is far worse than using "Dum Bum" bullets outlawed by the Geneva Con vention. The Armalite rifle apparent ly has no rifling in the barrel, thus allowing the hullet to "tumble" end over end and strike side on. Whereas a .303 would make a small hole the Armalite bullet when it hits side on could tear an arm or a leg right off. "The Australian" (Aug. 20) stated: "The 'Armalite' less than 3 ft. long with an exceptionally high muzzle velocity fires a bullet with a tumbl ing action, capable of inflicting seri ous wounds at even slight contact. The velocity is so high that a hullet from the 'Armalite' striking a man on the ankle could kill him through shock." As the National Liberation Forces use mostly captured weapons and ammunition, this means that these frightful weapons could be captured and used against our own trooos. T.L., Sydney (NSW).
