 Opposition to wool scheme DELAIDE: A move to oppose the reserve price marketing plan for wool at a meeting of the SA Stock- owners' Association while successful by a narrow maj ority, showed sharp division in that organisation. i At the same time there is wide spread opposition to the views advanced by Mr. R. J. McAuley, chairman of the Free Wool Market, Committee, who is critical, of the reserve price marketing scheme. The Stockowners' meeting was at tended by about 100 of its 2,600 " members and the vote of 119 to 98 included proxy votes. Some of the State's wealthy pas- toralists, such as Sir Richard Hawker arid P. A. McBride, supported, the stabilisation scheme despite Mr. McAuley's assertion that it would start the wool industry along "a certain path to nationalisation." In a letter to the press the General Secretary of the SA Wheat and Wool- growers' Association, Mr. T. C. Stott, MP, replied to the views of Mr. McAuley. He, said that specific details of the plan had been given to growers The International Wool Textile Organisation had carried a : resolution in support of a stabilisa tion scheme.
