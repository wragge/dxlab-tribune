 Challenge to BHP railway DELAIDE: Raftwaymen at Port Lincoln are cam paigning for the new BHP Port Lincoln-Coffin Bay rail- way to be owned by the State Government. In a letter to members of the South Australian Parliament, the Port Lincoln branch of the Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen seeks support and action towards this end. The letter says: "The Playford Government sold out the State to the BHP over the Coffin Bay lime sands deposits and the Coffin Bay - Port Lincoln railway. "There was promise of action to reverse that decision and ALP deci sions requiring some positive action. "We railwaymen stationed at Port Lincoln imposed a ban on the hand ling of materials for the new rail way, but lifted it at the approach of the elections. We are concerned at the apparent lack of any opposi tion when it was anticipated that there would be political action initiated. "The ceding of the railway to the BHP causes us concern because the operation of that project would have been a source of profit for 'the Government-owned railways and en sured balanced and continuous em ployment for us.
