 OUR BIGGEST GIFT-£iOOO! yHE largest single donation ever received by Tribune - £4,000 — was given last week by the paper's long-standing friend, D R. A. Y. Still preferring to restrict his idontity to those initials,, he 8 told Tribune that the recent arrive1 of his T" birthday had convinced him he should take this step. He considered th« the Liberal Party scheme for a "White Paper on Communism" might soon be used to start a witch hunt in Australia against all who have different ideas from those of the Federal Govern - Iment on peace, foreign and home policy and that support for Tribune would greatly aid the defence of democracy. As far back as the days of appeal for medical aid to Rus sia in World War II D.R.A.Y. was donating liberally to the cause of peace, and using the initials Y.A.R-D. and D.R.A.Y. has given generously to Tribune Fund for many years, with donations of up to £100.
