 TRIBUNE FAIR ON OCTOBER 23 Just over one month remains before the 1965 Tribune Fair is held at 168 Day Street, Sydney. ALL. helpers are urged to swing l into top gear with goods and donations tor the blq da v. "Deep" branch has volunteed 4 help ers. Glebe is already making "T" shirts, small frocks and shopping bags— the material was donated by Glebe neigh bours. Glebe suggests that the popul ar 6d children's "lucky dip" be com menced, and supporters could begin wrapping toys, rings and ornaments etc. Any volunteers? Cumberland Section is to make a number of wooden rockers and hob by horses for children. Waverley is concentrating- on food and toys. In East Sydney. 2 Section organisers will be checking on branches' activity. Blacktown is looking for material for a sewing bee— any donations will be gratefully received. We have a surprise money-spinner which would need to be handled by one branch — how about being rep resented at next Fair meeting? First in first served— it's a pleasant and easy one to make lots of money for the air. The wharfies are planning some cane baskets: last year they sent in some good canework. There have been no garden plants organised as yet. The work done previously with plants etc. was a good money spinner. Helpers are needed to prepare, and to clean up on the day as well as man ning stalls. Madge and Fred O'Grady will be organising their Hoop-la stall and &lt; have already booked for same. Tribune supporters are asked to seriously consider some form of don ation, as this is a practical way of assistance to Tribune and our struggle for Peace and Socialism. Thanks for the box of shoes all newly soled and heeled. All progressive people can play a part in making this year's Fair a mighty success. —ron marriott
