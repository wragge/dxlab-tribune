 First-hand on India, Pakistan T WOULD like to record my appre ciation for the people of India and Pakistan. My particular friends were Punjabis and Kashmiris. As a very young, inexperienced soldier I was in charge of a small troop of these two races. I found them kind, helpful arid only too willing to help a young "sahib" till he grew sufficiently experienced to stand on his own feet. Later in life I lived in various parts of India. I had friends every where I went. Indians and Pakistani, like all others, respond normally to fair and honest treatment, and I sin cerely hope that mass genocide does not occur and their war will soon end. May they, Moslem and Hindu, reach peace, understanding, friend ship and co-operation to obtain the comfort and standard of living that .people the world over desire. J.M. (Matraville).
