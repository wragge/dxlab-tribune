 Ask the peasants in Vietnam JTENZIES Government apologists claim that if North Vietnam would "cease its aggression" agairist the South, guerilla activity against oaigon regime would be so weak that the fighting would he all over. This is a lie that can easily be nailed. The first major revolt by the Vietnamese peasants was in 1940 in the Mekong Delta â€” 1,000 miles from Hanoi, in the extreme south. That was before any peasant revolts in the north. Villages that led that revolt are among the leading centres of struggle today. The first armed resistance against France's attempt in 1945 to re conquer Vietnam started in the Mekong Delta. The first armed struggles against Diem, when he attacked villages in 1955, was in this region. A major issue today is, as against the French, land reform. The Mekong delta is said to be the richest area in Vietnam, with 3:1 million acres of ricefields, of which 90 per cent, were owned by absentee landlords. But the liberation move ment south of the parallel has, among other things, ensured that over half of . the population in the countryside now own their own land as a result of their own land reform. How can there be any other result of the struggle in Vietnam except the ultimate departure of foreign troops and a settlement with the Liberation Front partici pating? E. Maher (Sydney).
