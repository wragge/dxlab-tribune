 Race-hate charge: J ; t Leibler attacks fascist migrant I groups "IpHE Public Relations Choir- man of the Victorian Jewish Board of Deputies (Mr. I. Leibler) has accused a group of extremist migrant organisations in Australia of "actively promoting anti- Semitism behind a smoke screen of anti-Communism". In an article in the September 17 issue of the Australian Jewish Herald, Mr. Leibler draws attention to a publication entitled "Newjs Digest International" published by these fascist-style bodies. Issue No. 3, 1965, of News Digest Internationa contains an article by one J. P, Kedys in which he: Rails against Australians "who follow the example of U.S. rabbis (sic) by campaigning against the presence of Australian troops in South Vietnam." Describes the New United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Dr. Goldberg, as "a typical left- winger . . . who on many occasions supported Communist claims in ' ' court." Mr. Leibler says that it is no acci dent that an Australian hate peddler like Eric Butler of the League of Rights is quoted with approval by News Digest International. Butler was reported as addressing a rally in Sydney sponsored by A.B.N., an international fascist - slanted body which includes among its leaders known quislings and war criminals. He gives this warning: "With the exception of the insig nificant lunatic fringe, most Aus tralian anti-Semites, sensing the general revulsion to racial hatred in this country, are operating on some what more sophisticated lines. "Kedys and his associates do not come out with open incitement to hatred and bigotry. Instead, taking advantage of the present tense inter national situation, they present them selves as dedicated democratic refu- gees from Communist tyranny and peddle their anti-Semitism behind a facade of anti-Communism. Mr. Leibler makes it clear that most migrant bodies are democratic in outlook, and should not be con fused with these fascist-style splinter groups.
