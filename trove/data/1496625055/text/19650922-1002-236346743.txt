 White Paper and Libs' fear DY joining the far-right fanatics (Santamaria, Wentworth, Killen and others) in clamor for a White Paper on Communism, the Liberal Party leadership have made one thing clear. They must be desperately con cerned at public reaction against Australian intervention in the ag gressive U.S. war against the Viet namese people, against Mr. Holt's class-biased Budget, and trade union reactions to the Arbitration Commission's wage freeze in which the government is implicated. The idea is to label all such opposition as Communist. The Communist Party is a legal political party whose legality has been upheld by a referendum of the Australian electors. Its policy and activity is public and open. When the Liberal Party recently pub lished its pamphlet on Vietnam, the Communists answered it and challenged the Liberals to debate the issues openly, but they were evidently afraid to face such a public debate. Instead they want to use public money to slander the Communist Party and also all others who oppose the government's policy. For example, Mr. McMahon re cently stated that trade union op position to the wage freeze was "part of a trial of strength by international Communism." This is a form of McCarthyism, seeking to develop an atmosphere of hysteria, to intimidate all op position. Sydneyite.
