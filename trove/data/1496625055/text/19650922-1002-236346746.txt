 [?] "Drastic" rate rises following new land valuations The people in the Newcastle region are receiving their rate notices from the Hunter District Water Board and criticism appears daily in the press of the drastic increases, based on the increased assessed annual value of properties. rjEMANDS are made for a Change TO rating un me unimproved capital value of land or to rating x on the amount of water used, in the belief that homeowning rate payers would be relieved of much of their burden.. But if responsibility is still forced upon ratepayers to meet the total rate revenue of the Water Board (or Council) they would still carry the burden, under whatever system of levying rates is adopted. The Hunter District -Water Board, for example, receives £3& million from rates levied on the AAV (Sydney Metropolitan Water Board gets about £23 .million). Unless - supplementary means of finance are made available to the Board, it would, in order to get its re quired total revenue, have to in crease the rate in the £ tinder UCV or increase the charge for water used, if that system were adopted, to a point that would still impose the burden on ratepayers. The burden on ratepayers, it seems, can only be relieved by finance grants for Local Govern ment being made available from the national revenue, into which all taxpayers subscribe, including about 45 per cent, of people over 21 years who, as non-property owners, don't pay rates. The demand for 10 per cent. of. the national revenue for Local Government will be a major point in the policy of Communist candi dates in the Council elections to be held on December 4.
