 JSi®Neaderi|| under heavy lire in SA | ADELAIDE: The Federal i leadership of the Aus I J tralian Workers' Union ' 1 came under fire at a 1 ! ing of rank and file mem- I bers held in the Trades I j Hall. I I S.A. branch officials also came I in for their share of criticism, j I These officers were appointed j | by the Federal executive to re- j place those who had won posi- ! I tions at a recent election. | ( The meeting protested at the I refusal of the general secre- | tary (Mr. T. Dougherty) to ob- | serve the union rule which en- ! titles members to petition for an extraordinary general meeting. S.A. officials, it was stated, had also ignored the rules by | refusing to call a meeting in j accordance with, the wishes of | union members. j The purpose of calling for a I general meeting was to discuss I the Federal executive's attack upon the Australian Labor Party I and matters relating to the union I rules. i I Another indication of the I ! vgrowing dissatisfaction of AWU | members with Dougherty leader- | ship is a recently produced leaf- | let which points out that failure I of the leadership to keep wages | up to the level of Australian | Council of Trades Unions' gains i has cost shearers alone about £3 | million in wages since 1959. | The new pastoral award robs | shearers of £304,000 as a result I of the loss of the 4/- per 100 j "special allowance" included in | the 1956 strike settlement. | The award also grants employ- | ers the right of wage confisca- 1 tion in the case of shearers j leaving the. shed before com- | pletion of his agreement. (Even when employers did not ! have this right, AWU head office had claimed that they did. The new pastoral award is des- I I cribed by the leaflet as the I | worst since the depression. j
