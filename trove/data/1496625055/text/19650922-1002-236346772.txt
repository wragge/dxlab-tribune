 [?] ! pORT KEMBLA: The young ! giant pictured above is Mick Wakefield, a weight- lifting champion and one of Australia's strongest men. He recently defended his I title with a total of 7151b | in three lifts. I A few days ago the Australian | Stevedoring Industry Authority re- ) jected his application to work on !the wharves. The ASIA refused to gave a reason as to why they would not register him as a waterside work- j er. ! Wharfies work pretty hard, but | surely Mick would be strong enough to do it. So that can't be the reason he was rejected He is a married man with a young wife and two children, he is a respected member of the Wol- longong Police Boys' Club where he has coached the young lads. He has lived in the district for many years and is a credit to it as a citizen and an athlete. So they can't have rejected him because of his character. The secretary of the New South Wales South Coast District Com mittee of the Communist Party, is Mr. W. McDougall, one of his daughters is the wife of Mick Wakefield. Could this be the reason that the ASIA deems Mick unsuited to work as a wharfie? I Moves by the ASIA to interfere I with the long standing right of the j Waterside Workers' Federation to | recruit its own members, to work 1 on the wharves, began recently I when wharfies in Sydney and f Port Kembla held a four hour ? protest stoppage at the ASIA'S re- J jection of seven applicants in Syd- I ney. ? One of those rejected was Mr. j Simon Morcom whose mother is I an active member of the Comtnun- j ist Party. His father Don Morcom, j once a full-time worker for the 1 Communist Party, worked on the | Sydney waterfront for several years I prior to his death. j
