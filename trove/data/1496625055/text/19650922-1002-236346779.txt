 Unions re-affirm 35 hour policy SYDNEY: The Australian Council of Trade Unions Congress last week reaffirmed its 1957 decision to demand the reduction of the working week from 40 hours to 35 hours without loss of pay . "INCREASING mechanisa- tion and automation and the growing development of new trends, materials and processes in industry and commerce emphasise the in creasing urgency for the achievement of this demand/1 Congress said. Labor Councils are called on to establish standing committees to ensure that continued attention and action is given to this campaign. Mr. w. Parkinson (general presi- dent Miners' Federation) seconded the resolution from the executive and said: "We are no further forward today than we were in 1957." In a spirited address he drew atten tion to the fact that some ACTU of ficials had criticised sections of the workers, shop committees, and the Communist Party. "But I have not heard one ACTU official at this Congress talk about the main enemy of the Australian peopleâ€” monopoly capitalism. "I know the ACTU is called to fight on many fronts such as wages, penal powers, equal pay, etc. "But not one of thse issues can he divorced from monopoly capitalism. "The Arbitration Commission is not the enemy it is only the instru ment." Mr. Parkinson said that in 1954 there were 154 mines in N.S.W. owned by 110 different companies. Now there are 88 mines and 51 per cent of the coal is produced by three monopoly groups. ' He said that the "Financial Review", has disclosed that over seas capital now control the key sections of the Australian economy. "McEwen (Deputy Prime Minister) said we were selling our heritage. "But our leaders have not men tioned monopoly capitalism." Mr. Parkinson said the history of hours in Australia is a history of struggle. This is how we won the 40-hour week," he said.
