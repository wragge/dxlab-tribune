 Transport men yv handling of the recent NSW transport strike filled me with shame at the falsification by com mentators as to the easy flow of traffic, and as to the manner in which the working population was able to arrive at their place of employment. It would appear that the deficit shown by all Government transport departments each year could be eliminated merely by dismissing all I transport personnel and placing the entire fleet of buses as well as all j suburban trains in the Museum. Who are they to say that the transport workers do not deserve a better deal? > What hope has the worker of re- I ceiving a "fair go" by arbitration? Go back to the last basic wage I request, when two judges stated we j were, by virtue of the C series index I entitled to at least 8/- increase, but the other three, whilst agreeing that the C series index had risen by 11/- to 12/- per week, denied any in crease, merely stating the economy could not stand it. I will not deny that we have on many occasions improved our living standards by virtue of arbitration, but when these channels have been explored with negative results there 1S no alternative other than direct action, and all my sympathy is with the Transport Workers. .
