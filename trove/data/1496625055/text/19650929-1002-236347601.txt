 South Vietnam LENDING of Australian troops to South Vietnam as a junior part ner of the United States will bring ill-will, distrust and abhorrence to- wards Australian foreign policy as a whole. This dirty war of intervention is another demonstration of US foreign policy previously applied in Cuba, Korea and elsewhere. The US dollar is impregnated with the blood of colonial peoples. Raw materials — rubber from Vietnam, sugar from Cuba, minerials from Korea — have much to do with it. It is a disgrace to Australia's national reputation that some of the best sons of the Australian people should be sacrificed in such a dirty war to uphold US interests. If the US 'exports' its wars to countries in which it has vested interests then some day they will turn the belligerence toward us. Our foreign policy is bankrupt because it denies peaceful solution of any war situation which is backed bv American foreien uolicv. Supporter (Leichhardt, N.S.W.)
