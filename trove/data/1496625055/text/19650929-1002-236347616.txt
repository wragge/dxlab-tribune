 [?] JYDNEY: An attack on I the wharfies is an at- j tack on the whole trade I union movement, said I l workers at a metal shop in j | Sydney this week. j j During an off-the-cuff | | interview with Tribune (see J i picture) , workers at Steel- j bilt (Waterloo) said: "If j the employers and the | Menzies Government get I I away with their attack on j j the Waterside Workers' j | Federation, other unions 8 | will be next!" ! 1 Jack Kingsley (Sheet Metal | 1 Workers' delegate) pointed out | J that wharfies are always willing g Iand ready to help other work- 8 ers when in struggle. | "During a 14 weeks' strike at | Steelbilt in 1954 the Sydney g wharfies took around the hat for us every pay day," he said. | He added: "The W.W.F. is one j g of the most prominent unions, j | The first stepping stone to at- 1 ! tacks on all workers is to smash | !the militant unions." g Back them! I S All seven men interviewed I said the Australian Council of g I Trade Unions and the Australian ! s Labor Party should "back the I wharfies 100 per cent." j !A morning smoko mass meet- j ing earlier that day had unani- | mously called on the ACTU by i telegram to give full backing to g the W.W.F. 8 S Jack Carrol (storeman) said: | jj "The whole trade union move- | j ment has a real fight on its j hands. | I "Minister for Labor, McMahon, J f wants to deregister the Federa- g g tion and if he gets away with S ! i,t he won't stop with the whar- | j fies." j | Eddie Tourle (toolmaker) g | said: "The ALP is supposed to be I J a workers' party. It should now j j give a firm lead to resist this g j attack on unionism." 8 I Perc Ryman (toolmaker) said g ! he once worked for the Mari- g I time Services Board. "I know 8 ! wharfies struggle for higher g j wages and conditions." | I- "This is why they get at- g g tacked," Eddie put in. | j "White Paper" j I Tom Lilly (storeman) said the g g wharfies are only striving for \ ! better conditions. "The ACTU j | has been weak at times, now g | they must be solid." . 8 ? Jack Thornton (sheet metal I I worker) pointed out that Labor g | M'HR. Dr. J. Cairns, had warned g g the budget demonstrators re- | I cently in Canberra that the Gov- | | ernment was introducing legisla- g g tion aimed at attacking the trade 8 = union movement and the "White I » Paper against Communism" was g | also a plan to attack civil g | rights. I ! Jack said a mass meeting in j j the factory last week had con- g g demned Menzies' White Paper g 8 scheme and had called on ALP 8 ! leader, Mr. Calwell, to oppose it. g | "The ACTU should know that g I this so-called White Paper and 8 I the legislation against the f jj wharfies is part of a national £ j campaign against the workers," g 8 Jack said. !
