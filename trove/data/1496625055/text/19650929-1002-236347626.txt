 "Walk Before" I ""HIS letter in prose was written by Jack Healy on how j a young Vietnam girl may feel. J DEAR MR. PRESIDENT, x j 1 am a young Vietnamese girl aged ten. I live in North Vietnam I and was there when your planes flew over and dropped their gifts ! of soap and toys for distribution among our girls and boys. j I hear they floated down by little parachutes, and what a sight 1 they must have been. I must apologise, dear Sir, and explain the I pity of it all— they were not seen! j You see, we've learned that when your planes do blot our sky, j unless we hide away, the chances are we die. j Of course, when your planes had gone, there was much clamour and very great relief, for this time there were no bombs and blasts I and burning— and no grief. j But I stayed where I was and left behind and listened as the | others made their find. I P . I You see, kind Sir, I no more walk or run, I lost my legs when i j your raids first began. But still 1 saw the gifts you sent to me, j I a bouncing ball— a skipping rope— a cake of soap. You say the soap j j is used by nine of every ten; quite obviously that soap is not for j | me, for with no legs the tenth I'm doomed to be. $ And should you to this letter deign reply, I wonder, Sir, if you could J tell me why, when your planes come and drop their bombs and | jelly fires, your statesmen have to be such awful liars to tell the I world your planes drop bombs on targets made for war, and yet | the toys were dropped where bombs were dropped before. | I'm sorry, Sir, but I must hasten my goodbyes, I hear the planes j and fear it's bombs not toys. | Yet I remain a friend in peace, but not in war, the little girl I who used to I WALK BEFORE. j P.S.— I ask your pardon, dear Mr. President, if this page with tears j is wet — in vnill Inst, mid mv mntlmr diod and T liict fian't foreet. ? y — "V » U" - W.B. j _ . ||M u u .
