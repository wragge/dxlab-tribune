 V | Extra £s to 1 cope with Ss ! I s I YDNEY: A demand kas I | been made on four J J States for an extra £5 a | week for railwaymen handl- j i ing cash, to compensate | | for the added burden of j I dealing with problems of | I the currency changeover g J next year. I | "C Day" is on February j 1 14, 1966. | | In a news release last week the j J general secretary of the .Aus- | | tralian .Railways Union, Mr. M. | g O'Brien, said that the ARU had g S served the demand on the "Com- 1. | missioner for Railways in New I j South Wales, Victoria, South j I Australia -and the Transport g Commission, Tasmania. ! S ;Mr. O'Brien said the Railways | I will change over .immediately on g | "C Day" and employees such as S I booking clerks, .stationmasters, I J etc., who are handling cash will j | be responsible for ensuring that g g the travelling public are aware I I of the difference between deci- j | mal currency and our present J J currency. | . g He said that on "C Day" the g I general public would not have I | dollars and cents and conse- 1 i quently there was likely to be. j some confusion and .possibly g , irritation between the travelling I : J public and railway employees f ; for some time. g I ' .The Union believed that the g | additional responsibility which I .| railway employees would have j | to accept entitled them to addi- g I tional remuneration &lt;by way of ! I an extra allowance for at least | J a period of six months. | I "The Union will also ask the | : | respective Railway Commission- i I ers to provide a special fund to 1 j meet genuine shortages in cash j '! which must inevitably arise with g . j the change in currency," he said. f 1 | "If the Railway Commissioners I ! reject the demand for the in- j creased allowance of £5 per week g | it is the intention of the Union j i to refer the matter to the Arbi- | g tration Commission so as it can g I be resolved prior to "C Day." !u— — —
