 Sport and Health JN the Soviet Union physical culture and sport are regard ed as a means of improving the health of people; in this respect the trade unions play a very im portant role. The extent of the part played by the trade unions can be gauged from the 8th Summer I Sports Tournament of Soviet Trade Unions, the finals oi | which took place at the Lenin I Stadium, Moscow, last month. I The 7,000 top sportsmen and 1 sportswomen who took part in u the finals, were the result of s V three stage tournament, I They were -finalists of the 15 million competitors who parti cipated. The first stage was the pre liminaries that took place at the technical schools and institutes, farms, factories and offices. The second stage covered the tournament at city, region, ter ritory and republic level. The last stage was the finals. A very significant aspect underlying this colossal tourna ment was that not one of the original competitors had an itoa of worry about not having equip ment or facilities with which to train. In the Soviet Union both the Soviet Olympic Committee and the trade unions take an ac tive part in guiding sport. They spend money at their command on popularising sport among factory and office workers. There are 36 sports societies in the Soviet Union and any one wishing to take up sport may become a member of e socity, wear its sports unifonn and use its sports facilities, for an annual membership fee of about 30 kopeks — aboui three' shillings. The great advance in sports and physical fitness activities is the direct result of their way of life — Socialism.
