 [?] From RUPERT LOCKWOOD in MOSCOW NYONE out to make a fast rouble should keep well away from Soviet racecourses. Our daughters have alwa.v crazy about horses, so to the Mos. cow races we went. One daughter surveyed the horses from studs all over tfc USSR, as they warmed up for the first race and arbitrarily decreed No. 2 was best. On went the roubles at tote for No. 2 to win. .(There are no place bets: this should lift the pay- out on the winner). ! You've guessed the result: No. 2 i led all the way, and slowed down i at the post for a seven-lengths vic tory. The tote odds? Ten to seven on! |T might seem that where joc keys don't have stiff arms and trainers "no pep pills, any mug punter can pick the winner. For the record ,the next horse picked in this arbitrary manner ran nowhere. But where races are fair dinkum, winners are Much easier to pick and the odds even shorter than those allowed by Australian bookies. A visit to the Moscow races is well wor.th while. Conventional races, steeplechases and Trots are on the same programme, in quick succession, and In the centre are jumping and riding contests. # THE average Muscovite requires half an hour each way to get to work and back. Transport improve ments will, it's hoped, cut the time in half. Forty per cent of Moscow tra vellers will be going by underground Metro in 1970; new 60 m.p.h. trains will run at intervals of 75 seconds to the - fast-spreading outer suburbs, electronically directed. New Metro tunnels are being driven to the outer suburbs at speeds of up to 435 yards a month. # THE Friendship Pipeline from the Volga has already carried 25 million tons of oil to Czechos lovakia, German Democratic Re public and Hungary— a transPor! saving of no less than ">» freight trains.
