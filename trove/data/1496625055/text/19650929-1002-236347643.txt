 [?] 1 IDE by side on the editorial page of the august Sydney Morning Herald on September 22 appeared two articles. One painstakingly took Sir Robert Menzies to task for his "angry" rejection of the; Vernon Report on the Austra lian Economy. Sir Robert was guilty of "discourtesy" to five able leaders of Australian capitalism. (Vernon,, as CSR head,. has close links with, the "Herald" I;. Sir Robert was "wrong' . If Menzies,, with his pathological hatred of any criticism of "free enterprise" and his "White Paper" mentality, had' branded the Vernon committee as crypto-communists or socialists ( because of its recommendations for limited econ omic advisory, and planning machinery) it would not have been surprising. Doubtless the Herald's criticisms would then have been all the. sharper and' rightly so. What is interesting,, however, is that the second article — one of a series of four titled "A cool look at Communism", by renegade communist Fred: Well's — displayed in much worse form, characteristics for which Menzies was criticised'.. Here were, trotted out all the old,, unreasonable fabrica tions; of "Moscow control" of the Communist Party of Aus tralia, the wrong "facts" supposedly revealed to the public although the real facts have never been concealed, the "dis courtesy" and slander against honorable and patriotic Aus tralians. Wells himself, has no professional prestige: to lose; but the accepted, editorial prestige of the "Herald" can only suffer because of such rubbish and such' a careless approach to a se-ious political, issue.
