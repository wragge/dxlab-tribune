 ACTU Congress wants boycott on S. Africa SYDNEY: The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions will be called on to re-examine whether a world-wide trade union boycott could be imposed on the handling of South African goods. pHE decision for a world boy cott was unanimously car ried at the Australian Council of Trade Unions7 Congress in Sydney. Congress gave ACTU president, Mr A. Monk, a mandate to call for such a boycott at the ICFTU executive . meeting to be held in October. It was also further resolved to intensify the 1963 Congress decision which called for a consumer boy cott on South African goods in accordance with trie ICFTU depision. Congress stressed that the people and workers of South Africa have , been and are living and suffering under a police state regime and under conditions of the most shock ing racial discrimination, with, forced labour, actual massacres and terror ;as their lot. Despite this regime of violence and | the use of all possible police methods to silence public opinion, and de spite the ruthless oppression to which active trade unionists and trade union organisations are ex posed, the workers and' the people of - South Africa, in opposition to this policy, are waging a determined and heroic batle against their oppressors against apartheid and racial disv crimination. As this Congress stands in strong condemnation and hostility at these actions, we direct the ACTU Execu tive officials to make representations by deputation to the Commonwealth Government to initiate and support in the United Nations Assembly world-wide sanctions, including diplomatic, economic and an arms embargo on South Africa and such decision could he immediately im plemented by the. Australian Govern, ment.
