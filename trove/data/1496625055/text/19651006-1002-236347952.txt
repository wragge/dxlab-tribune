 THE LETTER OF CONSPIRACY In 1954 the WWF proved the conspiracy between the Govern ment and the shipowners. A letter signed by Mr. A. Van Bookove, general manager for Australia of the Royal Inter-Ocean Line to his head Office was read to 5000 wharfies at a stop work meeting in Sydney. This letter said in part: "If agreement by all parties con cerned is reached that a strong stand must be taken by the ship owners . . . then a test of strength with the WWF will be made. "Meantime, the Principals in the UK and on the Continent (Hol land, Australia Lines included) have confirmed that the Lines' representatives in Australia should go ahead provided, of course, the Federal Government supports this action. "Talks are now going on with responsible Government officials hereon and should we obtain the backing from the Federal Gov ernment, then a test of strength will actually be made. "It Is essential that the Govern ment's backing should be firm. Such a firm attitude on the part' of the Government can only be prevailing if the Government knows before hand that they in turn have again the backing of the ACTU and the Australian Workers Union. "We feel sure that without guar antees of support from these powerful labor groups, the Fed eral Government will not give the OK to shipowner representa tives in Australia. "As you rightly indicated, it is therefore not purely a matter of shipowners versus WWF but of the Federal Government and shipowners against the WWF."
