 [?] . / Combined Movement Beat Shipowners And Menzies Govt. | By JIM STEVENS, Tribune's industrial Keporter A united labor movement defeated the attacks by the Menzies Government on waterside workers in 1954 and can do so again in 1965! Then and now fhe obiective was to smash the Waterside Work - ! ers' Federation . And it is for the same reasons that the Federation is being attacked today. |N November 1954 the then genera! secretary of the WWF (the late Jim Healy) said: "The Government's amendments to the Stevedor ing Industry Act are part of the shipowners campaign to divert public attention from their own criminally high freight charges and to smash the conditions which militant leadership of waterside work ers has won in recent years." The WWF and the ACTU at- that time had been demanding a full open inquiry into the causes of high freights. If the shipowners saw the need to silence the WWF then, how much more must they see the need today! Snice 1955 freight charges have risen . from £200 million to £507 million in 1964. During the same period the ton nage of cargo handled increased from 24 million to 35 million tons while the wages bill DROPPED from £22.2 million to £21.4 million. The wealthy overseas shipowners know they can rely on the Menzies Government for support and today this has become so obvious that the Government no longer tries to hide its stand.
