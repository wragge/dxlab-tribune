 WA secondary Industry nnnBflDBBHBBt f OSTS of meat have gone up due to cattle losses, there being a dire shortage of fodder brought about by the inclement weather. But it seems pouna wise ana oenny foolish that Mr. Court Minister for Industrial Develop ment in the W.A. Cabinet) could report that this year's 2,000 tons of Ord River seed cotton was due to be sold to Japan. Handling, bagging, cartage, wharf age, storage and loading costs will be £22 per ton and the net return will he £5 per ton. There is great financial loss each year through cattle dying from floods, fire and drought. It seems essential that we get fodder manufacturing plants. A plant to process high protein cotton cake would cost £250,000. The plant would supply more work, give us access to cheaper meat and dairy produce and more food for export. Further plant placed in Perth to process the cotton cake into balanced ration cubes could prove of untold value in emergencies. The cake coming down from the Ord and the haled hay and chaff up from the South would give us the components necessary. Other seed such as linseed could be grown up in the Ord River area and be treated in the same manner. So developing this industry further. Secondary industries are sorely need for Western Australian develop ment giving greater labour oppor- tunies and it would seem advan tageous that we should develop this industry to capacity.
