 SEEKS ACTION AGAINST WAR TOYS /CANBERRA: Government action to stop war toys flooding the shops before Christmas was sought by Mr. A. W. James, Labor NSW. He quoted a Sydney toy importer as having said that children seemed more and more to he playing blood thirsty games and with dolls of a "positively spine-chilling character." One doll gave the impression of having been brutally maimed, with eye-sockets showing where the eyes had been gouged out. Mr. James said war toys were already pouring into the Brisbane &lt;V- shopsâ€” commando time bombs, dag gers, guerilla guns, tommy-guns, machine-guns, hand grenades and machetes. He said "The minds of children must not be poisoned merely to help the toy manufacturers make a profit." ,v". -
