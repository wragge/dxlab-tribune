 MENZIES HITS WORKERS, . NOT PROFITEERS CANBERRA: Rising costs of living in HSW were associated! witli rising company profits ; â€” and the Federal Government did nothing about it. ! kAK. E. W. PETERS, Labor, ! Victoria said this in | parliament last Thursday. ! "I was horrified to read in the Sydney newspapers today that the cost of living in Sydney rose by 14/- a week in the 15 weeks ended on June 30, and that the increase in all other capital cities was greater" he said. "The cost of living is increasing more rapidly than last year because of the effects of the Budget. The onslaught on the conditions of the average person and the pensioner has been savage. "In the same newspapers I learn that the profits of 11 companies picked at random were 25 per cent, 11, 39, 43, 7, 18, 28, 44, 20 and 19 per cent. Profits were as high as almost 45 per cent and the average was more than 25 per cent." The Federal Government, however, did not take emergency action such as it was taking against the water side workers "in the interests of the shipping combines that have exploited Australia to the tune of hundreds of millions of pounds dur ing the last 10 years," and whose freight charges had increased by about 25 per cent or more over the past few years. Public anger is rising over the widespread marketing of "save money specials" in mass consumer lines. Recently, Tribune purchased the two packets of Persil (top of picture) from the same Woolworths store at Town Hall, Sydney. They both cost 3/3$ and both have a net weight of 26 ounces, but one is "4d. off" and the other "7d. off". At the Market Street branch similar packets cost 3/5 and at Wynyard, you could only "save" 4d. on the same sized packets, costing 3/6$. The centre Rinso packet containing 27 ounces (4d. off) and the one on on the right, containing 24 ounces (7d. off) were both purchased on March 20 and cost 3/5$ each. A few months earlier the same store sold the packet on left containing 30 ounces (save 4d.) for 3/4$.
