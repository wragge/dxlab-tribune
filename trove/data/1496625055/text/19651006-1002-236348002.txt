 [?] With Tribune's Industrial Roundsman THE employers' Metal Trades Association now wants to discourage formation of shop committees in their plants. We are told by the director, Mr. Fry, that "employers can best serve their own long term interests by bearing in mind that shop com mittees are not an integral part of the trade union organisation." This is how the employers In terpret ACTU policy on shop com mittees.. The workers on the other hand lenow that where strong committees have been established, over award payments up to £5 a week have been won. Why wouldn't the employers want to "discourage" these committees! The struggle for these over-award payments has now also become ACTU policy since the workers received their raw deal from the Arbitration Commission. And how are workers to carry out ACTU policy without strong job organisation? ? About 300 employees of Burns Philp (New Guinea) Ltd., at Port Moresby, downed tools last Monday for higher pay, better accommoda tion and improved working condi tions. They receive between £3 and £6 a week and most are on £3/5/-. Last year the above company made the biggest profit in its history and made an issue of bonus shares to the tune of £1.8 million.
