 BAKE YOUR OWN COOKIES gYDNEY: Members of the New South Wales Upper House learnt last week that biscuits are a luxury. A Labor Memoer, Mr. d. A. Weir, asked the Leader of the Government, Mr. A. D. Bridges whether that in view of the recent increases in many grocery lines the Askin Goverment would approach the Federal Government to lift sales tax on essential items. In reply Mr. Bridges said: "I am not aware that sales tax is payable on the items to which he has re ferred. "I am aware of course, that sales tax is payable on a large range of luxury goods, but is not payable on normal consumer items." Mr. J. J. Maloney: "Sales tax is payable on biscuits." Mr. Bridges: "I excepted luxury items and I have yet to learn that biscuits are an essential consumer item." Mir. Maloney: "Surely they are nob clasesed as luxuries." Mr. Bridges: "Possibily the terra 'luxury items' might have been mis applied when referring to biscuits, but the average wage earner seeking to buy essential goods will vary largely use flour and other ingredi ents that are free from sales tax, for the purpose of making biscuits. "Wlien I was in a position where every penny countedâ€” and every penny still counts, I was not able to buy biscuits, which apparently the Hon. J. J. Maloney would buy without the slightest hesitation." On his appointmeint Mr. A. D, Bridges announced that he would resign his directorship in over 60 firms.
