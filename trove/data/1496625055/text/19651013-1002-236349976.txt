 "fsjwswpsw;" Robbie Burns — a very suspicious character THE report that the Menzies Government is drafting a "White Paper on Commun ism" as demanded by the K.b.L. ana orner rignr-wmg ex tremists, recalls the recent published statements by R.S.L. State Councillor A. Porter: "Communsts should be put be- ...bind barbed wire or given a one way ticket out of Australia . . . drive them underground— about six feet under." That is a fair indication of the sort of thinking and the real aims of those sponsoring this dangerous, anti-democratic White Paper plan. I have a strong regard for all mankind. I can extend tolerance to those who would deny it to me and to those who violently disagree with me when I merely seek an indepen dent viewpoint. I am opposed to war prepartions; I oppose wars before the first sol dier dies and from then on. I oppose concentration camps, barbed wire or not. Robbie Burns who had something to say about "Man's inhumanity to man", if he were with us today, would certainly come under close scrutiny from Menzies' security police, assisted by the R.S.L. brass- hats, Santamaria of the National Civic Council, the D.L.P. and a few right-wing trade union officials who, in. the past, have taken sides with big foreign monopolies against their own members. They would all see sedition in Burns' poems. Ron Mackerras, Sydney (N.S.W.).
