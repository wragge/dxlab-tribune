 Warning on Royal Commission into land valuations A WARNING that the pre sent Royal Commission into land valuations and local gov ernment financing might fav- or big business interests was issued by the recent annual conference of the New South Wales Federation of Progress Associations. Such decisions by the Commis- Islon could leave the small property owners carrying the heavy burdens of rates now causing concern, al though relief of these burdens was supposed to be one of the aims of the Commission. The conference instructed the ex ecutive to prepare a case for sub mission to the Commission. It was also directed to protest to the Askin State Government against its proposals to alter the local gov ernment electoral system. Delegates from the Sydney metro politan area, and from the Northern and Southern Regional Councils and individual assn's attended the con ference. The Conference adopted the re port of the President Mr. S. Wade in which the local Government As sociation was criticised for having called off its campaign to arouse public opinion in support of its de mand for 5% of national revenue for local government needs. Many Councils had subscribed to this campaign. The conference expressed dissatis faction with the reductions in the Loan allocations by the State Gov ernment) to Council's without com pensatory aid from the Federal Government. Emphasis was placed on the need for supplementary finance in the form of finance grants from the national revenue for local govern ment, as the main factor in bring ing relief for local government bod ies and to relieve ratepayers' bur dens. The Executive was instructed to give special attention to organising a regional council of Progress As sociations in the Sydney Metro- | politan area.
