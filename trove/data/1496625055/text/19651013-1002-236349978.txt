 Aden and the consequences HfWIWIMWII !! ill IWIWII II II II I jPHE critical situation in Aden is shaking the British Govern ment and the consequences will be very grave unless the British get out of the country soon. Following the dismissal of the Chief Minister Mr. Mackawee, the suspension of the Constitution, a state of emergency was imposed on the people. All this has brought about a de terioration in the economy. But the people of Aden are unit ing. The Waterside Workers (WWA) had a go-slow when the Colonial Secretariat of the Port refused to negotiate with them for improved conditions. Also, the Petroleum Workers' Union pleged full support to the waterside workers. On the eve of suspension of the Constitution the Unions were making efforts to unite all workers to gain indepenendence. In August last a conference was held which issued a statement em phasising their struggle against exploitatinon and expressing sup port for the waterside workers. This bold stand by the Aden workers paved the way for a united front with the National Liberation Front of Arabia and the demand for independence anl re moval of the British military base in Aden was strengthened.
