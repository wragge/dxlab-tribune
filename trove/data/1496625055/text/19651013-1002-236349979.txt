 Wharfies right â€” yet penalised ! ANBERRA: Examples of how the waterside work ers are always penalised for stoppages even when others are responsible were given to Parliament last week by Mr. B. P. Hansen, Labor, Queens land. He cited the case of the Fast Wind in Townsville which, like many ships running under cheap register, had badly rigged derricks, loose and rusted guys, said Mr. Hansen. After four hours of argument the faulty guys were replaced and the loading began. "Although the owners were clearly in the wrong the WWF members and not the owners were penalised" said Mr. Hansen. "Only last week the WWF mem bers were ordered to load drums of soda weighing 7501bs. with no mechanical assistance. "After two hours arguing they were given the necessary equip ment, but not before the gang had been suspended and its members had lost their privileges as usual. It was clearly the owners' fault but they were again not penalised. "The same week the meat-packing company broke its agreement on the use of certain labor in the wharf cold stores. After investigations the WWF members were again proven right and the company wrong. But who suffered ? Not the company . . ."
