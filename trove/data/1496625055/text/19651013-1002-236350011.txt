 Housewives sign against high prices SYDNEY: The Askin State Government policy of en couraging price rises and then blaming the drought, is in trouble with the house wives. Over the past week, 2,000 Sydney housewives signed a petition de manding that the Government take action in prices, using the Prices Regulation Act (1948-49) and also conduct an immediate inquiry into rising prices. The petition was sent out by the Union of Australian \ omen to a few of their members to test out the housewives' reactions. A young married woman, Mrs. Flo McGlynn, canvassed eight streets in Dundas Valley and ob tained 180 signatures. She told Tribune that the general reaction was "I'll sign, who wouldn't?". One woman, pushing two kiddies in a pram as she signed, said: "I hope you can do something because I have seven children." When it was known what the peti tion was about Mrs. 'McGlynn was invited into homes, offered cups of tea, and even provided with a cut lunch to uelp her on her way. She gathered her signatures over three days. It took so long because half of the women were at work. Most women she approached felt that two wages were necessary to feed and bring up a family on today's prices. "If the UAW hadn't sent me some petitions I would have got my own out." "Over ..the past few . weeks, as I could see price: rising higher and higher, I began to get madder and madder!" The Askin Government, and espe-" cially the Minister responsible for prices (Mr. E. Willis), are under" continuous fire in Parliament by the Opposition over their prices policy. MRS. FLO McGLYNN . . . If the UAW hadn't sent me petitions I would have got my own out!"
