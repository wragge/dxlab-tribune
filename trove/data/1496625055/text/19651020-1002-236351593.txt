 [?] i They're in the | | Big Fight I II ; ' By THE CHALLENGER ' I : b v I Aborigine ex-boxer Herbert John Murray, | better known to the old-time fight fraternity as I | "Doolan", was one of 150 people who helped to jllj | make last weekend's Aborigine Conference in | ' Sydney a big success. Ill jjjj. ALTHOUGH at 69. years II of age, Doolan can be j|jj said to be in: the twilight X of his fighting career, his II contributions these days to l.J the fight for Civic Rights III and Equality for Abori- jjf gines will long be re mem - 1111 bered by the more useful III people of society long aftr his boxing record is but.-" II an entry in the record X book.. IIH II Doolan was born at Brungle rill in 1896 and reared around Cvwra !'' (Erambie Mission). II'. He now receives the pension; but during his working days; as hi he nonchalantly puts it, he has HI "done all the hard jobs — hay- si making, wheat-lumping, pick- Mi and-shovel work". Ill Jimmy Sharman's boxing tent was the first fight venue for HI Doolan, when - he was about 16 ".' years of age. He spent a short time with it, before taking the game on. seriously about three ;. years later. ill During his career, Doolan lost III a close points decision over, twenty rounds to Earl Baxter -in HI an elimination contest for a shot llll at the Australian lightweight K title held by Billy Grimes. He also has the distinction of ... beating Charlie Moy, who heat m the famous Jimeto. (Jimeto was II a bull-necked world-rated fight- v er from the Philippines, who jjij toured this country, knocking HI nearly everybody over). V. Reminising on the past Dool- III an said: III "i. was at the Burns— John- son world heavyweight title fight and think that Johnson would , probably be about the greatest boxer all-time I've. seen. if I Amongst the Aborigine boys, '(' 1 I think Ron Richards was the 1 best. He could have won the .1 world title. Also Dave Sands mj was unlucky not to get a shot at the world title, I think he could v ; have won it . . . Elley Bennet? fjj I think he was one of the best ||| pound for pound punchers in the i : world, at his time." ii« i Doolan's contribution to the '» fight game after he retired was to help put a couple of lads on |||| \ the road to success. One of them, j||| j I Roy Treasure, fought at Sydney llll 1 ' Stadium. The other was Nipper X I &lt; O'Brien. || Asked if he thought boxing was 1,1 harmful, Doolan replied: "No. mi Just like anything else, drinking or smoking— I do neither— it v must be done in moderation. iii "J got out before it did me |||| any harm." v - This last statement leaves |||| Doolan to a small degree disap- '' pointed, for he often wished in the past to he able to display the distinctive mark of his past pro- i. fession— a thick ear. jjjj "I used to poke it out at them 1 trying to get one", he said with a X smile. m Also at the Conference was III Australia's first full time Abori- X gine boxing trainer, Roy Carroll, ||| who has been training boxers for IJ'J the past six years. Roy is an ex-boxer who did B most of his fighting in the coun- ' m try. Like Doolan, Roy hails :,, a from Cowra. ||| 1 . Fighting as a middleweigth, he ... 1 won the first 12 of his fights, 11 mi 1 by. KO, and was never stopped || I ; in a fight .except through cut v 1 eyes' 1|| I
