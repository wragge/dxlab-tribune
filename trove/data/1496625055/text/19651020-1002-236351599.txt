 A welcome fact "J"HE signing of an Australian-Soviet trade agreement i announced last Saturday will be welcomed by all friends | of better relations between the two countries. Acting Trade Minister Hasluck commented that "by concluding this simple agreement, which provides for the exchange of most-favored nation treatment, we have for malised our existing practice". Both countries, he said, "now have the asurance of an agreement against any discrimination in our trade rela tions". The nature and scope of- Australian-Soviet trade could be "reviewed as necessary as trade develops". Australians will hope that it develops fast and will not be hampered by the sort of childish restriction which recently prevented the USSR establishing a commercial representative's office in Sydney, and the issue of visas to a Soviet trade union delegation.
