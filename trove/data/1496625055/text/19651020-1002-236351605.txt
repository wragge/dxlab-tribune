 [?] With Tribune's Industrial Roundsman JUST how do you fix the wages of Arbitration Court Judges? Higher productiv ity wouldn't come into it! Tlif>v'il have a case with Drice Increases, but they themselves ruled that increased prices should not be considered. It must he based on the capacity to pay. The workers have been paying dearly as the recent basic wage decision proves! ? DR1NCE Charlie won't learnt much about the ral Australians whilst improving his education here next year. Just imagine the bad habits he might learn; and what would MUM say when he returned home: "Oh, Charlie! You haven't been drinking beer again! Be a good boy and have a cherry brandy." ? A Melbourne Chartered Accountant (Mr. R. Parry) disagrees with the Decimal Currency Board that the dual currency (for 18 months or more) "will not create much diffi culty." Mr. Parry said the prospect of dual currency dealing was regarded by the banks as too complex for bank tellers and accordingly have insisted on a simultaneous changeover date throughout Australia. Imagine,- he said, receiving one $10, four Â£1 and two S2 notes in exchange for a $22 cheque! The $10 note will be blue in color and will still be called a "fiver" by many shopkeepers, but some wil call it "ten." Bank tellers are afraid they will give four "fivers" in exchange for a $20 cheque. With bank tellers anticipating mis takes, how are workers and house wives expected to cope with the situations? He said a lengthy dual currency period wasn't essential for the banks so why should it be necessary for th&lt; rest of Australia?
