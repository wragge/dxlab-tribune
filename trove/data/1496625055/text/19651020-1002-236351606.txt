The Prime Minister, in Federal |||| I Parliament on October 14, said: ml III "The Board has neither re- K ' quested wholesalers or retailers |||| to increase prices of certain "J commodities nor has it made III any request to the rounding of HI Â£ s. d. prices to amounts which ... v will be exactly convertible to n jij decimal currency." |||| II But Mr. J. David, general M manager of Davids Pty. Ltd. |||| (sponsoring Foodlands), inter- |"J viewed in "Retail Week" (Octo- j|j ber 15) about recent price in creases, said: v "This price adjusiment is in mj jij line with a request from the |||| HI Decimal Currency Board to make any price variations now iiij I rather than February." ||||
