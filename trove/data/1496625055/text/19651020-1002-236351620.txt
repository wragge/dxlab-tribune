 Protest meeting over high prices SYDNEY : A public protest meeting in the Sydney Town Hall and a Statewide petition are included in a campaign being developed by NSW trade unions against price increases. "HIS campaign is part of the Council's two-sided policy for higher living standards — supporting the wages program of the Aus tralian Council of Trade Unions; and organising max imum opposition to price increases. The Labor Council's campaign committee decided on a petition that will ask the N.S.W. Government to take urgent action to control and reduce prices as a means of protect- ing the living standards of N.S.W. citizens. In order to protect living standards the Government .will be asked to: — Use the price fixing machinery already available to peg prices at pre sent levels and institute appropriate public inquiries into food prices with the aim of bringing about reductions in prices. Initiate a conference of Pre miers of each State together with Commonwealth Governmet represen tatives for the purpose of arriving at agreement for implementing a national prices control and reduction policy.
