 The day they slowed the line at GMH MELBOURNE: Workers claim that last week's tour of inspection of General Motors plants by the Arbitration Com mission was stage-managed and faked by the compay. The tour was part of the current hearing of the claim for a £3 a week wage rise. Workers told the Guardian that during the visit the production lines were slowed down by 15 to 20 per cent. At the Dandenong plant the slow ing down of the line lasted from 3 p.m. on Thursday till the same time the next day. On Wednesday a remarkable event occurred in Plant No. 1 at Fisher men's Bend when the section ran out of materials half an hour before the judges were due to arrive. The work ers were told to just potter about doing odd jobs. But evidently someone changed his mind— the touring party didn't turn up at their section! Workers say that the judges were j accompanied by such a retinue of company executives that it looked like a Royal Tour. In the Commission last week union advocate Mr. R. Hawke stated that ! movements and levels of production, productivity and profits of G.M.H. have created not only a capacity but an obligation to pay higher rates. Mr. Hawke quoted statements by the management to the effect that the company's success had been due to the "efforts of the employees work ing as a team". General Motors-Holden's Ltd. made a profit last year of £18.5 million, despite the prolonged strike of last . October. Increasing unrest has been reported In other sections of the car industry at the employers' stop-go policies in production. Plants work at great speed for part of the year, then re ward workers for their efforts by mass sackings when stocks of unsold cars build up. Union officials say that during "slack" periods the fear of dismissal is used by employers to step up pro duction per man.
