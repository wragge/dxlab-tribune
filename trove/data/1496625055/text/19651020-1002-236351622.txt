 Our rich "Uncle" By JUNE MILLS KIO longer is there any mys tery about Tribune Fund's very good friend, D.R.A.Y. As far back as March last year a wrote in tms column now we n heard on the grapevine that some Sydney readers did not believe he existed; hut not only does he exist (at that time donating under the initials Y.A.R.D.), but we'd met him and shaken his hand. Others also did not believe these donations were real and suggestions to this effect were made in the Sydney Morning Herald. Now the Herald has published a letter from Tribune and an interview with our good friend. (See story this page.) We need more friends like D.R.A.Y. This week a donor of £2, "OV," sent with his donation some very interesting proposals for electioneer ing. These proposals have been handed to the Communist Party's Sydney District Committee.
