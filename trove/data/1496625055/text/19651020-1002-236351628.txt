 Conscripts overseas in 1966 ? ANBERKA: "The first National Servicemen will depart for overseas service some time during 1966," according to "Inside Can- berra," published by Mr. Don Whitington. The First Battalion R.A. Regiment now serving in Vietnam is due to be relieved about the middle of next year. The normal policy is for overseas units to be replaced after 12 months if troops are not accompanied by .heir families, as is the case in Vietnam. By June next year the Army will have at least seven full infantry oattaliuns. All except the 4th Bat- ralion in Malaysia and the Vietnam battalion will include a significant number of National Servicemen. Approximately 800 conscripts from the first call-up were posted to the 2nd, 5th and 6th Infantry Bat talions last month, and one of these battalions will replace the troops in Vietnam.
