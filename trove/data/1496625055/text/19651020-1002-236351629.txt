AS Tribune went to press, the Minister for Transport (Mr. Morris) had failed to answer the unions' deadline and reply to the workers' wage demands, i i Already two 24 hour stoppages have been held in support of wage claims which were first put to the Government last December. The 26 unions are demanding an increment scheme of 16/6 after the first year, 33/- after two years service and 49/6 after the third and that pay ments be based only on service not skill or classification. An earlier meeting of the unions had rejected the last offer from the Gov ernment to give increases from 10/- to 17/6 a week. The Labor Council's negotiating commitee last met the Minister on September 9 when he promised to reply within two weeks. A meeting of the 26 unions cover ing rail and bus workers last Monday gave the Minister until Tuesday to make a "satisfactory" reply to the wage demands. Woiiino- this ft further 24 hour stop- page from midnight Monday would be held. Mr. R. Marsh (acting secretary of the NSW Labor Council) said the un ions were worried about the repeated delays fcy the Government in replying to the negotiating committee ;l IE
