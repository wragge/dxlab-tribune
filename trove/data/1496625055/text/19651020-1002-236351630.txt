 [?] SYDNEY: Three hun dred trainee teachers de monstrated outside NSW Parliament last Wednesday tor the second time within a week. While small groups lobbied their members of Parliament, the rest chanted "We need more pay", ""More" pay for teacher trainees". A spokesman said that they were demonstrating against the broken promises of the Askin government. Before the elections they had been promised large increases in their scholarship allowances to bring them up to Victorian trainee teachers rates. Instead most trainee teachers received only an increase of 7/8 a week. When this is added to their previous allowance of £4/8/- it comes to only £5/5/8 a week, which is hardly enough to live on. NSW trainee teachers are the lowest paid in the Common wealth. Victorian teacher trainees start off with about £10 a week, which is more than double the present rate for most NSW train ees. The NSW trainees were also demonstrating because even the small increases granted by the Askin Government wouldn't come into effect until next year. It's no wonder that the ban ners carried by the demonstra tors attacked the Askin adminis tration as being unfair and hypo critical to teacher trainees.
