 The Great Wage Robbery" The recent new Pastoral Award has been described by Australian Workers' Union members as "the biggest 'steal' since the London Train Robbery". The newspaper "The Voice" (organ of the Council for Mem- I bership Control of AWU) said the failure of the federal sec retary, Mr. Doughterty, to secure the balance of the 28 per cent increase in margins, won by the ACTU in 1959 will cost shearer: alone another £209,000 a year. The paper said that since 1959 | the total retrospective loss for E shearers is about £3 million. I The award again gives employ I ers the right to confiscate one I week's wages from any pastoral i worker who leaves the shed be- 1 fore the end of his agreement. I Hundreds of thousands of pounds had been taken from militant pastoral workers who left sheds in protest against bad accommodation, bad machinery, and failure to compensate for ex cessive use of tools. When workers requested Head Office for action they were told that employers were acting with in their legal rights and nothing could be done about it. "The Voice" said NSW sec retary, Mr. C. Oliver, last yeai successfully challenged this con cept and the Commonwealth In dustrial Court said the employei was liable to pay an employee his earnings even if he had left the shed in breach of the award Commenting on the £3 millior loss in margins, the paper saio many members in the pastora industry believe that had thr AWU actively supported tht ACTU in. the struggles leading iq; to the P Tetal Trades Margins increases in 1959 and again ir 1963 the union would have beer aranted the full 28 per cent in urease plus the in rent j> ! ;n lflfi.3.
