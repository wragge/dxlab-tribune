 Danger in Indenesla gYDNEY: "An army dictatorship in Indonesia would be an obstacle the development of friencVy rela tions between Australia and Indo- nesia," said Mr. L. Aarons, general secretary of the Communist Party of Australia, last weekend in Sydney. Speaking to the party's central committee, he said that Australian security and peace depended very much on the development of such friendship . Whatever the actual course of events in Indonesia,- there 1 was no doubt that the Army rightist leaders were seeking military dictatorship and striving . to destroy the Commu nist Party of Indonesia through a bloody massacre! At the same time there was no mass anti-Communist movement. "We have always supported the patriotic struggles of the Indonesian Communists and sought to maintain relations, and have always opposed the anti-Indonesain campaign of rightist forces in Australia. This we will continue. "We are confident that the PKI will be able to continue its struggle, overcome the difficulties it faces from internal and external forces of the extreme Right and' defeat the present attacks," he said. . The central committee decided to send a message of warm fraternal greetings and solidarity to the central committee of the Communist Party of Indonesia.
