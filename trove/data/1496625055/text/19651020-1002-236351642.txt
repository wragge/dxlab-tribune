 The Rights of Spring THE Waratah Spring Festival of 1965 was given a blimpish note by the pageantry and uni- forms of Naw Week. Even conceding that defence is fundamental, Spring is a time when we might see more of the creative efforts of the citizens rather than be reminded again, as we invari ably are these days, that the Ameri cans have got another war on. Organisers of the Art displays threw their nets wide and caught some interesting specimens. Sydney's citizens were fully en grossed by the ways some of their artists depicted the visible and invisible scene. Others made light of it all. The poets fared rather better. Their second night's reading went off with a bang as some visiting oellringers were having a practice in the Cathedral. Whenever - the oell-ringers paused for breath, the ooets' voices could be heard soar- ng out and around the park. Many eople stayed to listen. But the highlight of the Festival /as the big march and pageant that ,ave the citizens a lift they well ieserve every month of the year. ,Vho knows next year's Festival night bring forth a Van Gogh (if le doesn't pass unnoticed) and the uns and drums might be tuned own. just for that one week D.K.. Sydney (NSW).
