 "pe Paul's plea Respite p0pC Paul's piea fo: Peace, and the protes the 4mo "Sands of Iearnei men. aW inf riC&lt;tns continue tO pom t the dirty fight in Viet- nam. We want no more agony - . caused by war. Hiroshima meant horror for half a million people. With the further escalation of war by the Pentagon— the lunatics who may press the wrong button- mankind lives in fear for the future. "Lay down your arms," said the Pope. Yes, and shake hands, in stead of your fists. No greater insult could have been given to such a noble character as the Pope when the USA, a few days later, bombed North Vietnam and also sent many more troops into the South to murder innocent people. The mothers of the boys now in Vietnam were given no choice, unlike Mr. Menzies in World War I. I often hear the crying of a mother who says: "I have loved my son for many years , And now he is taken away, All I shed is bitter tears. Because I had no say." One must not remain silent in this question of murderous aggression by the USA. They are trying to do what Hitler failed to do. We ask — Give us peace and goodwill towards all men.
