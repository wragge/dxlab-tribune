 Read these i- Mill HI books! ¥ WOULD strongly urge you to review two books that recently appeared in London — "Verdun" by Georges Blond, published by Andre Deutsch, London and the "Gallipoli Story" by Robert Rhodes James. "Gallipoli Story" was serialised jy The Australian but it is perhaps latural that the most interesting portions were not included. Much material never published .nywhere is included in this book. In April, 1941, an attempt was nade to use the Australian 8th Division to break a strike by planta- ion workers in Malaya. Much to the credit of the late 'eneral Bennett he blocked that love by the English Command. Parts like that were, of course, leleted from the Australia's account )f the Gordon Bennett story by 7ronlrfl T.PWA A. J. Price, Brisbane (Q.,).
