 Who owns the petrol J'm just an ordinary bloke â€” work, like a drink, read Tribune and watch the Mavis Brampston show. I also own a car and use pet rol, any brand so long as it goes. Now the man on TV assures me ana all who watch, I should use Ampol because it is 100 per cent Australian owned and I would be helping Australia. I am Australian, like Australia and like to help people. Another announcer makes the same claim for B.P. Now, could you inform me, (and I am sure yours is the only paper that would), just how these claims line up with facts and should I change from the brand I now use (incidentally because it is sold at the nearest garage) and do my littile bit as a true patriot? G- McDonald, Berala. Answer: Shares in Ampol are Australian owned. British Petrol eum is British owned. It wr8 formerly Anglo-Irianian Oil Co.; Menzies sold out the Common wealth Government's half share in the Commonwealth Oil Refin ery to BP.
