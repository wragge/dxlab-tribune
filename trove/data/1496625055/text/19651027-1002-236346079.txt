 Mrs Mr-Pllips Di i with regret that Tribune re cords the death of Anne McPhillips recently. Mrs. IcF JI!ips was an organiser of the Hotel, Club & Restaurant Employees Union until in 1952 she did not stand for re-election and returned to work in the industry. She was a member of the Commun ist Party for many years. Tribune expends deepest sym pathy to her relatives.
