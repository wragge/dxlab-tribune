The overall expenditure on publicity and staging the Fair is over £3 million. Dozens of Australian companies are exhibiting goods for export at the Fair. Sponsors of the Fair are the Sydney Chamber of Com merce, the Chamber of Manu facturers of NSW and the - Retail Traders of New South Wales. It is supported by a num ber of committees represent ing air, rail, sea, tourist and accommodation interests. Today the threat of nu clear yvar gives to interna tional trade fairs a greater role than ever before — as an aid to breaking down bar- ' riers of ignorance and dis trust through peaceful trad ing contacts and exchanges.
