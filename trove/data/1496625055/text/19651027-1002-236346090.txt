"pOR the first weeks of I cane-cutting", said Ri- | gob-eft©' Cue!©;, "my hands | were cowered1 in blood " 1 But he kept on and won I recognition as a vanguard I cutter. I This was all the more merito- | rious, because 25-year-old Rigob- Ierto is not a cane-cutter at all, hut a waiter in. a: hotel cafeteria. I He is- one of the thousands I f from all callings who have gone ; I into seasonal cane-cutting, one I I of the world's toughtest jobs, I as a volunteer to help1 harvest j i Cuba's record crops, j f Rigoberto works at the plush ; I Habana Riviera hotel, one of the 1 1 hotels which U.S. interests built I for the jet set, but . which the I Cuban Government now runs | for a very different type of I visitor." | The hotel has a staff of 500, I and last season 423. of them took | part in voluntary sugar-harvest I work; some for a couple of j: weeks, some (like Rigoberto) j for as long as five months. | Women as well as men helped ! on various jobs in the harvest. l wmie iney are wonting m uie | sugar, their wages are provided by extra work by those still at . | their normal, place of employ- | ment. I As well as wages, they got their j full proportion of tips, which the | hotel workers pool. | Rigoberto and the others say I they go cane-cutting not because j it is pleasant, but because they I know it is something they can I do to help their country and its- I socialist revolution. I Every stick of cane- they cut | is to help Cuba's economy, in | which sugar counts for so much; j Every blow of their machete | in the canefields is a blow | against the United States' block- ade of sugar imports from Cuba, aimed at strangling. - this young Republic which had dared to as- . sert its freedom a mere 90. miles j from U.S.A. | We heard Rigoberto's story, | and the stories of others, in an | animated- interview with cafeta- | ria workers ' at the hotel during I one of their breaks -from work, I The interview started with I seven of. them, the two oi us and i Jorge Reece Howard as interpre- ! ter. I I BUS,, as the interview got live- I lier (sometimes we were inter- i viewing tftenr, at; other times they 1 were interviewing us), the num- ! ! ber in the group kept increas- | j ... ing. . | , At one time,- it was" 14- and i » ' still growing. ! On.- cane-cutting, they gave the f floor to Rigoberto. He has gone ! cutting now for' three seasons. I In three of the months of the I last season, his brigade of 28 ! cutter?,, all voluntary workers, I cut 1.3 million arrobas (about I5G6f tons; an arroab is 25 lbs.) ! — and in poor cane and not I burnt. | The brigade aims to reach j 20,000 tons in this coming season, | and ' Rigoberto has set himself j ' a personal target of 1,000 tons. J How are conditions for the I cane-cutters? . j 1 . Not bad for those who are S used to country life, but hard j for those whose lives have been 5 spent in. Havana, said Rigoberto | with some feeling. | 1 As cutters, they live in bar- j lawno, X UVW picu WI U4— UCCl, © eggs, fish, rice and so on (."but I j have a specially big appetitie; j I ate for seven," said Riboberto). g Was the food well prepared and | well cooked? f Yes, of course — "because our f cooks there are the same ones as (| we have here in the hotel." jj At that point, someone in the | group beckoned over one of the | cooks, 45-year-old Antonio Cur- | rabas, a- small but lively charac- ! ter, who last season spent five | months cooking -for cutters. j He is a member of the United j Party of the Socialist Revolu- I tion. | Another in the group who has S been cane-cutting was Roberto j Naldes. He is a. militiaman. S In the Playa Giron battle (when > U.S.-orgarrised and U.S.-trained | Cuban counter-revolutionaries | and mercenaries launched their | invasion attempt), Roberto was | an anti-aircraft gunner on a « Cuban warship which engaged g B26 planes. g Two of the crew of his gun j were killed, but they took toll v ( of the B26's. S | We tried at times to bring the J I talk around -to -their work in the j ! hotel. | I But it kept reverting to sugar j I as Rigoberto- m particular told of j | the plans for Cuban sugar and | | wanted to know a lot of things | I about Australian sugar. j j He told of the plan to lift j | Cuban sugar production to ten I | millions tons in the next few g I years. S He spoke of mechanisation dif- I I ficulties, but said: "W7e will reach , j the Iff million tons, with or with- 5 | out machines." = As for their work-in the hotel, j i "before the Revolution, when the j S North Americans owned the j I hotel, those who came here g I treated us as inferiors.' f I Now those who come here are j I workers. j | "We serve them gladly, and we , | know that, perhaps tomorrow, I J they will be working- to help j f us." j i | i i.. n .in ii —
