 Solidarity defeats victimisation PERTH: Solidarity of Midland workshops men in standing by their mates in a blatant victimisation case should make the management think twice about su:h actions in future. After winning a punishment appeal against a Â£2 tme tor having allegedly sworn at a sub-foreman, the worker, Mr. L. Bowley, was transferred to a different job. When the management would not see a deputation from the men, on Thursday, October 22, more than 2,000 men downed tools. A seven-man dep utation - then went to -Parliament, House, to see Railways Minister Court or Transport Minister O'Connor. > The management's refusal to see the -deputation brought to a head the anger of the men after a long cam paign of pin-pricking by the manage ment, who had refused to cooperate with the job committee. The men's firm action resulted in a compulsory conference being called by Arbitration Commissioner Kelly last Friday, with the proviso that a further conference be called- if a . satisfactory settlement was not reached.
