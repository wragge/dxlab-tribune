 [?] ! Short Of Breath | The '"Little Olympics" held in Mexico City this month j ! should have provided a number of answer? to the high- j I altitude controversy surrounding the 1968 Olympics to be j j held there- j One of the main points clari- g | fied by the games was that g J competitors in long distance 1 ! events will most certainly be j ! affected by the rarified air. j If countries with competitors g in the 1968 Olympics want to | I do themselves justice , they will j I have to provide their athletes j I with a suitable "high altitude" g g conditioning program some time ! ! before the Olympics take place, g ! That a . lack of altitude condi- j I tioning . is distastrous can be g seen from world record holder ? j Hop Clark's racing failure four i I. days before he raced. . J j j Clarke was beaten in the j g 5,000 metres . by the Tunisian S Gamoudj,, who had spent 15 ! j days preceding the Little Olym- , g pics at . the French training | j camp in the Pyrenees. j j Even so, Gamoudi's time was j | almost a minute slower than his f | usual time over, the distance. | ! Also, Gamoucli's time in win- j | ning the 10,000 metres was j j nearly three minutes longer than g | his silver medal winning time j I at the Tokyo Olympics. g | In the swimming events at j I the Little Olympics, it was the | I acclimatised competitors who g | were able to take out the top I honors. j s The Russians, reported tram- I j ing at : high altitudes in the j g Caucasus were successful, and j g apparently less affected by the | thin air -of Mexico City. j g They and the Mexican cham- g ! pion Echevarra were able to j I record world class times. | g These and the French demon- j j strated that the athlete trained , I in the conditions of high altitude | I have a distinct advantage. j j. ..If Australia is to be up with j 1 the winners when the 1968 Olym- , pics take place, it would be wise | | for', the Australian Olympic Com- j j ' mittee to give serious thought g I now to the setting up of a suit- j | able training camp. I g It can be assumed that Ron j S Clarke,, who acted as a guinea | j pig for a French medical team | I during the Little Olympics would j g be able to help with details oi j ! his experiences.'
