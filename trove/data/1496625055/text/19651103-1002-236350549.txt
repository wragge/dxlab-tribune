 I G.M.H. ff€t fligl ! ® j needle front f Stateside f ' | MELBOURNE: General Motors-Holden work- a | ers would need a wage increase of £17/6/. a I | week, nearly six times the amount they are re- ! questing, to bridge the gap between wage f j productivity gains since 1952. | I "THIS is one of the facts I presented to the Arbi- | tration Commission by vis- 1 iting official of the United | States Union of Auto N i Workers, Mr. Ellsworth | ("Pat") Patterson — to j the amazement of workers S and the consternation of I GM bosses, j He also told the Court:— | Productivity of GMH was j put at 5.1 per cent gain a year S since 1950 — almost double the I estimated rate for Australia as I a whole. ! In the same period GMH j workers have only had a 1.6 to a 1.9 increase in real wages, 8 annually. I "Had real wages increased as | fast as productivity during the j period of 1963 through 1964, I GMH workers should have re- l ceived an average of £36 a week | for their labor in 1964," he said. | GMH profits moved up to 624 per cent and wages 130 per f cent, between 1950 and 1964. | © An investment of £2969 in General Motors stock at the be- S ginning of 1953 would have earn- | ed for the investor as much as Ia GMH worker received for 12 years of unremitting labor. © G.M. board chairman Fred- | eric G. Donner in 1963 received I in salaries and bonuses the sum S of 404 dollars an hour. A typical I employee of the firm would have I to work for 112 years to get | Donner's annual salary. j" 8 Mr. Patterson's right to ap- ! ) pear was strongly challenged | !by the company's advocate Mr. | J. Robinson, who ' argued that | I the General "Motors Corpora- | | tion, the U.S. parent firm, was j | not involved in the case. j After hours of argument, the 8 I advocate finally managed to g S have his appearance postponed I I for a fortnight. g ! Then a three-hour argument ! raged over the question of whe- j ther remuneration of execu- j 1 tives and stockholders should be I admitted as evidence. I | Several days of cross-examina- | | tion failed to shake Mr. Patter- j 8 son's contention that GMH could 8 | substantially reduce the price of j its products give its workers the | I £3 rise sought, and still have | a substantial return to inves- i DOTS i Alter an opening address bv I union advocate (Mr. R. Rawke) i the judges and commissioners . &lt;«se inspected th i GMH plants. - Rigged | . But workers claim that condi- 1 tions were deliberately rigged 3 for the tour of inspection. if For example, production lines If were said to have slowed down | by 15 to 20 per cent during the II visit. I At Fishermen's Bend (Mel- 1 bourne) plant, one section "ran it out : of materials" half an hour j before the judges were due to 1 arrive. I In a statement released during 1 the early stages of hearing,, the 1 Federal secretary of the Vehicle I Builders' Union (Mr. R. Wilson) J said that the attitude of the r company was one of "frustra- it tion and confusion." j|. "This may seem strange when |! we recall that during the 1964 1 1 strike we were told by all and fl sundry — politicians and news- |j paper editorials alike, that we ! should take our claims to arbi- l i tration," said Mr. Wilson. || GMH made a profit last year of || £18.5 million despite the pro- 1| longed strike of last October. || Officials of the Vehicle Build- rj ers' Union and workers from the job are expected to give evi- 11 dence.
