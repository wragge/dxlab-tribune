 Wage win for builders gYDNEY: Carpenters and builders' labourers on the State Office Block project in Sydney won a 25/- a week site allowance from a sub contractor. The sub-contractor, A. J.

The employer has agreed to pay the claim retrospective to September 8 following numerous walk offs by his men.
