 THOUSANDS PAY RENT INCREASE UNDER THREATS SYDNEY : Thousands of people are being har assed and bamboozled into paying enormously in creased rents under the implied threat of eviction." MR J. RENSHAW, Leader , of the Opposition in the INoW Parliament, said this at a rally last Thursday night in support of Mr. E. Einfeld, Labor candidate for next Saturday's by-election for Bondi. Mr. Renshaw said: "A landlord has only to write to the Minister of Justice alleging that his tenant is within the "wealthy" tenant category, and that he is prepared to enter Into agreement, under Section 17a of the Landlor and Tenant Aet on the basis of current value rental." , "Then the rent controller writes, to the tenant asking him to fill in a questionaire." "The controller's standard letter says: 'If "within 21 days no explan ation satisfactory to the Minister for Justice is forthcoming, or no agree ment under section 17a, at the above quoted rent for a period of two years, I am directed by the Minister to in form you that action may be taken to exclude the premises from, parts 2, 3, 4 and 5 which will have the ef fect of depriving you of the protec tion of both rental and eviction pro visions of the "Act." Mr. Rensha.w went oh: "Since the Askin Government's Minister for Justice has returned to the pre-war and depresion days of wholesale evic tions, thousands of tenants, many of them here in this electorate of Bondi have received either formal notifica tion of denial of justice or worse. "They a-re receiving thinly-veiled threats from the landlords that un less the tenant agrees to pay such and such rental â€” usually far in excess of that being paid at the time, the land lord will write to the -Minister, who in turn will take the action outlined just now. Mr. Enfield told the rally that within two recent days he has been shown 76 letters received by Bondi tenants to come to agreement to pay as much as 100% Increases in rent.
