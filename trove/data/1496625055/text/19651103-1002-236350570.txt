 j Communists j j want J debate JHE Communist Party of MÂ«vnlra!if has written to NSW President of the Re turned Servicemen's League Sir William Yeo, and th iviuusier ror JLabor and Na tional Services, Mr. Mc- Mahon, renewing its offer to debate any RSL or Liberal Party spokesman under mu tually acceptable conditions. The Communist Party letter pro poses the debate be on "Whose policy is in Australia's best inter ests " The move follows renewed de mands for a "White Paper" on Communism made at the RSL's 50th national Congress in Adelaide last week, and false anti-commun ist statements by Mr. McMahon at a Sydney meeting (see page 8). One letter reminded Sir William Yeo that an offer to debate the RSI. leadership was lodged with the RSL headquarters in Sydney by a deputation of Communist ex-ser- . vicemen. The other letter points out that on three occasions in Sydney alone letters had been sent offering to debate, on the Vietnam question or other issues. All offers had been declined. On two occasions, at East Sydney and Waverley, halls had been hired and offers made of equal time to Liberal speakers. The meetings at Waverley, which was addressed by communist speak ers W. J. Brown and J. Barlow, condemned as "un-Australian" the Liberal Party's evasion of the pro posal for a fair and open contrast of policies before the people."
