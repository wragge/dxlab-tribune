 "Rusalka" — as , Film-opera I FEATURE of recent film festivals in Sydney and Melbourne has been the suc cess of the new films from Czechoslovakia. The wide variety of themes and styles of production made a most favorable impact. It is some years since a Czech film has had a commercial run in the local cinemas and Resulka now showing at Sydney's Savoy Theatre, is an outstanding production. It is based on £ie famous opera by Anton Dvorak. It tells the story of a water- nymph who falls in love with a mortal. Despite the warnings of the Water Sprite, she takes hu man form and joins her Prince. He becomes infatuated with a princess and Rusalka flees back to her home in the lake. She is doomed to the joyless existence of a will-o'-the-wisp. The Prince is driven by his longing for Rusalka to come to the lake where she appears to him. He dies in her arms. The director of the film, Vaclav Kaslik, is also a composer and conductor. He understands Dvorak's score and has skilfully adapted 'the opera for the wide screen. His use of camera and colour creates a suitable mood for the telling of the legend. The music is superbly recorded. The main parts are taken by actors and sung by soloists and chorus of the National Theatre, Prague. This synthesis of actor and singer is most effective. Jana Andrsova as Rusalka and Josef Hlinomaz as the Water Sprite are excellent. "Rusalka" is a film that is most entertaining and affords an opportunity to make accessible to the film public one of the gems of Czech music. Do not miss it!
