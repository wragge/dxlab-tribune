 Government defeat in local election issue SYDNEY : Plans of the Askin Government to gerry mander the NSW local government elections on December 4 were rebuffed in the Legislative Council last Wednesday... night. DY 27 to 36 votes the Council adjourned the second reading of the proposed bill for six months. Secretary of the N-S.W. labor Council Mr. Jim Kenny left hos pital accompanied by a doctor to cast the decisive vote against the gerrymander. A heavy blow against the Gov ernment prior to its defeat in the upper House was the complete rejection of its local government proposals after Local Government Association conference held in Blackheath, The reason Local Government Minister Mr. P. H. Morton desper ately piloted through the Legislative Assembly the second reading of his legislation, was on account of the Conference of the Local Govern ment Association meeting straight after. The legislation proposed to abolish proportional voting, the grouping of candidates on ballot papers and the direct election Of Mayors and pres idents. When he introduced the bill, Mr. Morton said that the Local Govern ment Association supported him on all but one of his proposals in the bill. And then the Local Government Association went into conference and rejected EVERY ONE of his proposals, Mr. H.' G. Coates, an independent of the Lower House, is the new president of the Local Government Association . . , and In parliament before the local government confer ence he fully supported every clause of Morton's bill except one . . the move to abolish the election by popular vote of mayors and presi dents. Mr. Coates was absent when a vote wast aken on the third read ing of the bill. This took place after the Local ' Government con ference.'' I
