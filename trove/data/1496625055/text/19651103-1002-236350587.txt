 PLENTY OF OFFICE BLOCKS, BUT FEW HOMES 1 1 £ANBERRA: Huge office - blocks were being built for which there were no tenants while the rate of urgently- needed house-building de clined, Mr. L. Devine said in the Federal Appropriations debate last week. "Owners of office blocks cannot attract sufficient tenants," said Mr. Devine, who succeeded Mr. Ward as Labor member for East Sydney. "However, although offices cannot be let, people are still investing in large construction projects of this type while there is a serious shortage of housing. "Many of my constituents have had to purchase homes with second mort gages and some have to pay £10, £12 or £14 a week." £8/10/-— one room Mr. Devine said one of his con- sttiuents was living with his wife and four children in one room, for which he was paying £8/10/- a week. The man had been waiting for two years for a Housing Commission house and would probably have to wait another three years before he got one. There were many similar cases throughout Australia. Housing Minister Bury had admit ted to a shortage of home-building finance, as a result of which the value of new homes built during. September had fallen by £1 million. Mr. A. W. James, Labor, NSW, said the Government's housing grant scheme had been just an election gimmick. Bury, in reply, said that to "inject" a large amount of finance into house building would increase prices. He admitted that it "might well be true" that we could do with fewer office blocks, but the Govern- . ment's powers were limited. fr
