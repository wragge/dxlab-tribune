 Death of Doreen Montgomery f ITHGOW: Mrs. Doreen Mont gomery, a stalwart Communist and very active organiser of Tribune sales over many years died on Octo- oer so. For several years Doreen helped to man the "Tribune" stand in Lithgow's main street every Saturday morning. She also sold many "Tribunes" on her regular run in the town. Doreen was "Tribune" organiser for the New South Wales Western Section of the Communist Party and a mem ber of the Section Committion. She worked on the selling of the workers' newspaper right up to the time of her death. Tribune's sympathy goes to her hus band and family in the loss of wife and mother, at comparatively early age. Doreen's passing will be felt as a severe loss by members of the Lith- gow and other western organisations of the Communist Party. Printed and published by . D.
