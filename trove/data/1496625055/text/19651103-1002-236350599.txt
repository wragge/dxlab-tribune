 Dig deep I for Tribune!! By JUNE MILLS Recently 1 had the pleasure of renewing acquaint ance with a friend of many years standing. Chatting over a drink, Frank told me how pleased he'd been to read the interview with D.R.A.Y. published a while ago in the Sydney Morning Herald. "yHY", I said, "didn't you believe me when 1 wrote in the column that 1 knew D.R.A.Y. and had talked to him?" My friend was another who hadn't really believed that anyone could be so generous in making donations to Tribune. Having seen the interview in the Herald he is now convinced, and what is more, he is going to believe what I write from now on. I want all readers to believe me when I say that to reach the £4,000 Tribune Fund target by the end of the year, we must average £124 each week. This will be hard to achieve without D.R.A.Y.'s donations, so I hope all readers will dip into their pockets for this special effort.
