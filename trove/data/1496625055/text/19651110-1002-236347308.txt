 "WE'LL EVEN TAKE FIVERS!" By JUNE MILLS V Three fivers and other large amounts among this week's donations suggests that my special appeal last week to all readers had a good effect. J BUT still if we are to reach that £4000 target still more must be done. How? An increase in the number of donations — small and large — is the way we'll get there. If it's too difficult to send the donations to me by post, then give them to your "Tribune seller. A special note to Bill Mac, Bel more. We are sorry that your donation was not paid in, but every thing is right now, so thank you for the promise of further help.
