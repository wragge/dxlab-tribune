 I VALUATIONS | I TO RISE I ! SOON? t V CYDNEY: The possibility of increases of 100 per cent or more in a new round of valuation increases beginning next year, was disclosed in Sutherland Shire Council by the Shire Clerk (Mr. M. Ho ward) last week. Communist Party teams have therefore made this isue a central point in their local campaigns in the present Council elections. Mr. Alex Elphinston, leader of the Cronulla Riding team, when address ing a street meeting last Saturday, pointed out how this could lead to huge water and land rate increases. Up to 50 people listened intently. Other speakers, including Mr. T. Payne and Mrs. P. Elphinston, indi cated how water rates have become a serious burden to pensioners and other retired people. No rebates are available to pensioners who often use little water, but are forced to pay an exorbitant amount. They said that Communist policy included a full rebate for all pen sioners, made possible by an alloca tion of ten per cent, of Federal revenue (Â£21 per head of the popu lation) and increasing taxation on monopoly. The election of Communists to Council would lead to vigorous cam paign on these issues, and their campaign needed the fullest assist ance.
