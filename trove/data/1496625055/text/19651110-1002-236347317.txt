 Government blasted for neglect of education [?] "The 1965 Annual Survey of NSW Second ary Schools showed that of 1 2,000 secondary school teachers In NSW teaching 200,000 pupils, only 6,000 had been able to com » j olefe four years of training at a teachers' B fraiffling bwncyc. a -Mr. S. Lewis, President of the NSW B Teachers' Federation, said this last week. 9 "There are not nearly enough facilities available 8 for training teachers satisfactorily," Mr. Lewis said. '"THIS does not mean that two-year-trained teach ers don't do a good job. In many cases they do extra work and try to finish their degrees in their own time, often at the expense of their health.." Federation Secretary- .Mr. I. G. Lancaster said there was "an imme diate need for four new teachers' training coleges." Possible sites were Kingsford and Chatswood (Sydney), Lismore and Goulburn. ) "There are far too few scholarships .for (teacher training, even if the col- leges could accommodate them," Mr. Lancaster said. "In 1965, only 3,500 scholarships were granted to 10,000 successful ap plicants. "Added to this, many students leave the teaching profession after complet- 1 1 ing four years training and accept I higher paid jobs in private industry. ; I "Private industry pays the student's j scholarship bond to the Education De- 8 parment. I "The bond is £500 for a pass student | and £1,000 for an honours student. I "Allocation in the State Budget for primary schools in 1965 was £342,000 less than in 1964," Mr. Lancaster said, "but there were several thous and more enrolments." College coEiditions "shocking"! Mr. D. Broadfoot said that except for Armidale and Wollongong condi tions at teachers' colleges were shock ing and "would not be tolerated in ; industry." "Wollongong Teachers' College built : in 1963 was the first teachers' col lege built in N.S.W. since Armidale in 1928," Mr. Broadfoot said. Mrs. G. Phelan, research officer, : produced a summary of the 1965 | survey of N.S.W. secondary schools. II The survey showed up the neglect I of education. Among other things: I 69,000 children In N.S.W. secon- I flary schools are in classes which are I officially recognised as too large. I The numner of 2-year-trained | teachers taking 4th and 5th year classes is increasing, sj Increased numbers of teachers : j are obliged to take subjects outside their own field of training— -740 in 1965 compared with 380 in 1964. ' 104 schools have no trained art teacher, 97 no trained music teacher, 90 without a trained phys. ed. teacher. 130 schools reported 200 or more extra periods so far in 1965, 53 schools more than 500 extra periods, and several schools reported 1000 or more extra periods. Makeshift accommodation is be ing used for classrooms, including rented halls, locker rooms, corridors, hat rooms, staff rooms store rooms, weathersheds, and condemned Army huts. "The State Budget provides for only 25 more Teachers' College lec turers than last year, and there is no provision whatever for the estab lishment of additional teachers' colleges," Mrs. Phelan said. "At the same time the Budget pro vides increased sums for State aid to private schools— £560,000 in 1965 com pared with £258,000 in 1964". "Without immediate action to remedy the situation, the introduc tion of the Wyndham Report in 1966 will only increase the burden on teachers and parents, and make it even harder for pupils' to get the all- round, rich education the Report re commends," Mrs. Phelan said. "Unless the State reviews its edu cation grant and the Federal Govern ment gives financial assistance the next generation of Austra lians who will live in a highly auto mated economy will be unable either to cope with the new employment standards or enjoy the extra hours of leisure," Mrs. Phelan said. Last Thursday the federation called on the N.S.W. Labor Council, unions and interested bodies to join with teachers in demanding Federal finance to improve teacher training.
