 [?] Despite appeals of Indonesia's President Sukarno and Information Minister Ahmadi for an end to the kindling of hatred by one political --grouping against another, many Djakarta papers aay in and day out under huge headlines make charges against Com munists and demand the immediate disband- ment of the Communist Party and leftwing mass organisations. This is reported by Pravda's correspondent i in Djakarta, according to a cable from Rupert Lockwood, Tribune's Moscow correspondent. Many Indonesian leaders declare, Pravda says, that events in Indonesia would have no -effect on anti-imperialist foreign policy. "C ne canrot but notice, however j that the cn- n let loose in Indonesia against Communist and democratic organisations meets warm approval exactly of those . : forces which are pressing for change in Indonesia's anti-imperialist policy. The activities of the Communist Party and leftwing mass organisations, he adds, are now "practically banned throughout Indonesia"., American news agencies report the dis- l missals of leftwing land reform court Judges, of all civilians who are members . of the Com munist Party or other left organisations from Government institutions, and the suspension of -37 progressive Deputies from Parliament, including leading Communist Deputies Luk- man and Njoto, who are Cabinet members. However, Njoto was at +he latest Cabinet meeting last week.
