 Socialism and hunting ""TRIBUNE recently carried a re- j port that an estimated 400,000 j tourists will visit Western Russia | this summer and ends by saying that foreign visitors are receiving licences to hunt bears in Siberia and elks in Western forests (pre sumably with a gun). Nothing wrong with the tourists being there but surely something is wrong for a socialist government to hand out licences to foreign tourists to kill native fauna. These tourists obviously would not belong to the £20 a week group and in many cases no doubt re ceive dividends from the exploita tion of the workers In their par ticular country. This is on the same level as the Australian Government recently is suing pamphlets through Australia House in London advertising the ' shooting of Australian fauna as an attraction for tourists to come here. Tourists who come to see — yes! Tourists who come with the gun — no? F. Barclay, Narrabeen (N.S.W.).
