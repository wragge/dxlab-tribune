 South of the 17th Parallel T HAVE just completed reading a book entitled "South of the 17th Parallel." I consider this book well worth a onnrf tVlnor nn aenniint of thfi vivid history it portrays of the tyrannical policy of the former Ngo Dinh Diem administration. The hook relates many case his tories of individuals who have suffered and died at the hands of Ngo Dinh Diem's "anti-Communist teams" simply because they dared to criticise the . American puppet government's policies. I would like to quote an excerpt from this book: - "In a village or the province of g Bac Lieu, for four consecutive g months, 'anti - Communist teams' 1 forced the population to exhaust g themselves without obtaining the g least result. At the end of their j resources, they finally decided to I arrest a young woman and to shoot g her publicly: this would make the g others reflect. Despite the opposi- ! tion of her executioners, the young i woman shouted: g " The Nationalist Government have -g arrested my husband, and now they ! are shooting me. I die without | regrets because I have done my j duty. Compatriots, bring up my g two young children. When they are I grown up, tell them their parents J fell for peace and the reunification g of the country!' | "Then she shouted: 'Long live ! President Ho Chi Minh! Long live j Vietnam reunited in peace!' I "This moving farewell and the g reports of the rifles which shot her i down only revive in peoples' hearts | hatred for the American interven- i tionists and Ngo Dinh Diem." s The Menzies Government can con veniently forget these facts while propogating its filthy policy. It is easier for Menzies, the Daily Tele- j graph and the Liberal Party pamph- J leteer to forget the crimes com- I mitted by the Ngo Dinh Diem j regime of South Vietnam in the g name of "anti-Communism" than it ! is for the Vietnamese patriots who I ouilCicU UJLCIiJ. i Ex-liberal (NSW). j
