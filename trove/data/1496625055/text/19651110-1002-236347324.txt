 still unprotected NEW LEGISLATION DOES MUCH FOR THE PROTECTION OF W.A. FISH RESOURCES . . . BUT PERTH: The Fisheries Act Amendment Bill (No. 2) introduced in the Legislative Council last week is a big step forward in the protection of West Austra lian fish resources. "|N the main I support the legislation that has been made to date, because a major portion of it is based on the recommendations of the honorary Royal Conr.Tiis- sion on the fishing industry/' said Mr. Ron Thompson, MLC, who was a member of the Commission. "All members of the Commission are pleased with the outcome of i,t. Action has been taken by the govern ment on about 75 per cent of its recommendations, as a Tesult of con tinued pressure on the question. ' The new Bill provides for the licen sing of fish processors, including freezer boats, with minimum penalties of £1,000, maximum £2,000 and con tinuing penalties for each day an of- . fence continues. Licence fees and penalties will be | paid into a special Treasury fund to be used solely for fisheries research, exploration, development and exten sion. Mr. Thompson said there was only one thing in recent legislation that he was opposed to— the escape gap provision in cray pots. "Although it may be well-inten tioned, it can easily be evaded," he said. "A piece of wood, a stick or even a piece of string could be used to block the escape of undersized crays." Action to put a spoke in the under sized cray racket is certainly over .due, as shown by the report by the general manager of the Fremantle Fishermen's co-op on his return from America In Los Angeles an importer showt him 316 boxes of under size W A. era;, fish, wrongly marked with the correc size.
