 Local Government B,G business monopolies will no doubt be represented by eminent counsel and "experts" on Local Government, before the Royal Commission enquiring into Local Government finances, in an endeavor to influence its deci sions in their favor. This fact is borne out by a bro chure issued in the name or "The. International Research Committee on Real Estate Taxation" and circu- - lated by the "N.S.W. Land Values Research Committee, of Sydney." The brochure illustrates the com parative incidence of water rates, under the different rating systems, on 92 of the biggest monopolies in the Sydney metropolitan and Port Kembla areas. The brochure contains a graph, showing the area of ratable land, the unimproved capital value, the improved capital value and the assessed annual value of each com pany. A comparison is made of the rates paid by each company to the Metropolitan Water and Sewerage Board on the assessed annual value and the amount that would have been paid, if they were rated on the unimproved capital value. The total savings for the 92 com panies would he £174,639 if they were rated on the UCV. Many home owners believe that they would be .relieved of much. of their burden if they were rated for water on the UCV (value of land only) instead of on the TCV (value of land plus the home), but this would only he so if the . rate in the £ remained at about the present rate. In which case the Water Board would have to have an alternative means of finance to meet its com mitments. This should come from the national revenue in the form of grants from the Federal Govern ment Mick Ryan, New Lambton (NSW>.
