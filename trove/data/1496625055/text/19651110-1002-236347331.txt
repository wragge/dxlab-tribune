 UN calls on Britain: Liberate Rhodesia and Aden yHE United Nations Trus teeship Council last week overwhelmingly deman d e d that Britain immediately liqui date its military base in Aden. Voting was 83 to 11, with eight r abstentions, showing that the great weight of world opinion was in favor of independence for the Adenis. The resolution was sponsored by 38 Arab, Asian and African states, and will now go to the General As sembly. Later, first the Trusteeship Coun cil and then the General Assembly carried, against Britain's wishes, a resolution demanding the immediate liberation of the 4,000,1300 Africans of Rhodesia now held in forcible sub jection by the white racist minority headed by Ian Smith. Australia voted against the resolu tion. The British Labor Government is leaning over backwards to avoid us ing force against Smith, while Smith uses force, including savage dogs to attack African demonstrators. The London New Statesman, keen supporter of the Government, asks: "How much further is Mr. Wilson going to retreat to meet the out rageous demands of the Smith cab inet?" But in Aden, there is no BritLh reluctance to use force against the people, who don't want" to be forced into a Malaysia-type "South Arabian Federation". The constitution was suspended, direct rule by a British official in- " stituted, and patriots were attacked and jailed. The UN Trusteeship Council and General Assembly resolutions leave British imperialism in no doubt as to what world opinion thinks both of its appeasement of white racial ism in Rhodesia and its suppression of Arab nationalism in Aden.
