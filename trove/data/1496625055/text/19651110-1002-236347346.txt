 australian\ i book week "fil VE AUSTR A L I A N BOOKS" is the slogan for Australian Book Week, to be held from November 13 to 20 this year. While the emphasis will be on Aus tralian books, attention will be drawn to publications froni all over the world. In our country many new writers are emerging, and the "ewly -formed Australian Society of Authors is looking after the interests of its hundreds of members. The Fellowship of Australian Writers, The Realist Writers, P.E.N., Writers' Guild and literary appre ciation groups operate in most States. Some produce their own journal, including Realist Writers, "The Realist." Overland, Westerly, Southerly, Quadrant, Australian Letters, Mean- jin Quarterly, Arenaâ€” all enter into the battle of ideas in literature. ? HHHE Australasian Book Society assists by publishing books written in the Australian tradition and is providing avenues of expres sion for progressive novels. As in other Australian industries, the trend in book publishing is that bigger firms are swallowing smaller ones; although local publishing houses have, in the main, kept up a good standard both in the quality and content of their product. Events such as Australian Book Week, though highly commercialised, can assist Australian writers.
