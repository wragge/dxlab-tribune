 PROFESSOR DEFENDS ABORIGINES ADELAIDE: Chairman of the SA Aboriginal Affairs Board (Prof. A. A. Abbie) has strongly defended the action of the State Labor Government in lifting the drinking ban on Aborigines. He was replying to critics of the Government's move, who claim that it had created ynjblems of excessive drinking by Aborigines. Prof. Abbie said had SA not lifted the ban it would have stood out as "an island of prohibitive self-righte ousness." Other states lifted the ban and had experienced only a few problems. Naturally, he said, some problems would arise. The Professor said that "the blame for any excesses today must be put to the discredit of the whites — to their attitude towards Aborigines in the past and to their restrictive legislation that invited defiance, and would have provoked similar de fiance in whites ha'd they :been in the same position." He. continued: "In the outcome all that was achieved was the creation of bad drinking habits. "We are told the restrictions were lifted too suddenly, that we should have waited a few more years until the Aborigines were better prep'.red. "This ancient argument ha held up every attempt at procrra/g for over a century. "On such reasoning we sb Aid wait until ' the Aborigines become super- . hians,— far , superior to 'v whites, in- , \ie 'yisjk ;expsing them , tp tpiptafiQh J Tyhfchi .
