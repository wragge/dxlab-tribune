I I AND last week 300 dog- | men, riggers, scaffold- | ers and hoist drivers | throughout the Sydney met- Iropolitan area stopped work in support of this wage j demand. iThe men are demanding a flat ' rate of £23/5/- plus a multi storey allowance of £3 plus £4 danger | money, giving a total wage of | £30/5/- a week. j This demand was first made to | the employers last year. | Following a mass strike meet- | ing last week the men marched to J and demonstrated outside the S Master Builders Association's of- | fices in Newtown. I A deputation led by BLF State secretary, Mr. M. McNamara, met I the employers' spokesmen who | agreed to discuss the claim at an | early date.
