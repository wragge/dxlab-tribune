 Tenants will be at (the landlords' mercy! 2 SYDNEY: The Askin Liberal Government of New 1 South Wales, by proposing to eliminate all obligation on landlords to provide "a Iternative acco m m o d a- tion", has again reveled that it means to make the Landlord and Tenant1 Act a dead Setter for- tenants. JHE plan is to legislate to remove the "alter native accommodation" provision in the NSW Landlord and Tenant Act. The fate of such legisla tion will depend on the stand | taken by the now hostile Leg- I islative Council. j'-j The Renshaw Labor Govern- j ment restored the "alternative I accommodation" provision in 1 December 1964. Now this pro- h vision is again in jeopardy, i K; The requirement that a landlord must provide "reasonably suitable alternative accommodation" when $ seeking to evict a tenant does pro- f vide some measure of protection to f\ tenants as it is difficult for a land- f lord to provide alternative accom- modation of comparable size, style I ? and rent. I I The continued housing shortage and tif the decontrol of premises vacated || since April, 1958, have contributed to || these difficulties. I Exceptions & i || The legislation of December, 1964, || did expand the exceptions to the || rule: Alternative accommodation need || not be provided — || where the owner has owned the p premises for eight years and I reasonably requires" it for his j own occupation; ! | where the owner is more than !
