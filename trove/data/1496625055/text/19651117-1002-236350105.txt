 The price of sugar JTOR the past three years I have been reading your paper with interest and substantial agreement with the editorial news expressed. I was therefore somewhat discon- certed when I did not see any j comment upon sugar prices in the j paper. You have consistently, and justly, | opposed the manner in which mono- I poly interests have instantly increas- ed the retail prices of commodities j upon the wholesale price being in- j creased. j Recently, the financial reports of j the major sugar refineries (C.S.R., j Pioneer, Millaquin) stated that the reason for their profits being markedly below expectations was the big drop in wholesale prices for refined sugar. The point to be noted by air j workers is that although the whole- j sale price of sugar fell by many j pounds per ton, the retail price j did not fall by so much as one ! penny. I B.
