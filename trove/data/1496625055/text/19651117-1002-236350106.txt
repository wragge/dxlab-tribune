 [?] Silence on Vietnam means condoning aggression THOSE responsible for the wholesale carnage in south and north Vietnam should, on the basis of the Atantic Chart- er, be tried as war criminals. German nazis and Japanese pol itical & military leaders were tried Under war crimes statutes for- var ious crimes including mass mur-. ders. It is transparently clear that the United States is out to decimate the population of Vietnam by use of the most inhuman methods. Let those who believe in the peo ple speak up. It is futile and wrong to remain silent. Silence on this question of life and death would mean condoning aggression. F. Margin (ex- World War 1), Brisbane (Q'ld).
