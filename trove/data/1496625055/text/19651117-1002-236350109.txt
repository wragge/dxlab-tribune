 Marxists and Aust. Hs'ory | READ with interest the re port of the meeting of Com munist intellectuals (Tribune, October 20). One crying need in my opinion is for a Marxist work on The Peo ple's History of Australiaâ€” starting from the first settlement in 1788. There are, of course, many works on our history, but most that I have read gloss over the class Issues and do so "for obvious reasons. Australia is a fine country because of the labor of its-people. It will be an even finer , country under socialism. A book or a series of pamphlets dealing with the part played by the working people and their organ isations in the growth and develop ment of our country could help us a lot on the road forward.
