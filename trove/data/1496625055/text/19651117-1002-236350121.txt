 1 TRIBUNE | Referendum fkiE referendum announced by the Menzies Gov ernment — a nation-wide vote of all Australian electors on two questions — is important. The referendum. a traditional Australian democratic form, though infrequently used, is ALWAYS important The announcement has been followed by the report that some Federal back-benchers of both Labor and Liberal Parties will move to add a new question for inclusion in the referendum, which- is to be held next May. Of the two questions to be put by the Menzies Govern ment, one concerns an amendment to Section 127 of the Constitution, so that in future the Commonwealth Census will include Aborigines (previously excluded). It is bard to imagine anyone opposing such an overdue step. As slated earlier in Tribune by Professor F. Rose, it it little more than a recognition that such a census is now physically POSSIBLE — it would hardly have been so at the turn of the certury.
