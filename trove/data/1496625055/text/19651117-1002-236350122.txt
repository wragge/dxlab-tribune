 [?] with Noel Counihan I I e i ! i i i 9 ADELAIDE SCHOOL OF ARTS | RECENTLY spent some time in the only school in Australia designed specifically as a modern art school. The Adelaide School of Arts is a fine, stimulating struc ture, built around an attract- ive courtyard, with well | equipped studios for sculp- g ture, painting and life draw- I ing, printniaking, pottery and jj textile design. g The set-up in the sculpture, S printcmaking and history of I art departments is unusually g satisfactory. s Most of the students will be- | come art ceacners. n After the dreary overcrowded | quarters common to art I schools in other cities this I school is exciting. | But its defects are obvious, the | result of the architects' in- | itial failure to consult with g artists and art teachers. g Concern with form at the ex- 1 pense of function led to | erection of a trellis screen | rising the full height of the S . building, between it and the I courtyard, obstructing the i light and depriving the work g rooms of valuable space. I A spacious canteen occupies | the beautifully lit top floor, $ the ideal space for the paint- 9 ing studios now cramped 3 downstairs. g 1 and ART GALLERY J Adelaide's Art Gallery on &lt;jj North Terrace is blessed with 1 I cool and airy galleries. | j Inexplicably their walls have ; ! been painted the colours of ! j blue or pink icing and faced I j with similarly colored, inad- | j equate screens for displaying | ( the pictures. | The pictures battle against the | confection and the character | of the galleries is utterly S destroyed. | | JOHN BRACK JOHN BRACK, painter and f head of the Victorian Nat- | ional Gallery Art School was 1 recently invited to address | the Art Teachers' Association | H© shocked many of his g audience by claiming that art | matriculants, unable either to g draw or paint, are the worst I equipped studenlts to apply | for entry into the Gallery | School. | I understand he lays the blame jj on contemporary departmental 6 emphasis on self-expression | at the expense of basic in- jj struction. jj ' 9 I ARCHIBALD PRIZE j It will be interesting to observe g j the effect on the next Archi- | j bald Prize competition of | : newly promoted Gallagher I j International £1500 Prize for j j a portrait painted "from life | j and in the contemporary f ! manner", whatever that may I I mean. 1 j This is serious competition for g the rather jaded annual. | 9 6 IAN ARMSTRONG j ! THE most refreshing collection | | of contemporary portraits I jj j have seen for some time I were those of Ian Armstrong | j at the Australian Galleries, j j Collingwood, in October. 1 | Armstrong is the Drawing In- | structor at the Nation tl | Galleiy School. S His collection contained vivid, D realistic portraits of people | Armstrong was interested in, g painted with feeling for their I j personalities, and free of the g ! cold contrived manner so | common to commissioned | j portraits or those painted | ! with prizewinning in mind. g
