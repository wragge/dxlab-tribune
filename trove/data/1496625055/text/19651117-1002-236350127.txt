 MENZIES ACTS- BUT HATES IT! Tribune's Parliamentary Roundsman CANBERRA: "My colleagues and I have great reserva tions about even economic sanctions", Prime Minister Men- zies admitted as he announced in Parliament on Tuesday a list of sanctions by Australia against the illegal Rhodesian regime of racist Ian smith. 9 Ban on export of arms and military equipment. 9 Suspension of tariff prefer ences. 9 Ban on import of tobacco. Withdrawal of Australia's Trade Commissioner from Salisbury. It is understood that most Cabinet Ministers just wanted to wait and see what Britain and the United Nations 1 decided to do. ! . But under pressure from other Com- : monwealth countries, they agreed to ! follow the British positionâ€” that it is ; better to take economic measures to > try to bring Smith back to the con- , ference table than allow a vacuum ! that could be filled by African military intervention or a UN peace-keeping ' force. , i What the Government is really after, 1 having in mind its past record of sup- i port for the racist regime of South i Africa, is summed up in Menzies statement that: "It is, alas, quite clear that , if the ?\ UN authorised armed forces, the clamor would be for immediate -\ adult suffrage, the application of which would quite plainly have at best hazardous, and at worst tiis- > astrous, results." I Further light was shed by his words \ "Any notion of the use of armed force i would he repugnant to Australians". "i Having in mind that this Govern- ) ment has committed 1500 Australian j troops to participate in the brutal : US war in Vietnam under a policy of "no alternative to armed force" his ; unashamed hypocrisy can be explain- i ed only by a fervent desire to save white supremacy in Rhodesia in some form.
