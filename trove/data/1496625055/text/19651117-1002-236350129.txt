 I Ustashi In stew attack 1 MELBOURNE: A Yugoslav I migrant struck on the head by Ustashi (Croatian nazi) thugs I on Saturday, November 6, was still on the seriously ill list m a Melbourne hospital on Monday this week. Daily press and police have apparently ignored the matter. The man, Mr. Gojko Lakic, was struck with a full bottle of beer just as he was getting into a car outside the Exhibition Building following a ball attended by Yugoslavs. He was one of four Yugoslav migrants injured in the attack. Mr. Lakic, the father of a six-month-old child, had been in Australia only eight days at the time of the attack. He and his friends did not know that the ball had been arranged by Ustashi elements I under the auspices of their reli- I glous front organisation, the I so-called Cardinal Steplnac Society, recently outlawed by the I Catholic hierarchy in Melbourne. 1 Mr. Stevo Sajkovic, also badly I hurt in the attack said this | week that he, Lakic, and other 1 friends had been sitting at their 1 table, some with their wives. A man approached and asked, "Do you speak Croatian?" "We speak Yugoslav," was the reply. "This seemed to send the man into a rage," said Mr. Sajkovic. "He grabbed a chair, and broke it over the head of our friend Paul Laba. Paul had to have four stitches." "Then we were attacked by a mob of about 30 men using their fists and bottles." A policeman present at the scene apparently took no action. Last week Tribune revealed that police in two states have raided Italian families but ignore the activities of the Ustashi.
