 The Mother's Pledge My soldier son: Somewhere on this earth A few of great wealth Profited by your birth. Weaned you with sure stealth, Put killing in your heart, Obedience in your mind. Placing you and I apart; I, to grieve, resigned, Lnd you to serve a gun. My son! My son! My soldier son. Now you are gone: Somewhere overseas, The richer by your death Men talk of victories. With exultant breath Praise "supreme sacrifice" To guard a way of life . . . Gained by loaded dice Outbidding peace for strife And dividends won. My son! My son! My soldier son. My soldier son: In my heart I feel That I grieve not alone. Whilst yet blood brims the weal Of dreamings overthrown, I pledge no yield of other sons Shall in vain slaughter die: No mother's love be food for guns To sanctify a lie. I pledge this shall be done; My son! My son! My soldier son. â€”CECIL S. WATTS.
