 [?] I Eddie Miller! ( l ii j a boxing great I By guest columnist Ron Mackerras I I With Rocky Gattellari's world title chance I coming up on December 2, followers of boxing J I may be interested to know of the rough road that ) | some of the relative "old-timers" had to travel to H | get their chance. For instance, compared with | Eddie Miller's, some will no doubt agree that the j i I "Rock" has so far been fortunate. ! Eddie Miller, who at differ- | ent times held both the Aus- | tralian bantamweight and S featherweight titles, has gone 1 down in boxing as one of our | cleverest glovemen. r Miller was a product of the de- I! pression years even though he won his titles in the more pros perous '40's, and fought for the g British Empire featherweight ! title in August 1949 at Liver- I pool, England. i . Eddie Miller arrived in Austra- ! lia at the age of nine with his j parents, who settled at Kandos. \ At school he was taught by W. I J. O'Reilly, later to become | famous as Australia's Test g bowler for many years. ! In 1934, after Eddie had tur.- I ned 17, the Miller family moved I to Sydney, where work though ! - scarce, was more plentiful than | in Kandos. | In Sydney, Miller joined an g amateur boxing club which had I a. small gym in the grandstand j at Wentworth Park. Here he re- I ceived his early tuition from I Jock Frame, a former Scottish | top liner, who later advised him !to attend Jack Dunleavy's gym. In those days Dunleavy stag- ! . ed tria-l bouts every Thursday | afternoon to assess the pot- | ential of the hordes of boxers ! —mostly unemployed— who I flocked there in the hope of earning some cash in the pro fessional ring. Miller soon impressed and re ceived a shower of coins from " the spectators and Dunleavy of- j fered him tuition free of charge. I .Unemployed, Miller spent Ills j days at Dunleavy's sweeping the f floors and doing odd jobs. In the afternoon he stood outside j the gym door with a collection j tin for donations from the I ! spectators . who regularly watch- I | ed the workouts. j Miller lost his first two bouts I on points and decided to retire. I | .. Dunleavy did not argue with s | him, but adyised him to keep j | coming along to the gym just S | to keep in condition. g I Several months later he was ! tricked into bringing his gear I | along to the stadium and fought j | a four rounder against Billy Ed- g | wards, winning by a K.O. in the I last round. He was then on his j | way to boxing success. | | In 1939 Ern McQuillan took i I over Miller's management from I f| Dunleavy, who was in bad health j || and wanted to concentrate on his » S gymnasium. | I In 19,40 Micky Miller surrend- j 1 ered his bantamweight crown due j | to increasing weight. Elimination ? g bouts were staged for the vacant I | title and Eddie Miller through j 1 !.- them became officially recognis- j I ed as the new champion. | B I Miller's last elimination bout I | was against Liam Wilson in Bris- | | bane. He won by a K.O. in the fifth and his cut of the gate was ! £33. Later in his career ana ngni- j ing as a .featherweight he met | Vic Patrick and was T.K.O'd in I the sixth— but his purse was | £1034. . | In 1947 Miller had a most sue- j | cessful season in the British Isles ; ! and .effortlessly disposed of al | j the best boxers of his weight j - seen in Britain since the legend- , ary Jim Driscoll. . j ! In 1948 he returned to Australia i j and was called on to defend his i : featherweight title against Vi- » h torian Frank Flannery and won | on a foul in the tenth round. j i With his Australian title, safe, ; Miller returned to England I where he had been promised an j j Empire title fight by promo j ; Jack Solomons. I I 1 The fight took place in Liver- I I pool in August 1949 against the | I j British champion Ron CIayton.' | | | Miller with his clever boxin„ . I | ran to a big points lead, bu , j ! 32 years of age had left | I lenge too late, and found the j I rounds of the title fight just too ! much. In the 12th round, his let j . I gave out and he was counted j by the referee as he sat on tn floor, too exhausted to haul him j self to his feet. . Miller retired and returned 1 | Australia and bought a . r. ! "bourne hotel but later tra i red his ring earnings into j business at Mornington. o—
