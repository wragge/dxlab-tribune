 I DEFENCE OF j I ABORIGINES I j ADELAIDE: L i b e r a > I j . Party leader of the Op j ! position (Sir 1 homas Play- j ! ford) has unsuccessfully J | tried to prevent officers oi j ! r the AboriginaE Affairs De- | j partment having access to g | Aborigines on pastoral ! | leases. ! | The Labor Government has j I expressed concern about condi- I I tions of Aborigines living on j- such leases, although not em- j | ployed. This was the reason for j J a regulation under the Aboriginal g I Affairs Act giving officers access ! | to these people. J ! Had Sir Thomas' move to dis- J j allow this regulation been sue- = g cessful, it would have left the i I Aboriginal people completely at f j the mercy of pasto'ralists. jj | Yet Sir Thomas described the ; g' regulation as "an infringement ol ? | the rights of the citizen." T | The Attorney-General (Mr g Dunstan) described Aborigines ! living on pastoral leases as the ) "most underprivileged" people i in SA. j j Sir Thomas' attempt to prevent f I access was defeated in a vote in j | the House of Assembly. j
