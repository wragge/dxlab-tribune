 reiyc I |A GOOD DAY FOR THE RACES By JUNE MILLS Walking down Bathurst Street toward 168 Day Street one fine morning last week an old friend in the Communist Party caught up with me. "IT'S a nice morning", he said, and opening his wal- let, he took out a fiver. "Put this in Tribune Fund for me, June". Thanks a lot, P.B. This Christmas present certainly made it a fine morning. Prom Ray, of Dry Dock, comes a donation of 12/-. We understand that Ray may be able to make further donations and will certainly welcome him to our growing bands of regulars. "Criterion Shout" is another little story. Some of the hoys were having a drink recently. They left the change for one of the boys to bring to Tribune. This is an idea which others might consider.
