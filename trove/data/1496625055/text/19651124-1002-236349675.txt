 Rabbie was interviewed by "security", too DON MACKERRAS is pretty right in assuming that Rab bie Burns, if alive today, would be a certain target for security investigation. In a recently published fiction- cum-biography of the great poet I read that Burns actually was "quiz zed" by the security service of his day — or at any rate that his opinions and actions -were the -subject of close governmental scrutiny. Burns died, aged 37, in 1796, almost before the "Reign of Terror" period of the French Revolution ended. Three -years previously Britain had declared war against revolutionary France, and Burns, sharing the pre vailing fear of an invasion, had writ ten what, coming from a great work- ers' poet, may to some have seemed mildly jingoistic verses— or could it have been he just didn't .believe in the "export of revolution"? Apparently these pro-British verses helped tip the scales in his favor, as he was cleared of all charges, his loyalty being above suspicion. To my present knowledge there is no record of Burns' sentiments con cerning the proscription and execu tions during the short-lived "Reign of Terror". Whatever his misgivings in that regard, one thing seerns certain. A man of his calibre would shed no tears over the downfall of the Bour bons and their aristocratic followers J. M. Stuart, Perth (W.A.).
