 NSW GOVT. MAY SLASH SCHOOL BUILDING TRIBUNE'S STATE POLITICAL ROUNDSMAN SYDNEY: The State Minister for Educa- tion (Mr. Cutler) dropped a bombshell last week by ordering a review of all school works planned by the . previous (Labor) gov ernment for completion in the next three years. This puts in question the future of education projects vovth £45 million. This could be the biggest test yet faced by the Askin Liberal Govern ment. Labor leader Renshaw has already served notice that the Opposition will make it a major issue in Parliament. - It is believed that during the present financial year, school build ing projects of up to £4 million will be cut. Mr. Cutler has alleged that the previous Government . over- committed itself by £4 million pounds for this financial year. The £4 million would mean that 13 secondary schools worth £300,000 each would not be built. School projects now under the chopping block include 28 high schools promised by the previous Government to he completed by 1967, as well as new primary schools and badly needed alterations to existing schools, The Council 'of the NSW Teachers' Federation' has described the situa tion as "a severe threat to ; public education im NSW," standing in con- trast with Premier Askln's election promise of a "new look" at educa tion. The "new look" was supposed to include the speeding up the building of school buildings. The Federation nas called on the State Government as a matter of urgency to recast its proposed State budgetary and loan expenditure on education to provide an increase " in budget expenditure at least equal to the 1964-65 increase, and loan expen diture sufficient to carry out the minimum program of works planned by the Labor Government. It also called on the Common wealth Government to provide large sums of money to help meet the urgent needs of education.
