 | Fight fori | higher wages i CYDNEY: The Australian J Council of Trade Unions' I application for a wage | margins rise of £2/16/- a I week will further stimulate j the rising campaign in all | States for wage rises to t cope with soaring prices. | In this struggle in many in- j stances the workers are linking j up the struggle for wage in- J creases and the trade union | campaign for price control. j The ACTU lodged its applies- | tion with the Conciliation and I Arbitration Commission on Tues- 1 day. It had already lodged a | claim for a basic wage increase j of 38/- a week. | If the basic wage claim was J granted it would still only give | a capital cities average basic j wage of £17/18/- a week. | The application for a basic g wage rise is expected to be | presented to the Arbitration j Commission in March next year. 1 "When the Arbitration Court | granted a li per cent., or about | 6/-, rise in wages last June g (swallowed up by price rises 1 almost immediately it was | granted) the Court also decided | j that there should be no increase 1 ' in basic wage or margins on | ' the ground of price rises. j It decided, too, that there j should be an annual review of f the economy, including wages, thus virtually pegging wages for | at least 12 months; and it de- | clared that price increases would, g be taken into account when | wage rates were next reviewed, j GREEN LIGHT j The Trade Union Movement 1 at the time said that this was J the "green light" for price in- | creases. I Soaring prices have proved I this prediction true, and have I given rise to many actions by j workers for wage increases. g In Sydney recently the Dis- J putes Committee of the NSW I Labor Council accepted by a j narrow majority a wage settle- ! ment for Government transport | workers far below what they | had struggled for over three g . years. J VICTORIA j Demands for over-award pay- | ments are mounting in Victoria, j A campaign for over-award pay- g ments of £3/19/- a week for their J j members has been. launched by | | the Meat Industry Employees' | ; Union, with the endorsement of I ! the Trades Hall Council. J I A meeting of the Victorian j j Wages Board on December 10 g ; will decide on an application by. j the Retail Traders' Association I for a female basic wage in the 2 award for shop assistants. I This, if successful, would cut g the wages of thousands of female | shop assistants by £3/17/- a week, g I Shop assistants, both male and i ; female, like other workers are I | in need of wage increases and g ; are not likely to accept wage 1 . cuts.
