 _jm_ | H. G. Palmer crash i moil Maims I 1 he H. G. Palmer a.air is one of the most infamous I in the commercial life of this State", a Labor MLA said in j the NSW Parliameht yesterday. ! TT "has every appearance of being one of super colossal financial skul- duggery, involving some of the lead ing figures of big business in this state." Mr. Mallam M.L.A. said this when speaking to a motion of urgency which called for inspectors to be appointed' under the Companies Act to investigate the affairs of H.G. Palmer, their form er auditors, and the actiyities of 7T L.C. Limited. "There are no less than 33,000 -stock holders who invested in H.G. Pal mers," said Mr. Mallam. "Many did so after reading a prospectus show-,; mg H.G. Palmers as a subsidiary of ML.C "and believed that the mighty r.L.C. was their guarantor." ' "They can starve while the scound j rels who swindle them can still live -off the fat of the land." -' . The Attorney General (Mr. McCaw) ; g asked the House to reject the motion S because appointment of inspectors j under the Companies Act was unwar- | ranted at this time. Already there was ar> investigation under way under the | supervision of the Registrar of com- g panies, in which the companies were ! cooperating. j Inspectors appointed under the Com- panies Act, as sought by Mr. Mallam, S have power to call witnesses and hear | evidence under oath. ' . j In his reply Mr. Mallam angrily ac j cused the Attorney-General of protect- I ing M.L.C. but withdrew this later at I direction of the Speaker. g Mr. Mallam's motion, after the Gov- J ernment had gagged the debate, was j defeated 46 to 42. g
