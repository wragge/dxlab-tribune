 [?] A BOVE: Some of the 35 electri cians and electrical assistants employed by the electrical con tracting firm of Matthew Hall, who threw victory signs as they left Sydney Trades Hall last Friday, after getting five of their work mates reinstated. In what was described by the men as a flagrant case of victimisation, the firm had given dismissal notices to the five men, including the job union delegate, on the previous Wednesday, while employing other labor on the Monday and Thursday. The men from the firm's three job sites (Carlton Centre, Elizabeth Street; Ocean House, Martin Place; and the Bank of Adelaide building, George Street) held a stop-work meeting at Hyde Park on the Thurs day, where it was decided to take strike action until the five men were reinstated.
