 r Welcome lift in I weekly tally j By JUNE MILLS Good news for the Fund this week, with two large donations — one of £25 and one of £10. "THE £25 is a donation from a fairly new donor, all the more pleasing as it comes from outside Sydney, from Moree. My old friend Wally Coles donated the £10 as a Christmas present for Tribune. Wally has been making donations like this for many a long day. "Alf of -Mascot" gave his donation of £1 to Popular Tribune seller Dave Legge with the comment, "It isn't the first quid and it won't be the last." Thanks, Alf. . We look forward to hearing more from you. Last week I mentioned Bill Porter and his long association with various trade unions. This week Bill has paid, in £1 received from his old friend George, who worked at Garden Island with Bill. We hope that more donations will be sent to Bill Porter for the Tribune Fund. Butch Wharton sent down £1 re ceived in small donations at his Tribune stand in Hunter Street, Newcastle. " Butch asks that we say thanks to all the donors and says no amount is too small or too big for him -to accept. Last but by no means least another £1 from Jacob Johnson, all the way from West Australia, sent with good wishes and success for the Tribune "Fund.
