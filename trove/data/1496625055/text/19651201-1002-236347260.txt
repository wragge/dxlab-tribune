 DLP play on judges' pay ANBERRA: The two Sen ators of the Democratic Labor Party went through the motions of a 50-50 split last week, in the vote on the Bill to increase salaries of senior Federal Judges. The Labor Party opposed the bill, which gives the judges rises of £1500 to £2000, being roughly 20- per cent of the respective salaries.

"This is one law for the workers and another for the tall poppies," Mr. O'Brien 'said.
