 I The magnetism of WA's export iron |BHP wants to I be in It, too | Seventeenth cen- ! tury navigators were ! fearful of a mysterious at- I traction supposed to be | exerted on ships by a lode- | stone" which drew them to | their doom on Australia's | | porth-west coast. j | True. ..or .not' then, today .the ! | magnetic pull of profits from S iron ore exports is felt thousands | of miles away — in New. York, | London, Tokio, as well as in Syd- | ney and Melbourne. I Conzinc-Rio Tinto, Kaiser Steel, j Utah Construction, Cleveland- Cliffs, Mitsui, Colonial Sugar . | I Refinery and other giant concerns j have practically taken possession j I of the 15,000 million tons of high | I grade ore in W.A., building rail- j | ways, ports, roads and townships, ! | to export our raw material to j g feed Japan's rapidly growing j i steel industry. ! I So far excluded from this | 1 lucrative trade is Australia's bipr- i | gest monopoly, Broken Hill Pty., j 2 which mines the Yampi Sound j I islands for its blast furnaces in j | Newcastle and Kembl'a. ; | Legislation is now before tne i W A, Parliament to permit B.H.P ; I to .share in this profitable export trade. I It the legisla:toh is passed. I J Mr. Tonkin said, the royalty pay j | able on Yampi ore should be in j creased from the present 1/6 a j | ton to at least £1. Even at a con I I servative estimate, B.H.P prolit ; ! on, a million tons a year would 1 be £2 h million on top of the £19 ! million the company made in 1964-65.
