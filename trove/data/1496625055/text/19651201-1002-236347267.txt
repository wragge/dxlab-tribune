 Salary grab AB_ a V.I.P. (very impoverished pensioner) I raise my voice in protest against the latest pro posed salary grab by those very avaricious parliamentarians. The single pensioner receives the munificent sum of £364 per year and now we have politicians not satisfied with their last increase of £500 proposing a further £700 a year. The scrooge-like attitude of the Government is shown by the state ment of the Federal Treasurer who said, "There is no guarantee that pensioners will get £1 bonus at Christmas."
