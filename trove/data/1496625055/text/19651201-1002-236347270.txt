 Facts on the North-West 'jpKIBUNE (November 10) car ried an article on the confer ence to plan the development of trade union organisation in the north west of West Australia. In this article serious mistakes were made. Some included: (1) The "foreign interest will . grab about £2,000 mUlion in j profits" from an investment j of £300 million. In fact the gross amount the exporters are due -to receive over the next 22 years is in the vicinity of £1,200 million, out of which all wages and other expenses, includ ing royalties must be met. A brochure issued by Ian Pot ter & Co. for investors estimates that profits will amount to £100 million after repayment of capi tal, taxation, royalties and running costs. (2) "Royalties will be as little as 1/- a ton." The bulk of the ore exported will be crude, on which approxi mately 6/- a ton is payable. Royalty on pellitised ore will be about half that amount. The fact is that the main bene ficiaries are the Japanese steel ' makers, who are getting the ore at bargain prices. S. Aarons, Perth (W.A.).
