 [?] A useful TV shock on poverty in Australia MANY viewers of Channel 2 Four Corners last Saturday night would have received a rude shock- to learn that so much poverty exists in Aus tralia. It is true that many Australian families today have- more modern conveniences that hitherto. There are more cars, refrigerav tors, TV sets, washing machines. Many families own their homes and- many enjoy a- high standard of living. "The Other Australians" part of ABN 2 - Four Corners last week-end showed another side of the picture. It pointed out. that 750,000 people exist in sub-standard conditions and on a- sub-standard scale of nut rition— most families under £20 a week. There is no doubt that part of the- cause of this poverty is the high cost of living which inflicts: great burdens on people, even those &lt; with fairly good incomes: When couples have to live- on old age or invalid pensions, those on fixed incomes from superan nuation, the struggle to buy neces sities becomes very hard. Add to this the high rents, pay ing off a heme, cost of travel and we see that- there is less for food, particularly; if families are paying hire purchase for cars, fridges and other goods. Another cause of hardship for the average family is the recent in crease in doctors' fees and' dentists' fees. Most health schemes do not cover - dentists at all and- the Federal Government did- not in crease its payments to cover the increase in doctors' fees. "The Other Australians" showed that there is. a great- gulf between the 750,000 people- who live in poverty and those who enjoy a comfortable standard of living. The ABG is to be- congratulated on this revealing and realistic ven ture, following its screening of the controversial documentary on Syd ney's poverty-stricken inner suburbs, titled "The Fringe-Dwellers". Incidentally the ABC interviewer seemed to have a more positive approach than the two MP's who appeared. ' M.J. (North Sydney).
