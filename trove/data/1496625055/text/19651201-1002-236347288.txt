 j SA "children" j j have grown up i i i j | jDELAIPE: South Aus- | tralia's overwhelming | vote in favor of a State 2 Lottery was a severe blow | to those who, like Liberal . I Party Opposition Leader I (Sir Thomas Playford) | suppressed free and popu- I lar expression on such soc- | ial questions for many | years. j Playford had insultingly said | that to ask electors whether they | favored a lottery was like "put- | ting poison into the hands of | children." 8 One cannot help but agree with _ ALP -Deputy Speaker (Mr. S. | Lawn) when he commented: | "I hope the referendum will j help him (Playford) realise that 1 the children have grown up and | want more progress made with | social questions. | , "The YES vote shows Sir i Thomas Playford was out of line ,with feeling of nis own elector- ) /ate and the State as a whjole." j ' Playford 's own electorate sup- ported a lottery, as did every j other electorate with the excep- j tion of a narrow NO vote in j Angas. | At time of writing, the overall = figures were: YES 320,233, NO 1 131,304, informal 34,941. | Under the' Playford admini- : stration, the SA people were S deprived of democratic expres- $ sion in the lottery issue. The j ALP, when elected to power, = ; had a referendum on its pro- | gram. j With the ALP carrying out its | policy and the electoral gerry- | ' rnander having no effect on the j voting, the people were able to | have their say, and did so in no i uncertam manner. j In a sense, then, the vote j expressed confidence in the new I Government and is a blow at j the old order of things!-. j s
