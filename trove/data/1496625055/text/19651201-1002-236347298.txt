 [?] | Benefit seen in j i soccer defeat j By "THE CHALLENGER" | I Probably not too many sport enthusiasts expected Aus- I I j tralia's first venture into the World Cup Soccer competition f I j to be very spectacular, but no doubt many were surprised f I J at the devastating way the Democratic People's Republic of ! \ | ( North ) Korea team beat us. . I I "THE first game turned j out to be what was | described by some as a | "thrashing". In their 6-1 | win, the Koreans proved s to be too fast and clever. | About the only consolation I for the Australians— and a valid one at that— is that the game | was played in humid, oppressive heat, with the temperature read- | ing reported to be in the nine- I ties. j In the second match the Aus- I tralian team fared a little better j in that the final score was only j 3-1 in the Koreans' favor. | Five changes were made in' I the team and the changed tac- j tics, by the Australian coach j Tiko ' Yelisavicic, was reported j to have helped considerably. ( Tiko Yelisavicic, commenting . j on the Koreans' win, said that | they were in world class and I could go well in the finals to be I played in England. ! Despite the defeats of the Aus- j tralian team,, they will show j much improvement from the . j experience gained. The win is indeed a fine I achievement for the Democratic j Peoples' Republic of Korea, a j socialist country which only a ! dozen years ago was fighting a | war against South Korea and j ' foreign interventionist armies j led by the;; USA. v ' I Cricket I jQESPITE what is considered j to be. a high rate of scoring j —runs averaging about one a minute— and the highly colorful I coverage handed to it by press, | TV and radio, cricket, it would | seem, is struggling for survival. Crowds attending the present ! I international matches between | ! the State teams and the MCC I I are by almost any comparison j \ very poor in numbers. ! jj - The ABC television program, j Four Corners, last weekend pro- j vided a number of answers to \ the problem of cricket's decline 1 by interviewing those who should s be mostly concerned with the | game— the sporting youth and | the cricketing experts. The not- I so-expert also had a say. ! Some of the comments were: ! - A number of schoolboys inter- j | viewed in a bowling alley: "The j j game is too slow"; "There's j j not enough all-round participa- ! tion"; "If it were run on the I \ same lines as football maybe it j | would, be more interesting"; j | "It's all right if you're either jjj batting or bowling." j | Frank Browne, journalist, said j | that the game was good' but was | f surrounded by a lot of mumbo 1 | jumbo. I| To the rescue of the game j 1 came the English cricketing g 1 newspaper correspondent, Mr. ! I E. W. Swanton, who provided j statistics and other information 1 I from Alan Barnes, of the Cricket g I ing Control Board and the secre- 11 tary of the N.S.W. Cricket Asso- t ciatiori. i Mr. Swanton said that the j number of people who played | cricket was on the up and up j and that he believed that cricket j . is more popular in Australia j now than it ever was. j Indeed, one bright feature of j the present series of games is ! the number of young players who I are standing out as very good | | prospects and who might serve j fl to draw the crowds and revive . fl interest. . ! fl „ Chief among them is the 19-. year-old Doug Walters, who since j g his first innings score of 129 in. j j the NSW match against the | j MCC team- has been hailed as | j another Don Bradman. j The Rock j S "DOCKY GATTELLARI by the I I time he enters the ring for j j hi, s world title bput on Thursday g g will have amassed enough advice = j on just what he should do and | | have done, to leave him— if he j j takes any notice of it— very much j ! confused. ? I Gattellari has had pointed out I j to him that he has not been J ! impressive enough in the gym; g that he has stopped training too | soon; that he hasn't had enough j i variety in his sparring and that j j he seems to tire too easily tr j ! a world would-be champ. j fl j Enough scope has been covered j B g to leave room for the most j B S backward "expert" to come m , B I later with "I told you so." IB | However, such advice usually j B g costs very little — and that s > b | about what it's worth. One thing B | for certain is that the "Rock | B iwhen he climbs through the j h ropes on Thursday will be o B his own and, apart from hi B S trainer's words between rounds, g j will certainly have to wor flj ! things out for himself.
