 ITHAR'S GOLD IN IHEM MINES " i There s gold in the hills but gold also in the hearts of the South Coast miners. JUST last week Communist Party members working at iNebo colliery held a barbecue for Tribune, where £25 was collected. They were expres sing appreciation of the full re port given about the Bulli mine disaster. Many Tribunes are sold by these Communist members on the job, in the pubs and the streets. They wish particularly to express appreciation of the good attendance at the barbecue, even though the weather was not very good. Our old friend L.R. called last week to give her usual £10 donation to the Fund. Election day donations to Tribune Fund include £1 paid, to M. Grant by Fred Burraston Gear in the Can terbury municipality and £1 from D.P.C. (Balmain). Bill Porter has received another £1 donation following the appeal he made through this column recently. This time the donation comes from a member of the Building Workers Union, an old-time workmate of BUl's. As there is only two more issues of Tribune before the end of this year, let's have a really big response to our Christmas appeal from all old and new friends.
