At most sessions there | | were priests in the audience and 1 j special greetings from the Arch- I f bishop of the Greek Orthodox I I Church. j J The discussion was on a very j I theoretical and theological level. | Professor Fassbinder said that ! f the main obstacle to peace was | I ignorance; and this bred mistrust, j |j War today presupposes nuclear war— and horror weapons would I / :hot differentiate between Catholics j j and Communists. I 1 Dr. Frederici, an ex MP of the j t . Christian Democrats, advanced the I | j ideas that children must be educat- I e- ed ; for peace and that education | | , for . peace must be active. Some I ; people oppose war but are not j | active workers for peace. One can j | only be an active worker for peace f | if orie is in tune with God. God's I | love is essential. An individual who j | does not believe in God cannot be = fe: a worker for peace. if; These ideas were sharply chal- ! f lenged by Madam Laura Diaz, a | | Communist deputy in ' the Italian | | Parliament, who insisted that she j | had and did work consistently foi I | peace and yet she was not religi- J | ous. I I Madam Zarri presented the idea J | that fighting strengthened the in- j 8 dividual — thus war could strength- j | en and purify the nation. This j I paper was very vigorously debated ) I :and the ideas in it challenged by i j many women including Catholics. I p Joint action j | The report from Australia on j ft women's action against the war in j | Vietnam, the development of such I | groups as S.O.S.; .the action taken j against war toys, etc., was wel- | | ccmed. Delegates from many j | countries arranged for joint in- j ternational action and the ex- j | change of experiences in tl.e , ? | futi'-e. ! 1 This conference was indicative ol j g the extension of the dialogue that j is developing. It holds many jes- . | sons for Communists, Catholics | and peace workers generally j » It is becoming more and more , m obvious that many very sincere | 3 : people are coming to the Pfa®e | n ! movement and to peace activity = h I and action But they will do so in | jf I their own way. Prayers for peace j u are still regarded by some as trie j a I only way. Others - advance the idea j i I that while God provides the origin- | I ; al concept, this must be develope. i 1 I by man . and it needs courage an , | determination for man to do Gna - j H j work for peace. . IS ! "Professor Fassbinder noted mat as j the late Pope John had said th g| | the original concept of Pacem | p !. Terris was God's answer to w m i prayers, but" it- needed, his ait i || j and his work and that finally 1 t I ffi "seed came to fruition and on , | m ! 'ideas flowered and gave hope > | j the world".
