 Equal pay tussle in WA OERTH. â€” A decision last week by the State Industrial Commission in a test case on equal pay handed back to the State Liberal Govcrn- " ment the onus of deciding the nuestion. The Government is now trying to shuffle this unwanted responsibility back to the Industrial Commission.' The Government has consistently maintained that the matter of equal pay is a matter for the Industrial Commission to determine and not a ' responsibility of the Government. In an: attempt to prevent further buckpassing and pin down responsi bility, the Miscellaneous Workers' Union, in consultation with and with the authority of the Trades and Labor . Council, in September applied to' the Industrial Commission for equal pay in the dairy products industry. The application was refused and the iVl.W.U d PI J cell piUVlUUU. LIlc Udoib Ui the test case. The Commission on December 1 un animously dismissed the appeal. The decision made it clear that unless the law-jelating to the basic wage is amended, attempts to achieve a universal application of equal pay between men and women in this State would fail. Now is it clear that it is the Gov- ernment's duty to legislate for equal pay for equal work, by amendment of the State Arbitration Act.
