 Nature's SOS ipwÂ© members of the peewits' Save Our Sons organisation, raising a family in the top branches of our camphor laurel, have, by savage dive-bombing raids, scared from our garden all visitors not wanted by them, in- eluding to date one kookaburra and three cats. We ourselves are just tolerated in return for frequent offerings of cheese. When humans show as much mili tancy in protecting their nestlings from the gilt-spurred roosters' en croachments, there will be fewer wars in the world. W.A.W. (Mosman).
