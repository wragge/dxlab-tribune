 "Miracle" film criticised "TTHE RUSSIAN MIRACLE" screened recently at the Sydney Union Theatre was a disappoint ment, though it contained some very effective material. In the first part of the film we see Yuri Gagarin, the first spaceman, against the background of a coun try 300 years behind the times; films of the Czar and his family holiday ing, at receptions in all their splen dour -pictures of the Czar's diary which recorded the dishes he had eaten, how he had enjoyed them, how often he had slept late. This was contrasted with the semi- starved peasants and workers, the former actually filmed eating their own thatched roofs in times of famine. Then back to Gagarin, the first man to reach outside the earth. All this was powerful stuff, this was part of the "miracle". Magnificent pictures of the armies of intervention, the great British, French, American and German mono polists who created these armies . . . These lords of capitalism at their champagne breakfast drooling over the mighty Russian empire which they thought was literally lay ing at their feet , , Pictures or me ragged, hungry and for most part bootless Red Army mobilising and then throwing out these ! vast armies along with their rich creators. ' All this was mighty. What then was wrong? The- ponderous, humourless com mentary, the agonisingly slow pace, The film should have been cut by half... We were taken back to the same old slushy street in Siberia many times, to ensure that we had the contrast with modern Siberia. There was a long a repetitious ac count of a leading physicist and his parents. Let's hope this film will be re made without hammering the les sons, without the heavy propa ganda.
