 FULL VIRUS CYCLE PHOTOGRAPHED I pHE development of a virus in the nucleus of a cell, from the moment of entry to the stage when the cell was completely destroyed; has been phopographed at the Kirchenstein Institue of M'cro- biology in Latvia. The experiment lasted for a whole year and direct observations of a! stages of the virus-cell interaction were conducted for 120 hours. About a hundred micro-photographs were obtained.
