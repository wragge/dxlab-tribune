 rail unions CYDNEY: Recent trade union elections have brought changes in the lead- - ing bodies of two rain unions n New South Wales. In the Australian Railways Union (ARU) militant forces have strength ened their position on that union's NSW State Council. The results of this election are con sidered to reflect the desires of ARU members for a stronger stand by the union on wages and other questions affecting members' welfare. The NSW Division of the Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Eh- ginemen (AFULE) also has some new leaders. These include the President, Vice- President, Manager and Assistant Manager. These two latter positions are the equivalent of the State Sec retary and Asst. Secretary in other unions. These four and several others who supported them sought election, on the grounds of a stronger stand by the union t issues affecting the mem bers' welfare and increased rank and, file control in the union. AFULE members consider they were badly treated in the settlement of the recent. NSW Government Transport increment campaign and the earlier industry allowance settlement. Mr. B. Willingale, who led a cam paign for a stronger stand by the union and increased rank and file control, was elected by a large major- . :ity to the position of Divisional Man ager and NSW representative on the union's Federal governing body.
