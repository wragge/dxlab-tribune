 XMAS GIFTS I FOR TRIBUNE By JUNE MILLS Many fine donations from old and new friends this week have assisted Tribune Fund; another big effort could bring us close to £3500, which would ' be the best total for years. 0F outstanding note is Bill | Dye's donation from Kog- arah Hotel stand. Bill told me he d had a bit of luck about this donation. From our old friend Eberhardt in Queensland we received £2/5/0 donation with this cheerful note: "I value Tribune very much, it is a good and honest paper. Having been a Workers Weekly reader and seller and an old "share holder" in Trib une in my book you still take the biscuit. Jock Kilburn, known to so many for his trade union activities over the years and his letters to Tribune, sent a donation of £1 and writes: "We are approaching the season of peace and good will. To our eternal shame we are assisting in the des- truction of homes in Vietnam, de stroying the people's crops and de vastating their land, while here in Australia we do little to limit the dire effect of bushfires, drought, floods and soil erosion.
