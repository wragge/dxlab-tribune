 A war of deceit "yHE Vietnam was has greatly stimulated the American econ omy with Government spending on armament and in associated in- dustries had filtered through and benefited the whole business sec tion", according to Mr. Walter Hill, secretary general of the Interna tional Chamber of Commerce, Daily Mirror, October 21. The Readers Digest of August 1962 said: "To protect investments worth 2,000 million U.S. dollars is the reason why American forces are stationed in Vietnam". To create the spectre of a militant aggressor is a political trick as old as Julius Ceasar, and to suggest we are in Vietnam to halt Communist aggression is the shabbiest form of deceit. This war for liberation has been conducted for over 20 years by the Vietnamese people against various foreign exploiters and every honest Australian should protest to the Fed eral Government to demand with drawal of our troons.
