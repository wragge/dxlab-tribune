 "Tribute" to Stephenson ¥ WAS sorry to see in the excel- lent Spring issue of "The Real ist" a tribute to the late P. R. Stephensen. witn a ii respect to me winex vi the tribute he seems to have forgot ten what I and many others will never forget: how, when we were struggling to arouse Australians to the horrors and the dangers of fascism, Stephensen not only excus ed- it, as ordinary reactionaries did, but actually carried its filthy prop aganda in his paper, The Publicist. Stephensen did this when the Jap- t anese militarists were murdering I and torturing innocent Chinese by g the million, and getting ready to do | the same to innocent Australians. s A man may be mistaken, of course, j but an honest man will admit a S mistake. | Did Stephensen ever admit he was | mistaken about fascism and apolo- j gise for his slanders on the anti- j fascists? Did he ever acknowledge, even I after the Nuremburg trials and the j Japanese war criminal trials that what the Communists had been say- I ing was right and what he and his j fascist "Australia First" movement ; had been saying was a pack of lies? The writer in The Realist, is of j course, entitled to his views. But so ! far as I am concerned a thousand I speeches in defence of Lady Chat- j terley's Lover, such as Stephensen &lt; was apparently making when he died, will not excuse one speech in praise of the fascist genocides. — W.
