 r Now is time for j overseas ships I SYDNEY : A national trade union leader this week said I an opportunity had come for a decisive Australian Govern ment move into the overseas shipping trade that could help relieve the dangerous drain on the overseas balance of pay ments. HE is Mr. J. Bevan, national secretary of the newly merged Boilermakers and lack- smiths' Society. Mr. Bevan's statement followed a series of moves that reveal a scramble by overseas capital to cut in on the big potential in carriage overseas of Australian ores and coal, and at the same time moves by Australian capital and possibly the Federal I Government. Contracts to ship iron ore to Japan from the North-West are the biggest prize being sought. One report sug gests a partnership between R. W. Miller and Japanese capital is Jn the making, using Japan-built ships for this trade. Another says the Broken Hill Pty. has plans to run its ore carriers overseas. Mr. Bevan commented on this: "If Miller wants to break into the iron ore trade he should also be required to have ships built in Australia, not Japan," he said. McEwen speaks Mr. Bevan said the policy of the trade union movement is, that the ANL should handle Australia's coastal and overseas trade— that these ships be built in Australia and manned by Australian seamen. Mr. Bevan said his union wel- 3omed a statement at the weekend by the Minister for Trade (Mr. McEwen) that Australia should develop its own shipping line to trade overseas. / Quoting a statement by the Minister that £250 m. is drained from Aus tralia's trade balances each year in the form of freight and handling charges to overseas interests, he said: "These are mainly shipping mono polies which continue to charge us the maximum the trade can bear."
