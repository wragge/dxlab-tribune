 ! 'Jochen 9 and\ i no doubt j about it! j 2k GERMAN Y outh Art j Prize attracted 290 r j works entered by 112 | j young artists. Eleven jur- z | ors out or l D gave prefer- j ence to a sculpture con- j sisting of round objects of J bronze and steel made by j one Jochen Hiltmann. I j "What it represented is diffi- cult to say, but then, that I I was not important. The Italian j i name of the. sculpture — "Ster- j ; co d'elephante"— sounded ! poetic and intriguing. j One of the jurymen Dr. Die- I j ter Honisch, the well-known art j | critic, archeologist, philosopher j j and director of the Wurttem- | j berg Art Society, wrote: I | "Hiltmann' .. has entered I I 'spheres', deformed as a result | of internal tension and exter- i nal impact. They burst; crack | | and reveal to space the hither- g | to intact body. The body and I | space in them merge to form i I a single whole." I 1 Hiltmann was awarded the t I 10,000 piark prize. At the pre- j I sentation ceremony, attended ! | by the Stuttgart city fathers j ! and other guests of honour, an- i J other art critic, Dr. Ulrich I 1 Gertz, delivered a learned re- j 2 port on modern German sculp- j ! ture, on the importance of j | understanding the idea behind I | a work of art. j j Unfortunately, one or the re- j 2 porters covering the event de- j S cided to find out what the name I I of the prize sculpture meant i | and took a peep into a diction- . j ary. | He could hardly believe his j j eyes when he saw "stereo j j d'elephante" was "elephant I | dung"! j 1 Before breaking the story, he j | telephoned the Italian Consul- j 2 ate and checked upon the trans- » J lation of these euphonious J I words. It proved to be correct, j After that he asked the man j | tending the elephant at the lo- j i cal circus to take a look at the j I prize-winning sculpture. j | This specialist confirmed its j ! resemblance to the original. j I!
