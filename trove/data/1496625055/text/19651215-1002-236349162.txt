 I "Che's" goodbye 1 j "Fidel: R Fidel Castro, at a recent meeting in Havana to announce the 1 M I naming of the Communist Party of Cuba, and the presentation of its 1 11 | first Central Committee, referred to the departure from Cuba of his 1 'W I well-known 'leading comrade-in-arms, Ernesto "Che' Guevara. fi M' | ' He then read the following letter, signed by Guevara in Havana I II I on April 1, 1965: I '%$ S At this moment I remem- 1 ber many things â€” when I | met you in Maria Antonia's | house, when you suggested | my coming, all the tensions I involved in the preparations. One day they asked who should be notified in case of ! death, and the real possibility of | that fact affected all. Later we knew that it was true, that in I revolution one wins or dies (if f it is a real one). Many comrades | fell along the way to victory. ! Today everything is less dra- I matic because we are more mature. | But the fact is repeated. I feel | that I have fulfilled the part of \ my duty that tied me to the | Cuban revolution in its territory, | and I say goodbye to you, the | Comrades, your people, who are I already mine. | I formally renounce my posi- | tions in the National Leadership i of the Party, my post as Minister, f my rank as Major, and my Cu- | ban citizenship. Nothing legal s binds me to Cuba. The only ties i are of another nature; those | which cannot be broken as ap- | pointments can. s Recalling my past life, I believe ! I have worked with sufficient | honor and dedication to con- | solidate the revolutionary tri- !c umph. My only serious failing was not having confided more in you from the first moments in I the Sierra Maestra, and not hav- i ing understood quickly enough I your qualities as a leader and a I revolutionary. I I have lived magnificent days j and X felt at your side the pride | .of belonging to our people in the 8C brilliant yet sad days of the Caribbean Crisis. I Few times has a statesman | been more brilliant than you. in s those days. I am also proud of 1 having followed you without I hesitation, identifying with your !way of thinking and of apprais ing dangeris and principles. | Other nations of the world call for my modest efforts. I can do ! that which is denied you. because S of your responsibility at the fi head of Cuba, and the time has icome for us to part. I want it known that I do it | with mixed feelings of joy and | sorrow; I leave here the purest J of my hopes as a builder, a-nd the I dearest of those I love. And I I leave a people that received me | as a son. That wounds me deeply. I I carry to new battle fronts the faith that you taught me, the I revolutionary spirit of my people, f the feeling of fulfilling the most | sacred of duties: to fight against g imperialism wherever I may be. i This -comforts and heals the | deepest of wounds. | I state once more that I free g Cuba from any responsibility; ex- cept that which stems from its fi example. If my final hour finds | me under other skies, my last | thought will be of this people and 1 especially of you. f I am thankful for your teach- j ing, your example, and I will try ! to be faithful to the final conee- fi quences of my acts. | I have always been identified | with the foreign policy of our | Revolution, and I will continue to g be. Wherever I am, I will feel the | responsibility of being a Cuban 1 revolutionary, and as such I shall I behave. | I am not sorry that I leave my g children and my wife nothing 1 material. I am happy it is that | way. I ask nothing for them, as g I know the State will provide | enough for their expenses and | education. I I would like to say much to you g and our people, but I feel it is I not necessary. Words cannot ex- | press what I would want them to, i and I don't think it's worth while g to banter phrases. | Ever onward to victory 1 Home- J land or' death! I embrace you with all my g revolutionary fervor." 1 CHE. Ernesto "Che" Guevara I
