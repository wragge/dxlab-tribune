 MJAJiS Ma-Thi-Chu | LUNCHED with Ma-Thi- Chu and her lovely compan ion, Nguyen-Ngoc-Dung. Slim, saa-eyea ma- 1 ni-vnu was irom Saigon. She is 42. Her life has known only colonial op pression and imperialist agr .gression. One midnight of April 1957 whilst sleeping she and her two and a hah year old daughter were arrested. Her crime was participation m the move ment against fascism and for a democratic united Vietnam. , Without trial she was imprisoned lor twelve months. With other wom- en prisoners she was beaten with electrically heated rods and sub jected to daily torture. He little daughter was told to behave and xeep quiet or ner motner ana otner women prisoners would continue to be beaten. Today, seven . years later, night mares continue to disturb the little girl's sleep. Upon her release Ma-Thi-Chu fled with her family to the liberated areas of south Vietnam. She said: "It is a real fact— a real fact— . that we can continue as long as necessary. Four fifths of our coun try is liberated and we have our own economy and grow our own rice and life is much better for us." Each of the four women delegates from south Vietnam . has suffered torture, imprisonment, separation from children and husband. I asked Ma-Thi-Chu why was it that the leader of their delegation Nguyen-Thi-Binh sometimes twitch ed her shoulders and walked very stealthily? Nguyen-Thi-BInh, 38 years old, mother of two children whom she had not seen for a long time, had suffered bad injuries to her back from torture whilst three years in prison.
