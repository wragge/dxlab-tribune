 wwwwvvvnvw In strafe with the press A violent attack on the press and journalists last Thursday . by Premier Askin has created serious difficulties in the Govern ment parties. The attack followed a question in the Lower House relating to an article by the financial editor of the Syd ney Morning Herald. The article cri ticised the Government for its lack of action over a report into the af fairs of Collier Moat and associated companies. Premier Askin, who also holds the post of Treasurer, staggered M.L.A.S when he said he was not very inter ested in what financial editors wrote. "One never knows whether they are bona fide or whether they have some financial axe to grind." He finished by saying: "There is one thing we are all sure of — irrespective of which side of the House we are on—and that is if poli- cians might not be in very good odor, there is one institution which ranks very much below us, and that is the press. M.L.A.S from all parties were stun ned by the Premier's remarks; one Government backbencher later told pressmen that on hearing it he had. nearly fell off his chair. Members of the press gallery replied to the attack on the same day at a specially convened meeting, where it was decided to boycott the Xmas press party arranged by the Premier and Cabinet for 5 p.m. that day. All Cabinet Ministers were notified that the action of the Press Gallery was not directed at them. A group of Government members at tempted to get the Premier to apol ogise to the pressmen on the floor of the House, but no apology was made. Later, a number of Government, members privately disassociated them selves to members of the gallery from the Premier's remarks. It is certain that the matter will be discussed at the first meeting of Cab inet, and there are also indications that he will also have to explain his actions to Ash St., which is the head quarters of the Liberal Party.
