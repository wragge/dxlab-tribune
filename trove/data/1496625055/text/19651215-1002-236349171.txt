 Demonstrators fined gYDNEY: Another 14 of ; over 50 people arrested during the Vietnam war pro- : test demonstration on Octo- ber 22 were fined Â£10 on i Monday for "obstructing . the free passage of a vehicle". The defendants pleaded guilty in Central Court. . : One of them, Dr. J. Childs, a Uni versity economic iecturer, said in ; evidence that he took -part in the demonstration because it was neces sary to bring to public notice that many people were profoundly con cerned with Government policy on Vietnam. At the same time, the main media of mass communication,, particularly TV and radio, were virtually closed to citizens for : such purposes. Mr. J. Staples, in defence, argued that his clients were public men who had tried to express a viewpoint about a vital public issue, the Vietnam war in the only way available to them. Mr./ Staples argued that when Par liament had provided the power lor the enforcing of traffic regulations, it did. not intend it as a means of ob structing the right of any individual citizen to make public a viewpoint on vital issues. The Magistrate (Mr. Teece) dis agreed with Mr. Staples that the demonstrators had had no intention of causing a breach of traffic regula tions. It was true, he said that each individual was entitled to his own point iof view and the right to express these- views without, breaching the law. I
