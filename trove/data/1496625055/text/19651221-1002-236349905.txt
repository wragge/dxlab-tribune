 Poker machines UMIIHI— IIIBIHIBIIIinM— J|R- GRIFFIN, Retail Trades Secretary, blames poker mac hines for business difficulties. Whatever effect playing of poker machines may have on the popula tion at large it is noteworthy that the retailers' representative did not trot out "low wages" as one of the reasons. Strangely, Myers, D. Jones, Grace Bros., Coles, Woolworths and a few others made record profits running into many millions this year. I add my condolences for the "poor" business men. Bill Denchfield, Warragamba (NSW).
