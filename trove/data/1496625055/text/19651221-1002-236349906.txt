 [?] [?] "THE reaction of sections of the Sydney press and TY to the great anti- Vietnam war demonstration was warmlv tol- erant, which must reflect their knowledge of the public atti tude. In the demonstration itself there were hundreds of young students and apprentices and a large number of women in the 30-40 age group. One woman was hearing a little placard neatly written in red and blue, "Bring back my Boy." The participants were mainly Australian. The police appeared to be under- . standing, and some older ones had sympathetic expressions of approval. There were a few hecklers, but no marked hostility. I spoke to a dozen or more bystanders and they were a . cross section of Australian life: A housewife said she didn't know much about it. © Three sailors from the RAN seemed agreed "that it wasn't their blue— see the poeple in Canberra." A GPO man said when handed the leaflet, "All right, I'll read it, but you can't do much about it." An apprentice: "The war's no good to me or my trade— my boss wants me to stay at the bench." A A npsfc exterminator: "It's no joke these wars, but thinking people are getting sick of them." The main features of this demon stration were thev young people and the new faces. "Once I knew every one by their Christian names," said an old-timer who had the courage to openly tell the world what he thought. F. Wills, Sydney (NSW).
