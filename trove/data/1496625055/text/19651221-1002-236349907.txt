 Way out of Vietnam T17E should set an example to the U.S. government and with draw our armed forces immedia tely. A careful study of our daily press over the years makes it abundantly clear that the U.S.A. and her client states had no right to interfere in the first place. Despite enormous foreign cash and logistic support — culminating in a massive military, air and naval invasion — not one of the many so-called "governments" in Saigon over the last decade has enjoyed popular approval. And how could they when each in turn has been made up of in triguing, power-hungry individua lists, anxious to feather their own nests ere they are turn were over thrown at the point of a gun by the next lot? So far as the National Liberation Front is concerned, it is surely clear that the peasants driven to desperation by ruthless exploitation we were forced to take up whatever. primitive arms they could devise and fight for their existence. The N.LJF. now has well trained regular and guerilla forces at its disposal. The U.S.A.-Saigon armies are to all intents and purposes confined to a few cities and heavily forti fied bases and must depend on air or sea transport to move from place to place. When, backed by massive air cover, these armies do sweep through the countryside, their poorly armed opponents — informed of every move — retreat, only to return, when their enemy has re turned to base. The N.L.F. has the overwhelming support of the people and the Wash ington-Saigon axis practically none. u. u. israbazon, Boronia (Vic.).
