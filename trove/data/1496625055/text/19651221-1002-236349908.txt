 A plain case of BBBlBHBBBgBBOnHBBHDBIBn brain-washing jPHE sending of pamphlets by the. Federal Government to secondary schools setting out the Government's case for support of American action in Vietnam is a blatant attempt to indoctrinate children of impressionable age to its own point of view on a contro versial issue. Surely this is opportunism and is against all precedents by an Austra lian Government? This is made manifest by the fact that State Edu cation Ministers were not asked for their permission for the pamphlet to be sent to schools. Also supporting this view is the fact that the Leader of the Opposi tion, Mr. Calwell, representing ap proximately half the Australian elec tors, was refused a request made to Sir Robert Menzies, to publish and distribute speeches made by the Op position on the Vietnam war, which were opposed to the Government's policy. This departure by the Federal Gov ernment from the principle on which democracy is based, in my view, on the Government's reason for reject- ing the recommendation of the Mar tin Report for improving the stand ard of education in teacher training. The Government's unprecedented action suggests a better educated community in a sophisticated sense is not what it envisages for the future; but rather, one which has been moulded to accept its own particular point of view. History has shown that mere opin- . ion, when based solely on political expediency, can become an extreme ly barbarous yardstick by which to evaluate the lives and rights of mil lions of human beings. The consequence which arose in the past because of people's indif ference in allowing this type of circumstance to become a dominant factor in their way of life is till too vivid in the minds of those who remember the horror camps of nazi Germany to be taken lightly.
