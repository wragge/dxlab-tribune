 | An introduction j S to Psychology | 1 SOVIET Puhl i s K i n g | houses in recent years I have produced some ex- I ceedingly fine books on J scientific subjects written !in a popular style which can be understood by high school students or work ers with only a primary | education. 2 One of the best has just ap ! peared with the rather obscure I title of "Psychology AS YOU I MAY LIKE IT". I This is not' a text book of I psychology, nor does it claim to | be a popularisation of the sub- | ject although it could well do I so. j In a foreword to the book I these questions are asked:â€” | "Is there anyone in our | days who may not wonder what the people of the coming com munist society will have to be like? ! . Or may not care how to develop the will, memory and attention? Or may not want to know | what conscience, duty and love g are from the standpoint of psy- 2 chology? | Or may not be interested I in whether telepathy is possible, | whether or not dogs and ants g have consciousness; what are | dreams, and so on and so forth?' | This gives some idea of the | scope of this fascinating book. g In the greatly increased atten- I tion to Marxist philosophy shown I recently one of the side effects i has been the number of questions | asked about the working of the | human brain, the scope and in g tricacy of human consciousness 2 the distortions of reality often | transmitted by the senses and sc g on. i Much light is thrown on these I subjects in this book, which is I well translated and most easj to read. g E.
