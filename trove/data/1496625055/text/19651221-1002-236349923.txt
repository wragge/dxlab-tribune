 [?] I : 1965 ! ;As this is the last issue of Tribune for 1965, we have ! |: replaced our editorial with statements by prominent per- j | sonalities on what they thought were significant develop- j I ments of the year. j ! MR. G. ANDERSON ( As- | sociation for International Co-operation and Disarma- | ment): I "One of the most signi- | ficant developm e n t s of j: 1965 has been the dramatic j emergence of the peace | movement in the western j world as a serious potential j threat to the policies of mili- ! tary intervention in Viet- ! nam. The anti-war move- Iment, notably in the USA, |i and also in Australia, is j significantly broadening and . j deepening its dimensions. ' | "It is at the same time | developing a formidable de- | termination and capacity for I effective political action, t Hlf the present pattern of j escalation contin u e s in j Vietnam it is likely that the | ranks of protestors in Syd- | ney demonstrations and ral- | lies could Teach the 1 0,000 ' | mark m the New Year. | | RICHARD NEVILLE (co- j ! editor of OZ magazine): j I "The most consequential j 1 events of last year were j I those seemingly inconse- I j quential happenings which j | were in a sense sociologic- | I .ally significant, viz., the ft | Beatles' OBE, the reaction j | to Jean Shrimpton's cup- j | day outfit and the Prime j ! Minister's accepting ap- i | pointment as Lord Warden j j of the Cinque Ports." | j ENID HAMPSON, State J I Secretary, Union of Austra- I | lian Women: ! I "For us the most heart- 9 I ening thing about 1965 was j j the response we had from | the people of Sydney to our i | campaign against war toys g I and jumping prices. It j | showed that these two ques- t I tions have been of consid- 1 erable concern to mothers 1 j and housewives for some I Â® 2 | time. I | "Press, TV and Parlia- j j ment also had a lot to say j I about the questions. j j "We were also consider- I ably heartened by the grow- | 1 ing opposition to the war | ! in Vietnam. j f "It is noteworthy that j I opposition to the war is ex- I tending to different sec- | | tions of the population, and | , | nearly everybody who has j 1 had the opportunity to learn j the facts and history of the | war has begun to oppose the I government's policy." j PAT CLANCY, State Sec retary, Building Workers 1 Industrial Union: I "While the year has seen la number of reverses for I the working class, expressed I in the very bad wages de- I cision by the Arbitration |, Commission, election of a j Liberal Govern ment in NSW and the attack on the g Waterside Workers' Fede- I ration, it has - also seen a tremendous strengthening of | the peace movement. - | "There has also been a ! strong move towards .indus- 1 trial unionism, which means 8 stronger trade unionism. | "Examples of this was the I amalgamation of the Boil- f ermakers and Blacksmiths | Societies, the proposed mer- | ger of the two printing j unions and discussions now g taking place among build- g ing unions for closer co- S operation. f "The prospects of united ! action in the Ne\y Year look | bright, and this action will j be necessary to win the de- j mands of ! the trade union j movement." i i
