 Hearty reunion of war criminals in Rendsburg More than 1000 veterans of Hit ler's nazi SS elite gathered at the Kid of October in the north German city of Rendsburg. The commander of this parade was former SS Lieutenant Colonel Schaefer. He maintained that any objection against his SS veterans was "com munist propaganda". Frantic ap plause was given to the principal guest of honour SS general Sepp Dietrich, one of Hitler's favourite nazi generals who was sentenced 25 years for war crimes, prelimin arily released and is unhindered now singing the praises of the nazi movement and helping to organize to keep the nazi ideology awake. The Jewish Council again points out that the pro- nazi fascist forces have not given up and that it is fiacred duty of every Jew, in fact every democrat, to combat this evil.
