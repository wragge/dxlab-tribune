 A skin rejects proposal for Roval Commission gYDNEY: New South Wales Premier Askin has rejected a proposal to appoint a Royal Com mission to Investigate all aspects of the Collier Moat and associated companies affair. The companies, investigated by an inspector appointed by the former Labor government, were struck off the Sydney Stock Exchange. The Leader of the Opposition in the NSW Parliament, Mr. Renshaw, in a letter to the Premier said "that- only a full and open enquiry in the form of a Royal Commission could thorough ly ventilate the matter, satisfy public conscience, and ensure that justice is done. Mr. Renshaw also wrote that "while this matter is exercising the public mind and causing widespread concern, the Opposition considers that it would be proper, because of his associations with the companies concerned and because of his present position as Minister of Justice, that the honour able John Clarkson Maddison should request that he be relieved of his portfolio pending the course and find ings of the Royal Commission which I have proposed.
