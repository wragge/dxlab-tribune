 ONE-PARTY GOVT. MORE DEMOCRATIC DELAIDE â€” "If democracy means that the will of the majority shall prevail then I suggest that the system bv which we doctor our democracy is open to very severe criticism." This comment on democracy in Aus tralia was made by Mr. Paul Moraw- etz, former economic adviser to the UN for Africa and now adviser to the President of Chad. Mr. Morawetz was lecturing in Adel aide on "Practices of Democracy in the World Today". He said that in Australia a majority of the people had voted "on more occasions than I care to recall" for a certain political party which had not got in. The visiting lecturer went on to say that it could be much more democra tic to have a one party government. Describing his impressions of Com munist China during his recent visit, Mr. Morawetz said that the Chinese appeared to have succeeded better than the Indians in giving their people a better life.
