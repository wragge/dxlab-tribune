 1 .. . ' — — — i yft jh Wanted I A Xmas present I By THE CHALLENGER" i Xmas cetainly seems to be arriving late—if it B it is going to arrive at all— for Australian sport H this year. |_AST week has seen a numoer of setbacks in different fields of sport. In athletics, the East Ger man (German Democratic Re public) miler, Jurgen May has been unable to obtain a spon sor, which would have enabled him to compete here against the great Kenyan runner Kipchoge | Keino. | Keino holds the world's 3,000 and 5,OOC metres track records. Recently he was beaten in New Zealand on two occasions by the East German, Jurgen May. Last Wednesday in Auckland Jurgen May went within half a second of breaking Frenchman Michael Jazy's mile world re cord of 3m. 53.6sec. But for a sponsor, so enabling May and Keino to compete against each other here, there seemed a great possibility of a new world re- Icord being set for the mile. In soccer, the Sydney team, Apia looks like losing one of its star players, Johnny Wong, unless a deportation order by the Department of Immigration, is revoked. Malayan-born Wong, has been studying accountancy in Sydney on a student's visa and has just completed his final examina tions. Wong has expressed his desire to stay here for another year or two, and Sydney soccer is cer tainly keen to have him stay. The president of Apia, Mr. Eddie Provera, has said that they will do everything in their power to get an extension of another year for Wong. These two examples of "un necessary" setbacks to sport are but a reflection of the Austra lian government's reactionary policy of immigration — the white Australia policy and also its foreign policy of non- I recognition of certain socialist countries. Another two lessons emphasis ing the need for a change. A comeback I By Ron Mackerras If HEN I wrote the Eddie Miller 1 story for Tribune, I hoped jf it would create debate and ! M criticism if necessary. || If criticism was necessary, it If could only be paid on the ac- | 1 curacy of Eddie Mller's record I If or the high praise paid by I If English critics when they com- | pared his skill with the great If Jim Driscoll. || Nowhere did I glamorize pro- 1 fessional boxing. || I wrote of a youth who, he- f| cause of the depression years, was denied the right to perman- ent employment. Instead, he j| turned to professional boxing, i Ike hundreds of others during || this period. || His father was a hard work- i i ing Scottish migrant. His bro- II ther Tommy, who found the || grind of early morning road- || work and gym work-outs un-' i attractive, found his way to the 1 Sydney wharves. 1 Jack Frame, Eddie Miller's || early tutor and life time friend 1 of the Miller family, supplied 1 me with much of the material f| for the Eddie Miller story. He 1 agrees that professional box- || ing is a fast passing phase o! fj capitalist society, but still with || us. 11 My experience with workers is || that most professional boxers m on retirement become very good || trade unionists; many give out- 1 standing service .to the two 1 working class political parties. I Tommy Uren's record as a | former professional boxing 1 champion, would make good I reading in Tribune or trade I union journals, practically every | trade unionist and peace fighter | kn-ows of his record championing 1 their causes in Federal Parlia- ; Jf ment and at peace rallies I g throughout the country. s/j ! iia.wm Hili I Ml
