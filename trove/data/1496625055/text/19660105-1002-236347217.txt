 M.LA. WANTS BREAD INQUIRY CYDNEY: The Labor Member for Fairfield (Mr. L. J. Ferguson) has demanded a full Govern ment innuirv into the bread industry, following the increase of Id on a two pound loaf of bread. The increase wa Â« recently granted by the N.S.W. Prices Commissioner (Mr. Newibigging). Mr. L. J. Ferguson calling for the in quiry said that, "it looks like a happy new year for the Bread manu facturers with bigger and better profits ". Mr. Ferguson said: "From my knowledge of the bread industry a Id. increase in the price of a two lb. loaf is not justified as costs have not gone up anywhere near that much. "In the past few years we have seen the bread industry being drawn into fewer and fewer hands. "I believe that there should be a Government inquiry into the in dustry, its ramifications and waste fulness. " One aspect of the inquiry should be to examine why the few monopo lies now controlling the industry need a. price increase when there is unlimited returns of unsold bread, and they can give giant stores 25 per cent commission compared to 121 per cent for the small shops," Mr. Ferguson concluded.
