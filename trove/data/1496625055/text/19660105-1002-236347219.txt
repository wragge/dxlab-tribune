 MENZIES' RESIGNATION CANBERRA: The now, certain retirement of Sir Robert Menzies is leading to dog-fights among Cabinet Ministers for higher port- folios. rpHE promotion of the Minister for External Affairs (Mr. Hasluck) to the Privy Council was well timed following his recent pasting from the press for his refusal to meet them on return from his South-East Asian tour. Minister for Labor McMahon, who is fighting it out with Hasluck for deputy leadership of the Liberal Party when Menzies steps down, cut short his honeymoon to return to Canberra. The present Treasurer (Mr. Holt) will be the new Prime Minister, despite strong support by the big financial interests behind the Mel bourne Herald for the leader of the Country Party, Mr. McEwen. The election of Holt as Prime Minister will not mean any essential change in policy. What is likely to happen is that Holt's election will place even greater strains on the Liberal - Country Party coalition, opening up new opportuni ties for the Labor Movement in 1966.
