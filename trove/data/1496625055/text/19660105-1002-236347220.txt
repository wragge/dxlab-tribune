 i WILL THEY 1 EVER LEARN? i |T is 20 years since the end of J| World War II, since the dropping Ml of the hellish atomic bomh on Hiro- ||| shima and Nagasaki, hut despite £f this astronomical sums of money || are being spent on planes, bombs i|| (conventional and nuclear) and WM other diabolical weapons such as pij the Lazy Dog bomb and the arma- lite rifle — all Assigned for mass annihilation of human lives. A recent report in the UNESCO "Courier" states that the cost of one new supersonic bomber, fully equipped, would equal: The salaries of 25 teachers for one year, or © 20 science faculties of 1000 stud ents each, or © 75 fully equipped hospitals of 100 beds, or 50,000 tractors or 15,000 harvest ers. The money spent for each of the most recent atomic submarines would provide a great modern hospital for 50 cities. In the USA employment in certain industries— those dealing with produc tion of death weapons — is increasing, while the workers therein receive higher pay. Now they are to be taxed much heavier in order to pay for the increased cost of production. How stupid can a nation become? The world has reached an appalling stage of "civilisation" when with each plane destroyed with a consequent loss of young men's lives, the arma ment manufacturers eagerly look for ward to building another two planes to replace it. Human lives count for nought when compared with the pro fit in dollars. In their scramble for power, the maniacs in the Pentagon seem bent on having an atomic war For such a holocaust there will be few, if any, survivors.— G. F. Phillips, Sydney.
