 Kill ! GETTING AWAY | WITH MURDER tv " I "f"HE bombing of North I Vietnam by the USA I and the threat of future bombing of Hanoi and other cities in the north bring to mind the old say ing "Some people can get away with murder". The shame of this is, of course, that the US is supported by our own reactionary Federal Government led by Menzies and the rest of the bunch. They are also supported by the DLP and Santamaria. Now an ardent supporter is Archbishop Gough, who deserves special montion in view of his statement on his return from Vietnam. . The Archbishop's opinion is that up to the present the trouble has been to find the "Comms" and that if they would come out and fight the war would be over quickly. This opinion is to say the least £ brutal and bloodthirsty. No doubt i the Archbishop read a few months 1 ago where the US and South Viet- | namese troops threw hand grenades I into underground tunnels iand later | the bodies of women and children 1 were dragged out, the bodies of the 1 children being thrown on the ground | like sacks of corn. 1 One must be excused for wondering I if during the Christmas season the I Archbishop offered the usual greet- | ings among which is the wish for | "Peace on earth and goodwill to ll wards all men", or did he, with the | McNamaras, Rusks, Menzies and the | rest offer prayers for the successful | bombing of Hanoi and other thickly populated areas so that the bodies of | more and more children may be || thrown on the ground.— W. McCluskey, i| Belmore.
