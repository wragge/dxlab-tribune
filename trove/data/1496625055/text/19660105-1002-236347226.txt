 SOUND THE ALARM fHE proposal of the Minister for Lands, Mr. T. M. Lewis, to in crease the toll charge for Kuringai Chase from 2/- to 10/- must surely sound the alarm for Sydnevsiders and visitors to our city. Parks and reserves should be the playground for residents of our city, already becoming overcrowded and fenced in with great blocks of con crete home units and flats, should surely be available for the people at a minimum cost, People who work all the week in the smog and grime of Sydney's industrial suburbs need to have the opportunity of fresh air, peace and quiet, and parks and reserves should be available to them at little or no cost. Mr. Lewis will not add to the "pop ularity" of the Askin Government if he proceeds with his plan.â€” Freshair, Sydney.
