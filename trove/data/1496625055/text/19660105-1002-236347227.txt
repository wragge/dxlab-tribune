State Bureau of the | CPA, Mr W. Brown, said = last week. S He was commenting on last I year's final Party building results I and the prospects for the New | Year. I The NSW target for new mem- | bers to the Party of 250 was ex- I ceeded by 122 and the final na- I tional figure for the year was ! 600. | "The gains last year show we | can build towards a mass party In ! this period," Mr. Brown said. I "More than ever the events of i the past year underlined the need | for a stronger Communist Party to | serve the interests of the Austra- | lian people | "In the struggle against the war I in Vietnam, against rising prices | and for improved conditions for ithe workers and higher standards for the people generally, the Com munist Party played a leading | role with other progressive or- ! ganisations and people," he said, jj "Our policy oi serving the best | interests of the Australian people I was the keynote of the Commun- | ist Party's five-point living stand- | ards program which met wide and I favorable support. S "We will continue to fight I around our programme with its central points of price controls | and a £22 basic wage while giving I full support for a united cam- paign around the ACTU basic wage I claim of 38/- now before the Ar- I bitration Court. I He said: "More -and more our | Party in 1965 found the way to | present its case openly and pub- S licly on TV, radio and in the press. | Communist Party challenges were | made to the Liberal Party to de- S bate the issue 'Whose policy is in I Australia's best interests?' These | were evaded but our Party will | continue to press for the debate i in the New Year. I "Encouraged by overfulfilment ! | of our 1965 aims, we will continue | I to campaign for maximum increase j in our membership. I "Main attention this year will I centre on a drive to increase the j circulation of the Tribune in r NSW. I "There will be similar drives in | Victoria and Queensland around i the Guardian newspapers as well | as the Tribune. j NEW 1966 TARGETS j "This in no way means relaxa- j tion in the drive for new mem- g bers. On the contrary, the plan f is to link the drive for new press | sales with the battle for both in- | creased membership and increased ! finance. ) "All districts, sections and j branches are asked to finalise j plans and get their campaign off I to a prompt start. "Proposed NSW targets for 1966 i now being discussed are — j A 10 per cent increase in ) press sales. j New member target of 250 j (districts to increase targets | if desired). j Finance to be discussed on g basis of last year's targets.
