 "Why are our boys dying?" |EW YORK: Nine Northern New Jersey clergymen have denoun ced the U.S. war in Vietnam. They declared: "As clergymen we feel special res ponsibility to ask why American boys are killing and being killed although the U.S. has never declared war. "Three out of four of the killed, not to mention the thousands injur ed are civilians and non-combatants. "In addition, there are non-white people who are guilty of nothing but living in their own country. Three-fourths of the world is non- white. Are we prepared to isolate ourselves from these peoples simply to impose our idea of order?"
