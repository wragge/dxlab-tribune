 ! Youth builds || i the future il ! (From BETTY LOCKWOOD in MOSCOW) | 11 QN our way back from the Far East city of Habar- ovsk we stayed a few days in Irkutsk. Whilst there we spent a day on the beautiful Lake Baikal and flew to Bratsk and back for a six hour visit. What fine autumn scenery the Far East and Siberia has and what won derful people we met and most of them were young. The 18-year-old girl at the mighty switch board of the Bratsk power house. As the voltages changed automatically she had to make the readings. Her name was Bronina. The young 29-year-old chler engin eer of the Irkutsk power house. The many young women in the Khaba rovsk cable factory. We met factory and plant managers, many workers, doctors, teachers, council officials and most of them would have been under 35 years of age. There is no doubt at all that this is the area of youth, most of them went east about ten years ago either voluntarily or with Komsomol organisation. Some were sent be cause experts in certain fields were desperately needed. Many young people are still going there to work. We spoke to one young lad who said he and his friends came there because they preferred the quiet to the big city noises. There is an atmosphere of en thusiasm and pride, and so there should be with the young people running the industries and the towns. Shaiakof is a new town of 24,000 11 people, just a few miles north of SI Irkutsk. The average age of the || townspeople is 17.5 years. And the | town itself is 12 years old. We if drove there one morning along the ||f rough unfinished road avenued by l|f slender birches that gleamed || through the pines. SI Like all the new Siberian cities |gf it was clean, bright and promised il to be very attractive. K We were accompanied by Valen- il tina Gromova, a 37-year-old Council g|| Minister for Education, Culture and Mi Medical Services. fifl There were five schools in the K| town. Four general schools and one h|| boarding school. Thirty minutes B| ride away were Irkutsk institutes, Â«j technical colleges and universities. p| The main trades were the build- jp|| ing and metallurgic plants. The pre- ||;| fab building plant manager was 30 || years old and had come to the area || as a young lad; the forewoman was || quite young. The main industry was i the huge aluminium plant and she f' took us to meet the young workers. &lt;f| We had been told in Habarovsk fa that workers who came to Siberia > M and the Far East received 40 per |f|3 cent more in wages than workers J|J| in other parts of the USSR. Every f Jg year 10 per cent was added for 1 1|| higher skills and extra bonuses r'pl given for extra production. Ill Specialist and skilled workers Ifllj invited out for temporary work re- |K|j ceived extra wages and when gig workers came by request return fares were paid. All workers have |f|| six weeks vacation each year and W&; every three years travel expenses |||||| for holidays are paid. pjl
