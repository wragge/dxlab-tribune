 \" Porgy j 9 ! 1 and | 1 Bess" ! IT was in 1935 that DuBose Heyward's play "Porgy" first engrossed Gershwin in his determination to find a new way of expression in the popular musical theatre. The story of "Porgy and Bess" concerns the love story of a Negro cripple and a girl whom others covet, against the background of knockabout Negro life in Catfish Row, a back street in a city of the Carolinas. Its ingredients are comedy, pathos, violence, laughter, horseplay and poignancy. George Gershwin, already an out standing figure in the musical world, won new honors through the triumphs of "Porgy and Bess". A company of 45 Negro and Maori singers has been brought to Aus tralia for an all capitals tour of the musical, which is now playing to packed houses in Melbourne. "Porgy and Bess" will open at Her Majesty's Theatre, Sydney, on Mon day, January 17, for a five weeks season. The executive director of the Aus tralian Elizabethan Theatre Trust, Mr. Stefan Haag, said that it had been a long cherished dream of the Trust to bring the play to Austra lia. World renowned Maori bass, Inia Te Wiata, sings the role of Porgy and American Negress Phyllis Bash the role of Bess. Ella Berber, who has been asso ciated with almost all of the "Porgy and Bess" productions in the world since 1952, is the producer of the Australian production.
