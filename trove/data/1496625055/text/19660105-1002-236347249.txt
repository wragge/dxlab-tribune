 BEST FUND YET by JUNE MILLS SYDNEY: Although this is the first issue of Tribune for 1966 the following donations finalise the Fund for 1965. MONG the many donors is our old friend Jacob Johnson from West Australia, who not only sent £l, but two tickets in the WA State Lottery — here's hoping they win, for this would certainly help the Fund. In the next issue we'll have the target for 1966, for with the "New Look" Tribune more finance will be needed. While we did not reach the £4000 for 1965, the total donated is the larg est yet raised for Tribune in any one year since the Fund was started. Many thanks to all who helped. With best wishes to all for a peace ful and happy 1966, we look forward to even more support from readers during the coming months.
