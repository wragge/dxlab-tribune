 GOOD START TO TRIBUNE FUND The new target for Tribune Fund is £-1,500 and we're off to a flying start with old and new friends making donations. pRED LOVEDAY, well-known Communist Partv member wrote sending £5. His friends will be glad to know that he is "fairly well but not breaking any records. Many thanks to all comrades for the fine work you are doing and best wishes for 1966". A visit from a long-time friend Alan, brought another £5 for the Fund "be cause of the good work Tribune is doing against the war of aggression in Vietnam".
