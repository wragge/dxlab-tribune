 WA publicans boost beer prices for C-Day PERTH : Rapacious hotel owners (who in the majority of cases are the breweries themselves) are taking ad- vantage of decimal currency conversion to slap on an extra cent to the price of beer served in glasses. According to the WA Liquor In dustry Council's price list, the price of a 7oz. middy in the public bar, which is now 1/3, will be 13 cents, whereas under the decimal conver sion table it should be 12 cents. In the saloon bar, the 7oz. middy at 1/4 will be 14 cents, whereas ac cording to the table it should be 13 cents. The pony in the saloon bar at lOd will sell for 9c, whereas it should be 8c. Publicans will gain about Â£30 a week on the middy alone at this price. The hotel action (as well as that by many manufacturers to reduce the size of packages so that the customer will get less for his money under decimal currency) illustrates the futil ity of Government appeals to profit- eers not to take advantage of con version. Price control is the only way to stop this robbery. Even the staid "West Australian" says editorially: "Fiddling with the conversion to make a little extra will raise a public outcry which is the surest way to produce demands for a return to price control. No retailer can really want that."
