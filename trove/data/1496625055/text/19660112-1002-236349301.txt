 AWU rejects reaf filiation DE'IITH: Decision of the Austra lian Workers' Union WA Branch I not to reaffiliate with the WA Trades and Labor Council is a most re- ! grettable one. It is harmful to the unity of the trade union movement particularly at a time when the maximum unity is necessary in the struggle for the real isation of decent wages and civilised working and living conditions in the developing North West. The decision was made by the AWU executive last week. It was decided to defer the question of the union's reaffiliation with the ALP for six months while it confers with the party's State Executive. The AWU has more than 12,000 members in this State and paid more than Â£1400 a year in affiliation fees to the two bodies. It decided to withdraw in July, expressing dissatis faction with the ALP State Executive administration. The position the AWU has moved into here is identical with its position in other States where it has cut its members off from the benefits of TLC affiliation. The president of the WATLC, Mr. D. W. Cooley, has expressed his dis appointment with the decision. He believed that if the matter had been put to the full membership of the AWU it would have voted overwhelm ingly in favor of it. The decision perpetuates a division which may prove particularly disad vantageous to the workers who are directly concerned. It runs complete ly counter to the interests of the thousands of AWU members scattered throughout our State who are denied the opportunity to express their views on such an important question. It is fair to assert that the over whelming majority of AWU members, if given the opportunity, would de clare their unity with workers in other trades and unions.
