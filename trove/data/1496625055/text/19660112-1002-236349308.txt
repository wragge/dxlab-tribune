 Latin America 'T'HE report given by Eric Aarons (Tribune, 21/12/65) on develop ments in Latin America was very good, but no mention was made of the role played by the Bonn Government. Most of us are well aware of the role played by the United States in Latin America but less is known of the "Bonn help for Latin America" program set up in , 196,1. This program has had some suc cess in Chile,' where the - leader of the Christian Democrats, Frie, with the help of the right wing extremists won the elections early last year. Heinrich Gewant generally refer red to as lieber (dear) Heini in the West German press, has been given much credit for this victory. Lieber Heini was appointed by the Bonn Government under the "Bonn help for Latin America" program, and has been responsible for spend ing of millions of dollars in Chile to bring a relatively unknown per son to power. The fact that West German invest ments in Latin America are relatively small is no reason to minimise Bonn interference in Latin America, nor can it be ignored in Africa or Asia. The Bonn Government appears to concentrate mainly on the export of weapons. In the four years since the "Alliance for Progress" was formed there has been nine coups de etat indicating there is a very profit able market for Krupp's and other West German producers of war material.
