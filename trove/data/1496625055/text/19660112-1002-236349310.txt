 "Rubber" cheques have often been Informed by the press that if any citizen writes a "bounce" cheque they will be in gaol. It seems from reports that some one in H. G. Palmer wrote many "rubber" cheques to pay its debts, yet nobody yet is being charged by the police. Is it a different law for the rich and the poor? I'd be grateful if someone would teach me how to write a "rubber" cheque with immunity from the law. I can assure you I'd have a happy Christmas and so would many other poor people. B.
