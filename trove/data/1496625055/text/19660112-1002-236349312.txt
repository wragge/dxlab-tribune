 War criminals AS an Australian ex-serviceman I am compelled to complain strongly about dangerous former nazi war criminals hiding in Aus- tralia under the complete protec tion of the Federal Government. It is a well known fact that Erwin Viks was admitted to Australia, although he was known as the in human butcher of men, women and children. It is also a well-known fact that there is a nazi-type semi-military organisation, thousands strong, in our country controlled by ex-nazi war criminals acting against legally constituted governments of other powers. Before Sir Robert Menzies retires I sincerely pray that his conscience will be aroused and that he will move in the right direction to take legal action against known ex-war criminals and at the same time make it illegal for pro-fascist or ganisations (such as the Ustashi.) ro lunction nere.
