 "Resf" Homes Having recently spent some time in a Rest Home I am appalled at the disguisting conditions which natients had to suffer in this so- called hospital. Patients are neglected, the food is scant and poor quality. Suffering from an injured spine, I was unable to fend for myself. After two days without even a wash I asked the nurse for some water. After several more requests and the : lapse of some hours the water was dumped on a dressing table and I had to try to wash myself with one hand. I waited five hours for a bed pan, and then had to try and help myself again as it was hard for me to move. An elderly lady in the next bed (also suffering from spinal injury) was so neglected she was becoming light-headed. She could not believe it was any use complaining, but after I told her she should help to expose this terrible exploitation of sick people we both spoke to her doctor who arranged for her removal. Talking to one of the nurses I learnt of one similar hospital which had one nurse for 30 patients. Another nurse told me she was leaving as she could not bear to see sick people neglected. I think we should protest very loudly about a society where ex ploitation thrives, not only against the sick but in every way; for the sake of the very old people in these dreadful places I only hope something can be done.
