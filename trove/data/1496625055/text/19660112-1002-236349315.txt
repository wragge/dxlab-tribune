 0000000 LBJ and Ky — two sides of the same penny A NEWS item in The Aus- tralian (24.12.1965) headed "We wont Talk Peace, says Ky" said, in part: "In Tokyo yesterday South Viet nam's Premier, Air Vice-Marshal Ky, published a statement that his coun try will never take part in negotia tions for a peaceful settlement of the war. So far as South Vietnam was concerned, there could be no end to the war through negotiations." President Johnson has vowed on more than one occasion that he is prepared to go anywhere, any time, to take part in negotiations for a peaceful settlement of the war. Now it is very difficult to be lieve that these two men are talk ing about the same war— but they are. They are referring to the war now being fought in Vietnam. Is it any wonder that Mr. Has- luck at first refused to talk to reporters on his recent return from Vietnam and South East Asia? I looked forward to his belated press conference in Perth to see if he followed Air Vice-Marshal Ky's line or that of President Johnson. j: Jusificous. Melbourne (Victoria).
