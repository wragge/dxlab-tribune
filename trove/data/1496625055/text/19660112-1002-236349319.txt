 CONGO STALL ON SANCTIONS BRAZZAVILLE: The Government of the Leopoldville Congo (says TASS) was forced by public opinion to announce that it would not main- tain relations with the Smith regime in Rhodesia. But the huge Belgian- American trust Union Miniere quickly made known that it didn't want sanctions against Smith, following which Congo foreign minister Bomboko failed to attend a meeting of African ministers to plan action against Smith.
