 j — — — I Australia under attack over Rhodesia ; ! "AUSTRALIA is as much | a race baiter as Ian Smith is I in Rhodesia," comments the I Nigerian newspaper "Daily j Sketch" on Sir Robert j Menzie's refusal to have Aus- | tralia officially represented at | the Commonwealth Confer- | ence in Lagos, Nigeria. I The paper said that this was the' j reason why "the Australian Prime | Minister is fuming over the i Commonwealth Prime Minister's ! Conference." I The Australian Government re- | fused to send an official delegate | to the special Commonwealth con- I ference on Rhodesia which opened j in Lagos, Nigeria, yesterday, j This indicates that the Menzies | Government doesn't want to be j party to any majority decision If taken at the conference, to take I stronger action against the illegal S Smith regime. | It's also to protect Australia's go | slow policy in relation to the de- s velopment of independence for New Guinea. As Sir Robert Menzies said: "If I Britain can be instructed or 1 coerced by the Commonwealth or I most of its members in a matter which is, by concession, her's and her's alone to deal with, then Australia can some day be instructed or coerced on some matter which sole jurisdiction re sides with Australia." While the Menzies Government official representative stays home the British Prime Minister (Mr. Wilson) will attend the conference. The Prime Minister's immediate agreement in principle with the British Government's proposed dsrought relief scheme for South Africa, which is to include Rhodesia has come under attack. The N.S.W. secretary of the | Primary Producers' Union, Colonel | Godtschalk, said: there was a cry- ing need for additional drought relief in Australia. || He added: "When you consider | the trouble we had in persuading | the Commonwealth Government 3 that the drought was its responsibility, this promptness is incredible."
