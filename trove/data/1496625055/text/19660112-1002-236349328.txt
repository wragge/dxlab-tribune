 Death of Mr. Shastri Within minutes last Monday the Soviet city of Tashkent was turned from a city of joy and happiness on the completion of a peace pact be- tween India and Pakistan into a bereaved city. Only hours after signing the peace pledge with Ayub Khan of Pakistan, the Indian Prime Minister, Mr. Shastri collapsed and died of a heart attack in Tashkent. Always a physically weak and frail man, Mr. Shastri suffered from a heart condition for some time. He had just completed many hours of long and arduous discus sions with Ayub Khan and the Sov- . iet Premier (Mr. Kosygin) which ; ended in an agreement between ; India and Pakistan to withdraw their troops and restore normal relations in Kashmir. Apparently the strain was too | much for him. Mr. Shastri became Prime Min- , ister on the death of Nehru, some 18 months ago. The Minister for Home Affairs, Mr. Gukzarilal Nanda, has been sworn in as the new Prime Minister ! of India. Peace lovers throughout the world will be grieved at the loss of Mr. Shastri.
