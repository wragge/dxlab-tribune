 The BBC bans a song THE MANFRED MANNS ARE "WAYOUT": ' - —i linn 1. I dreamed I said to President Johnson Now listen to me, man, That's a good line in double-talk Ynii'vp crnt in Vietnam. And don't think I don't know Who's causing all this fuss Cos every time you say them I .know you mean us. CHORUS: It was a dream, a dream I had last night, I dreamed I solved all the problems And set the world to rights. 2. , I dreamed I told Mr. Wilson You heard what I said to him Well don't think , you're excluded Because I count you in. Before you got in power You said the States had caused this war But now you need their money And you don't say that any more. 3. I dreamed President Johnson said to me Oh, please be kind I need some sympathy I'm going out of my mind I've got ants in my pants and bees in my bonnet And reds under the bed And I need a new dictator out there Cos yesterday's one is dead. 4. Then in chimes Ho Chi Minh to say You guys you needn't fight There's only one way to do this thing And do it right That's get out of my country Leave it for my people and me And while you are about it take your little Hitler friend And drop him in the sea. —PAUL JONES. POP-SINGER Paul Jones, lead vocalist of the Manfred Mann beat group said that a song about Vietnam he plann- ed to sing on B.B.C. tele vision had been banned, ac cording to the London Daily Worker. The song, called "Paul's Dream" exposes the double- talk of President Johnson and British Prime Minister Wilson on the war in Vietnam, and ends with a call for foreign troops to leave that war-torn country. "I wrote the song to make a point on an issue I feel strongly about and to achieve something to help end the Vietnam war," Paul Jones said. PAUL JONES is the lead singer in the Manfred Mann group.
