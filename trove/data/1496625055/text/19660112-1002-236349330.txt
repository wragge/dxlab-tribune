 I OPPOSITION TO JOHNSON 1 ! I i Last Tuesday's Australian, reporting this, said that Mr. Calwell was ex pected to tell Harriman that the Menzies Government policy on Viet- nam has lost the support of the majority of the Australian people. J All American I I Sharp criticism in Government circles is growing against President i Johnson at home. ! I A US Senate team report on the I Vietnam war is reported to have | shaken President Johonson. I It was prepared by Senator Mans- | field and virtually calls on the US I to get out of Vietnam now with the I best possible settlement terms. 1 Senator Mansfield, who had made I a global tour with four other | Senators, warned that if peace f efforts failed the war could spread ; j to a general war on the Asian i mainland. ; I Senator Wayne Morse has urged President Johnson not to escalate the war. He stressed that this would play into the hands of the "Bellicose Governments" created by the US in South Vietnam, South Korea and Taiwan. He sharply criticised a call from the South Korean Government to the US to bomb Hanoi. Victor Wilson, reporting in the Herald Tribune from New York, says that if the Vietnam war goes on it will almost certainly become an all American show. He writes: "But the weekend failure of the American commanders to inform the South Vietnamese until the last minute of the big drive against the Communist Iron Triangle was seen as another indication of the Americans taking full charge. . . . "The desertion rate among the South Vietnamese reached a peah last summer. Then, as the American troop build-up began, the rate dropped. But recently, it is under stood, desertions began rising again.'
