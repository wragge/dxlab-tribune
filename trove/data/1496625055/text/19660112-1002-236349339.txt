 Ho Chi Minh's j New Year message President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam Ho Chi Minh on December 31, 1 965 sent a New Year message to the American people. The message said: "On the occasion of the New Year I wholeheartedly wish the American people peace, prosperity and happiness. "The Vietnamese people are striv ing persistently for peace, but peace cannot be real without real inde pendence. American imperialists are committing an aggression in Viet nam, and the Vietnamese people have to fight to protect independence and preserve peace. "The ruling circles of the United States speak of peace, but actually step up war. Let American im perialists cease aggression, terminate all military operations against the DRV and withdraw the US troops from South Vietnam so that the Vietnamese people could settle their affairs as laid down in the Geneva Agreements of 1954, and peace will at once be established in Vietnam. "The Vietnamese people prize highly the friendship with the great American people," the message says. "I warmly greet and thank the American people for demanding that the US Government end the aggressive war in Vietnam. You are doing it, friends, also to save many young Americans from useless death in an unjust war against Vietnam, which is thousands upon thousands of miles away from the United States. "I wish the American people new triumphs in the struggle for demo cracy, peace and happiness." HO CHI MINH
