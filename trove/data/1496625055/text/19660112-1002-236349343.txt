 NSW Government make it harder for home seekers gYDNEY : A building indus try union leader this week attacked moves by the N.S.W. Government to cut applicants off the waiting list for Housing Commission homes. Mr. F. Purse, Federal Sec retary of the Building Workers Industrial Union, said, "the moves were being made in order to give the impression that the Govern ment was doing a far better job on housing than was really the case". Mr. Purse was commenting on a statement by Mr. Stephens, N.S.W- Minister for Housing, who said that "applicants for Housing Commission accommodation are now required to give detailed in formation as to their financial Circumstances, and to state the action taken by them to obtain suitable permanent accommodation other than through jtjhe Commis sion." Mr. Purse was also commenting on what had not been stated by the Minister, that applicants already on the waiting list for Housing Com mission homes have to make fresh applications. "Applicants for Housing Commis sion Homes in N.S.W. have always been carefully screened, so that moves by the present Government would only make it more difficult for families to obtain Government homes. "They would be then forced into the hands of speculators," Mr. Purse said. He said that, "N.S.W. had between 30,000 and 35,000 families on the Housing commission waiting list. This was the biggest number of any State." It was to be expected that a Government that favours the land lords would be expected to do such things. MR. F. PURSE, Federal Secretary, BWU . . . forced into the hands of speculators. MR. STEPHENS, N.S.W. Housing Minister . . . detailed information as to their financial circumstances.
