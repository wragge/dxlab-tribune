 Finance Needed For Surf Clubs By Trevor Mott Since the beginning of the Life Saving movement in 1907-8, over 112,000 lives have been saved. Life Saving Clubs, if they were financed by the poker machine bonanza like that of other clubs would be far more able to jtJi uywuy equip tnemseives and thus be better able to carry out their motto: Vigilance and Ser vice. If this is not possible, then what about insurance companies, which benefit from the lives saved, being forced by govern ment legislation to pay a subsidy to the Surf Life Savers on every person rescued by the Australian life savers. Admittedly the State and Federal Governments subsidise the Life Saving movement to a tune of £5,000 in N.S.W. plus a grant of £3,000 from the Federal Government. Considering all the clubs on our coastline, the money granted L is only peanuts and, in fact, j wouldn't buy every club a life I saving reel (£60), let alone pro- j vide them with surfboats (£600), ; etc. j It is a fact that the surf clubs i outside the city 'areas are finding it very difficult to make out as j the population of some surfing j resorts is not even around 1,000 j people. I The residents don't mind j donating to surf clubs, but they j don't like being asked to do so j about every month or so. I Mostly, they are only working | people and with them every j penny counts in their budget. They find it hard to donate to j the life saving movement. j A partial solution to the j position as we now have it is I that we either (1) have both j State and Federal Governments grant £100,000 (possibly still not | enough) annually to be distri- I buted fairly to the surf clubs j and (2) have insurance com- I panies pay a subsidy to the I clubs for every insured person ( rescued, or have licensed clubs j (away from the beaches) so as to benefit from the operation of ! I poker machines. j |
