Not I I necessarily as an opener, but j j preferably so as a partner for | Bill Lawry, thus allowing Bob S Simpson to regain his confidence | at first wicket down. | Thomas's batting was a delight, I a mixture of caution when neces- I sary, and attacking anything | loose. His hooking brought about g his downfall, after an exciting ! 51. £ ' _„j
