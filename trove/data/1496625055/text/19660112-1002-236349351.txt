 They never dare to risk their own money KARL MARX looks at the credit system, and finds that under capitalism ... I The recent scandalous company failures, from IVM and Reid Murray to H. G. Palmer, has focussed all eyes on a credit system which has enabled a few to make huge profits while thousands of small in vestors have lost their savings. |£ARL MARX last century analysed the operation of the credit system under capitalism. This analysis in "Capital" Volume 2 (Chap ter 27) could well have been written today. He wrote: "The capital itself, which a man really owns or is supposed to own in the opinion of the public, be comes purely a basis for the super- structure or credit, l'nis is par ticularly true of wholesale com merce, through which the greatest portion of the social product passes. All standards of measurement, all excuses more or less still justified under capitalist production, disappear here. What the speculating whole sale merchant risks is social property, not his own. Equally sordid becomes the phrase relating the origin of capital to savings, for what he de mands is that others should save for him. The other phrase concerning ab stention is squarely refuted by his luxury, which is not itself a means of credit." 1 Time has not stood sttil, of course, "Progress" has brought retail trade up to the level of wholesale mer chandising! Marx summarised the operation of the credit system as being "To develop the incentive of capitalist production, enrichment through the exploitation of the labor of others, to the purest and most colossal form of gambling and swindling, and to reduce more and more the number of the few who exploit the social wealth, ..." Foreign control A lack of confidence by Australian investors and increasing control by foreign monopolies is shown in the latest report of NSW Registrar of Companies, Mr. F. J. O. Ryan. The report shows there were 3,873 new companies registered in 1965 with a nominal capital of £70.4 million. This was a fall of 27 from the 4,175 new companies in 1964 with a nominal capital of £82.3 million. This is the lowest figure for over 10 years, and shows a decline from the peak 1960 figure of 6,514 new companies with a nominal capital of £305.2, million. In addition, press reports show a fall in the value of shares in 1965 by over £3 million less than 1964. The report shows the trend toward foreign control. There were 413 foreign companies registered in NSW in 1965 as against 386 in 1964. .Their nominal capital rose from £103 mil lion in 1P64 to £138.5 million in 1965. A further indication of the insta bility of the economy is the fact that 1,379 local companies and 357 foreign companies were removed from the registers following liquidation or action taken under the Companies ACt. The number of companies as at December 31, 1965, which appeared to be carrying on business was approxi mately 61,436 local' and 4,379 foreign, totalling 66,372. The report shows that special in vestigations dealing with the affairs of Collier Moat Ltd., International Vending Machines Ltd., and Latec Investments Ltd. were terminated in 1965. Investigations were proceeding into the affairs of H. G. Palmer Ltd., and at the close of the year there were 65 companies under investigation, with a further 122 awaiting attention. Of the latter 83 relate to companies j,n liquidation. This report is in direct contrast to Mr. Holt's claim of an expanding economy and falls far short of the economist's figure of a 4 per cent, annual increase needed for a healthy economy. KARL MARX
