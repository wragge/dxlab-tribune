 ' """"""I Jungle greens j or cricket pads! i The record book states that Kevin Douglas I Walters, the brilliant NSW batsman, was born j December 21, 1945. Already at the young age of 20 years Walters has distinguished himself as j j one of Australia's most capable and promising j cricketers. j Walters first gained promin ence when in 1962, as a late replacement in the N.S.W. Colts team against Queensland he top- scored with 140 not out. In his first two Sheffield Shield matches against Victoria, and Queensland he made cen turies. This was repeated in his Test debut at Brisbane during the current series where he joined the selected band of cricketers who scored a First Test cen tury. He iscored another cen tury in the Second Test. With a batting record like this and the fact that he is an out standing medium-pace bowler, the average cricket fan could very well comment on Walters thus: "This fellow has every thing plus youth on his side." But herein lies the rub, for the "youth" that should mean a brilliant cricket future, could quite easily mean cannon fodder as an Australian conscript (Wal ters is eligible for call-up) in the dirty Vietnam war — a war the Menzies government with its rotten foreign policy has involved Australia in, and can only lead to the further unnecessary killing of Australian youths. Tribune therefore urges, not only cricket but all sport fans to investigate the facts of the dirty Vietnam war, so as to join their voice to the increasing number of protests to the Men zies' government. Such action would not only help to bring about peace, but could help to save young Wal ters for what he is so obviously suited — big time cricket.
