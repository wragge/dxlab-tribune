 Tim Buck's 75th birthday World tributes are being paid this month to Tim Buck, national president of the Communist Party of Canada, who has just celebrated his 75th birthday. \/|R. L. L. SHARKEY, former general secretary of the Com munist Par,ty of Australia, this week praised the work of Mr. Buck. He described him as a man whose whole life has been devoted to the cause of the working class, for inter national peace and the triumph of socialism and Communism. Mr. Sharkey said Tim Buck was an outstanding internationalist. He was . a great propagandist, carrying out many speaking tours over a vast territory. Tim Buck had played an import ant role in the international Com munist meetings in Moscow in 1957 and 1960. "He is truly one of the old brigade of the international communist movement", said Mr. Sharkey, who also paid tribute to the hard struggle of the Canadian Communist Party to unite the workers in a rich .country divided into two nationali- ties, the English and French-speak ing Canadians. The Party also heads the fight against the power of U.S. monopoly capital which, from its base close by, dominates much of Canada's industry. Tim Buck visited Australia for the last Congress of the Australian Communist' Party in 1964. He impressed observers as having the vigor of a man of 20 to 30 years his junior. It was hard to&lt; realise that he had been the associate of Tom Mann and also knew Keir ,Hardie well. In a final message to Australians in leaving, he said that the road to victory in the struggle for peace, de mocracy, and socialism in both Australia and Canada included the struggle to prevent the control of their economies from passing to U.S. imperialism.
