 Unions' positive plan It can be solved if the following steps are taken that conform to the demands of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the . Building Workers' Industrial Union, Mr. Purse said. As a first step there should be an immediate doubling of the finance- allocation under the Commonwealth- States Housing Agreement Reserve funds held by the banks should be released for private home building. A special Â£100 m. loan should be floated to assist co-operatives and other approved home building or ganisations. Interest rates on all housing finance to be fixed at not more than 3 per cent. The rental rebate system should be introduced and reintroduced in order to ensure that those unable to house themselves enjoy the benefits of a dwelling of good standard and equipment, which is the right of every citizen. Price control should be imposed on all material required for housing and taxation concessions allowed on all materials purchased for home building. Price control should be imposed over the price of land. Land speculation should be con trolled and no-deposit land should be available to home builders. Crown lands should be released to the people for home building at a previously determined low price by ballot instead of as at present by auction to the highest bidder. Also home' purchasers and tenants should be protected against dispossession 'or eviction when as a result of sickness or unemployment they fall into arrears with their pay ments. Slum clearance should be carried out in the inner suburban areas and higher density housing developed in the reclaimed areas. This should halt or mitigate the sprawl that is so evident today- in our capital cities,' reduce strain on transport and other services &nd save the fares and travelling time of the workers.
