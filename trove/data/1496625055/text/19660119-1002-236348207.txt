Niles, a minister in g | the Methodist Church, of Cey- I Ion and General Secretary of | I the East Asian Christian Con- j | ference, said this to an audience ? ! of 150 at a luncheon in Perth J | on January 11. The function j I was organised by the Church i | and Community Committee on ! | Vietnam. I I Ancrlinon Arphhichnn rvf I 1 Perth, the Most Rev. George Appleton, in opening1 the luncheon j I said the capacity' attendance was! J a symbol of people's desire for j j world peace, whatever the method j | they might be working for it. S jj Replying to a question, Dr. Niles j | said the need was for Australia ! 1 to have its own foreign policy, j I "What is important for the I future of Asia is the image the j | U.S. is building up, and it seems s | to me it is not an image which J ! would give the U.S. any serious j j constructive role in Asia, in the j | future," he stated in his address, j | Speaking of the letter the East j | Asian Christian Conference had ! ! sent to the National Council of j j Churches in the U.S. and the j j British Council of Churches, he 5 j said: I i "From our point of view, the I primary combatants are the ( I South Vietnamese Government % f and the Viet Cong. So the primary j | thing is to bring these two com- 1 j batants together. The U.S. is! ! helping South Vietnam, North | j Vietnam is helping the Viet Cong, j I We can't first ask the helpers to = ! sit down to the conference table." j I From this point of view, the I ) present "peace offensive" of the | i U.S. was rather unrealistic, nei I said- It was unrealistic to expect 1 J Hanoi to accept that they are j j directing the war for the Viet 1 | Cong. The thing was, could we get | 1 the South Vietnamese Govern- 1 I ment and the Viet Congj j t o talk. Then any accord i | reached would have to be I 1 accepted by the U.S. and Hanoi. I 1 The armed presence of Austra- I | lia and New Zealand, he con- | j sidered, ' were irrelevant as far g | as peace negotiation in Vietnam ! | is concerned. They were there to j be in the good books of the U.S. £ | The East Asian Christian Con- j i ference had got into contact with 1 I the Governments of North Viet- 1 | nam about relief. This is an effort | | for the Church to be present, g j serving man in time of need. ! g The main need was to use the! ! strength of the churches to get | | the primary combatants to say I | "We will talk peace." j OMtl — ll — 11M11
