 Land and mineral rights for Aborigines yDELAIDE â€” Land and mineral rights for Aborigines are incor porated in the Aboriginal Lands Trust Bill which the Labor Govern- ment is bringing before parliament. ! The Bill creates an Aboriginal Lands | Trust which would consist entirely of j Aborigines or people of Aboriginal ! blood. I Reserve land and, it was hoped, ad ditional land, would be handed over to the Trust. The Bill provides that all metals, minerals, oil and gas on Trust land would pass to the Trust. Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr. D. Dunstan) told parliament: "This Bill takes a significant step in the treatment of Aboriginal people hot only in this State but in Australia". He continued: "The Aboriginal peo ple of this country are the only com parable indigenous people who have been given no specific rights in their own land. "The Maoris, Eskimos, the Amer ican Indians all have treaty rights and ownership and control of lands in their countries." Mr. Dunstan pointed out that pre sent Aboriginal reserved land was Crown land, not owned and control led by the Aborigines, and from which they could be removed. He said it was not surprising that Aborigines throughout Australia were bitter that they had their country taken away from them and had been given no compensatory rights to land in any area.
