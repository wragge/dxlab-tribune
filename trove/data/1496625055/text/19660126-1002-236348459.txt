While addressed to both sides, the statement asked the US to stop air attacks both in north and south Vietnam, to express a clear intention to withdraw its forces from Viet nam and to state unequivocally its readiness to negotiate an end of the war. The horrors of aircraft and the massive firepower which the , US was inflicting on the Viet nam people were "beyond any moral or political justification" 1 said the statement.
