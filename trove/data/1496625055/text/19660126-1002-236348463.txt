 THEY CAN'T BOTH BE RIGHT! A semor public servant of the State Local Government De partment last week effectively contradicted his own Minister (Mr. P. Morton) who had told the daily press the Askin Gov ernment was "vitally concerned" about the rates burden, but had no control over local govern- ment on rates. ("Herald", 19/1/66.) On the same page, the De partment's Under Secretary (Mr. J. Monaghan) was re ported to have written to Black- town Council describing its de cision to raise rates as "most unsound" and urging it to revise its estimates.
