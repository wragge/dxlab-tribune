 We're on the map in ballet SYDNEY: Australia established its own place in the world ballet scene during the overseas tour of the Australian Ballet Company which returned to Sydney by air last Thursday. READERS of the com pany told Tribune that the ballet public in London, including critics and teachers, had been "absolutely staggered" by the fact that a com pany of such artistic standard could be devel oped in Australia. The company, which had been away for 5 months, had based the tour on par ticipation at the Common wealth Festival in London, but also performed in Le banon, south of France, Glasgow, Liverpool, Covent Garden (London), Paris, Copenhagen, Berlin, Paris, Los Angeles and Honolulu. In the 20,000 miles of tra velling they danced before 171,000 people in 67 per formances. Miss Peggy Van Praag, dir ector, said that in addition to building the prestige of Australian artistry and cul ture generally, the tour would prove to have broad ened the younger dancers through the experience of dancing in various condi tions, despite difficulties, and of performing before outstanding teachers. At Paris, loss of costumes and make-up, and dancing on a noisy, unsuitable stage, had imposed difficulties, yet the company had an im portant win at the interna tional festival there, even beating the famous Kirov company (USSR) in the prize for an all-round production. Miss Van Praag said the company should stay and t dance in Australia for at least a year, to consolidate &lt;he experience, but it was hoped to go overseas again. "Not too soon, however," she said. "It's too exhaust ing." Miss Kathleen Gorham, prima ballerina, said: "The ovation we Australians re ceived at Covent Garden will live with us for many years."
