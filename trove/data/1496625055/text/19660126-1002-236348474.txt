 Bridging the gap rpHE ARTICLE on unemploy ment published in Tribune (8/12/65) drew attention to what was considered to be a major problem in periods of "recession" since the end of the war. That is â€” how to arouse the interest of those , employed workers in the problems that face their unemployed, former workmates. My own experience during the 1950's and 1960 as a rail way wdrker confirmed that many of those still working treated a lot of the stories about unemployment as non sense. Presentation of this question, particularly in the working class press, has to take this problem into account. Material on unemployment must be acceptable to both employed and unemployed. I feel that many sections of the article referred to would not help to bridge the differ ence of view between em ployed and unemployed workers as the "same old Commo jargon." Over-simplification also gave the impression that the author was writing about the 1930's and not the specific circum stance of the 1960's. I would like to propose that Tribune carry a series of articles on this topic in order to give a more all-sided and convincing picture. BRIAN DUNNETT, Sydney (NSW).
