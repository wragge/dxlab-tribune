 Sick of TV anti-Red films ALTHOUGH I am only 12 years old, I am sick of seeing TV films about Russian spies shooting at American bases and Chinese with evil- looking eyes hiding on isolated islands while planning to bomb the world. / Do American film companies produce shows like this be cause they really believe they should poison people's minds about socialism? I think they do because they are afraid that socialist ideas will spread. I would prefer that they showed films of "the war in Vietnam â€” not that I would like it, but because it would make people realise what a cruel war it is. If they did show films like this they wouldn't even have to use actors; all they would have to do is go to Vietnam. Unlike the television pro grammes showing ruthless Russians and evil Chinese, the war in Vietnam is a bitter realitv. SHERRIE CROSS (Gymea Bay).
