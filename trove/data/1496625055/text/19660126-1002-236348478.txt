 Critics laud New Theatre satire SYDNEY: The sharp political satire of New Theatre's revue "You've Never Had It So Good" is drawing a record aver- age attendance ror me theatre's St. Peter's Lane premises. As many as forty people atÂ© turned away on some nights. It is perhaps the most poli tically outspoken entertainment sver to be presented in Syd ney .-nd press and radio critics have given it high praise, most of them applauding this very aspect. Most recent comment comes from "Le Courrler Austra- nen'" which calls it the best revue Sydney has seen this year, says "it is unashamedly for Mr. Everybody, but tries none the less to illustrate his rights and abuses made of him . . ." The crowded attendance at "You've Never Had It So Good" has taken place while most organisations have been in recess and unable to arrange theatre parties. New Theatre last week urged all who wish to see the show and benefit from the re ductions for block bookings to act quickly and avoid disap pointment.
