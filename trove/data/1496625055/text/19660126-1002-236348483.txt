 US distrust of "Allies" "BACKGROUND TO VIET NAM" is the title of a book written by Bernard Newman, a critic of Washing- fcrm nnltav nn RnTifh-TJlftfit Acta. from which I quote the fol lowing extract: "It would be absurd to pre tend that the Americans have much confidence in their allies. I heard endless complaints about the inability of Vietna mese leaders, to lead. '"I blame the internal rup- tions,' said an American colonel. 'You don't find a Buddhist officer at all keen to go to the aid of a Catholic.' "'Some of these political and army chaps don't want the war to end,' another added, 'They're too well off. They'll i never have such jobs again i for the rest of their lives— or one with such opportunities for putting their hands into the till.' ' " 'But not all of them,' his -friend insisted. 'Some are good —very good.' " 'There was one colonel who never reported deserters. He kept their rations and their pay for himself.' " 'Well, this is the East. That's an old Chinese custom, isn't it?' ,;i; " 'Whatever it is, the Viet Cong don't do it. They've got the will to win — our friends haven't.'" N.N. (Fairfield).
