 DOLLARS FOR TRIB. FUND By JUNE MILLS SYDNEY: A dollar for the Tribune! There's a suggestion for o practical way to mark the currency change over on February 14. course, we know that some donors give more than that, quite reg ularly, and the suggestion came from one of them. But, as he said: "There are readers who are voicing their pleasure at the improved .Tri bune, but who don't donate to its fund. We should ask them for a dollar." The Fund total for the month of January augurs well for the future, although at this time 1965 we had received £217 odd. Let's hear from readers all over Australia and see if next month's total can beat Febru ary 1965. Donations this week: Oxford Street sellers per Bill Fitzpatrick 2/-, S. S. Griffith £1, .
