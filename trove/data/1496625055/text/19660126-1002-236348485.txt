 1 How's this for coincidence? j | Holt's uniform I didn't fit either! | There is a significant parallel between | I the careers of Menzies and his deputy, s j Holt, who meekly waited his turn for 16 I years. j | Holt is not much better | fitted than the non-vol- I unteer of 1914 to lead 8 (or push) this nation 8 into any kind of war. I We've been told at length | in recent days how he was I "manpowered" out of the I army and into the Cabinet | in 1940. | He had every chance to I rectify the situation in Oc- I tober 1941 when, by decision | of 'the people, neitheniie nor S his Prime Minister were any I longer required in the Cab- | inet. 1 But the able-bodied spear- | fisherman of military age ! didn't rejoin his old col leagues in khaki. He exer- | cised his option, which was S not open to everyone, to re- I main a civilian. When Menzies' decision to j send troops to Vietnam was j announced last year, Treas- j urer Holt, who was then I negotiating for dollars in j Wall Street, could not con- j ceal the pleasure he felt at | the smoothing of his mis- j sion. S In the Diggers for Dollars j deal, he played a. key role I with enthusiasm. I When the next election j comes, he will find the peo- ! pie also haven't forgotten his j role as the credit-squeezing j Treasurer in 1961, the man j who followed in every way ! the techniques of helping j the rich get richer, developed | by his predecessor, Fadden. I Holt may aspire to have I 16 years like his former boss, j If he gets that many months \ he will be lucky. I limn mm n M u m
