 "Satellite" city DECENTLY I went to the supposed Sydney satellite city of Mt. Drtiitt and was shocked to see just desolation everywhere— plus a few desult ory half-made roads and a handful of partly completed cottages. No sign of water, light or gas. Premier Askin has 'killed the home building on this project. Hundreds and hundreds of building workers who normally eke out a crust from the cot tage program are unemployed. It is easy to see why Askin has done this. Hundreds of so-called "home units" are on the hands of the financiers. The ordinary worker has not the finance to buy these places, (somewhat cheaply finished in most cases) and many of them are not for rental. Through your columns at least some of the workers will learn the facts.— C. Locke, Seven Hills (NSW).
