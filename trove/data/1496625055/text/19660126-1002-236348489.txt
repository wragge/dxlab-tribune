I j of schools — an innovation under the ! 1 j Askin Liberal Government. J | | The State Council of | the Miscellaneous Work- | err' Union has called the | meetings to plan action j against the Public Ser- | vice Board's decision to have several schools ! cleaned by private con- ! tractors. j Mr. K. Blackwell (N.S.W. | president of the M.W.U.) &lt; 1 said as a start the union will propose a 24-hour stop, i fV page for members of the j j union to picket schools if I | the PSB persists with its j | plans. 2 g He said the P.S.B. had j ® asked the union to confer on I this matter last week hut had j | in fact already made the de- 1 £ cision to employ contractors,! to clean nine schools in Syd- 1 ney, one in Wollongong and three in Newcastle. I "Hostility" j | Mr. K. Wilson (M.W.U. sec- 1 retary in Newcastle) said = there was strong hostility! | among women in Newcastle | against the Government's ac- j 4 tion. | Mr. Wilson said it would | worsen wages and conditions j by: I Reducing annual leave | from four weeks to three j &lt; weeks. j Reducing sick leave from ! two weeks to one week. | Abolishing increment ser- 1 vice allowances which vary j from 4/- to 12/- a week. j Extending working hours | from 33 to 36 hours for fe- males and could mean refifc j troduction of Saturday morn- j ing work. j Abolishing preferences to I ' women which include those in I t receipt of State aid and! widows and others in needy j circumstances. ! Under the present female j || school cleaning agreement, | widows in receipt of State aid ! and other needy people have a I preference to do this work. | Contractors would not be | bound to observe this agree- ! ment. p Sth.
