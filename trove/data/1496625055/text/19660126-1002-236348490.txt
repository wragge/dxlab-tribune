 [?] The cent is too dear for pensioners PENSIONERS will .be j hardest hit, not only by the continuing rising cost of living, but by the facts of the decimal cur- V ' 7. rency changeover. Because they live on a . razor edge of poverty, pensioners gen erally buy food and other ne cessities in smaller quantities than any other section of the people. . At present the shilling can be divided exactly into 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 arid 24 equal parts, whereas 10 cents can only be divided into 2, 5 and 10 equal parts. This means the pensioner's budgeting will be more costly. Subh items as fruit are com monly priced in bulk, but with pence and ha-pence it is possible to, buy one piece without losing money. For example, where oranges are 3 for 1/-, a pension er can buy one for 4d. But with decimals, this would become 3 for 10c, and a single orange would become 4 cents (4.8d). If this happened five days a week, it is an extra 4d. This is quite apart from the considerable effect of profiteer ing price rises already so wide spread under cover of the changeover. . Anyone who doubts the ne cessity for a pensioner to pinch and scrape may be interested to know that the best I can manage for a main meal usually is brown rice (unpolished) with vegetable curry; for small meals chapatties with margar ine, jam, or raisins soaked over night in water. I cannot, afford to drink, smoke or go to the pictures. My Christmas dinner was brown rice and mince curry. â€” Charters Towers &lt;Q.).
