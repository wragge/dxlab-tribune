 Following the pattern AS an old-timer and one of the oldest subscribers to your paper â€” the only paper In NSW that Is honest and sup- ports the workers, I ask for space for a few lines. Maybe I live in the past, but from the past we get history and from history sound know ledge. I refer now to the role of the United States. At the end of World War 2, in China they tried to bolster up Chiang Kai-Shek, the enemy of the Chinese people. This would have been a great harvest for the Yanks if they could have done this, and they would have been assured of profits for life. Now they are waging an aggressive, cowardly war against the people of Vietnam, who do not want violence but want to settle differences with the American puppet govern ment. It is cowardly, because the US, with their vast number of planes, use of gas and napalm, rain death on men, women and children alike. The USA action in this war is the same old pattern. They push in men and machines to save the profits of a gang of millionaires. The working people in America make the ships and planes and feed the war machines from their wages' tax. One might ask what are a few thousand or even a million lives to the warmongers? O. R. HILLING (Normanhurst).
