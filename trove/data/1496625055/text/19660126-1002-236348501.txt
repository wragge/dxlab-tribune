 NEW PRICE RISES | SEND WAGE CLAIMS UP I Unions move to offset | higher living costs j ! By an Industrial Correspondent j ! SYDNEY : The Australian Council of Trade Unions' claim | for increased basic wage rates has been amended upwards to j cover further price rises for the quarter ended Dec. 1965, plus j another 1/- for productivity. | i Consumer Price Index figures for that quarter show the need to increase the rates claimed by the following amounts: Sydney 4/-, Melbourne 4/-, Adelaide 5/-, Brisbane 4/-, Perth 4/-, Hobart 5,/-, 6 Capital Cities average 4/-. The following table shows the claims, amended to cover the December price rises, the currant rates and the increases claimed:—— Current Basic Wage Claim Increase Sydney £15 15 0 £17 17 0 ($35.70) £2 2 0 ($4.20) Melbourne 15 7 0 17 11 0 ($35.10) 2 4 0 ($4.40) Brisbane 14 10 0 16 14 0 ($33.40) 2 4 0 ($4.40) Adelaide 15 3 0 17 6 0 ($34.60) 2 3 0 ($4.30) Perth 15 8 0 17 5 0 ($34.50) 1 17 0 ($3.70) Hobart- 15 14 0 17 16 0 ($35.60) 2 2 0 ($4.20) 6 Capitol Cities Average 15 8 0 17 11 0 ($35.10) 2 3 0 ($4.30) The claim before the Arbitration Commission takes the form of an ap plication to vary the Fed eral Metal Trades Award. This Award does not operate j,n Perth and does not contain a rate for the 6 Capital Cities Average. Any decision by the Commis sion on this claim will affect Federal Awards which do con tain a Perth and 6 Capital Cities Average rate and the above figures show the picture with the claim applied to those rates. The Commission's decision will apply directly to nil State Awards in all States except Queensland and West Australia. The decision will provide a basis for further steps neces sary to increase the separate State basic wage still operating in those States. Basis for unions 9 claims This claim is based upon what is known as the "prices- productivity" formula with the 1964 basic wage as the starting point. (The current rates are the 1964 rates.) Of the increases sought, the following amounts are to cover price rises from and including the June, 1964, quarter: Sydney 22/-, Melbourne 24/-, Brisbane 24/-, Adelaide 23/-, Perth 18/-, Hobart 22/-, 6 Capital Cities Average 23/-. The remaining 20/- of the in crease claimed is for increased productivity in 1964 and 1965. This is estimated at 5.8 per cent, and applies to the 6 Capi tal Cities rate adjusted for price rises equals 20/-. In 1961 and 1964 increases of 52/- a week were claimed. In both those cases the "prices- productivity" formula was ap plied to the 1953 rate. That was the year in which quarterly adjustments were abolished. This formula, applied to the 1953 rates, aimed to increase the rates to the amounts they would have been if the system of quarterly adjustments had not been abolished, and then further increased to compen sate for 1 per cent, productivity rise per year. One per cent, is approximately half the esti mated annual increase in pro ductivity. If the current claims were based upon this formula they would be higher than they are. The following figures show the comparison: — Current 1 953 Basic Wage Wage Adjuste&lt; Sydney 15 15 0 16 7 Melbourne 15 7 0 17 10 Brisbane 14 10 0 15 14 Adelaide 15 3 0 16 3 Perth 15.-8 0 16 14 Hobart 15 14 0 17 10 6 Capitals 15 8 0 16 13 All this shows that the cur rent claims are justified and compared with previous claims are reasonable, because:— The current claims exceed the 1953 rates adjusted to date for price increases only by 20/- for Sydney and Brisbane, 23/- for Adelaide, 12/- for Perth, 5/- for Hobart and 18/- for the 6 Capital Cities Average, and l/ for Melbourne. 1953 Adi.

This emphasises the im portance of the ACTU call for a mass trade union campaign in support of the claims.
