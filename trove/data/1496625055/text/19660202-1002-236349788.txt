 !THEYPUfi I IT IN THE | I HONEY JAR I i i | By JUNE MILLS j £ YDNEY : Exactly 12 days from today Australian people will have decimal currency notes and coins to handle. Practically everybody expects price increases to follow and this will apply not only to families but to undertakings like production of Tribune. So this makes all the more important the proposal made by a reader last week to those who have not so far donated to the Fund. "We should ask them for a dollar." In saying this we don't want, to discourage donors who may not be able to afford a dollar — all donations are wel come. Boys on the iron-ore vessel "Iron Flinders" donated 17/2 this week. I'm told they leave a honey jar on the mess table for Tribune Fund. A good idea which might well be fob lowed, and not only on ships Thanks to all supporters who've helped us reach the total of £215 odd— just £2 less than this time last year. With co-operation from many more readers we'll surpass the total for February 1966. Donations this week: Les and Bob, street sellers, Bankstown, £1/11/6; BHP, 10/-; Kings Cross donors, 16/6; Dom. gate, 6/3; Oxford Street sellers (per Bill Fitzpatrick), 6/-; Gwen (per Bill Fitzpatrick), 5/-; "Dollar Girl," Kings Cross, 10/-; "Iron Flinders," 17/2; Pat, £7; A.H., Bondi Junction, 5/-; Zara, £4; J.H., Seamen, £1; Travellers' return, £3/2/-.
