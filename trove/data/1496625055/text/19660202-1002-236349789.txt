 WA State wage rise DERTH: The West Aus tralian State basic wage increase of 4/2 last week will be of interest to workers in other States who over recent years have been deprived of cost of living adjustments. Though there have been many indications that the State Government is moving to wipe out the principle of c.0.1. adjustments, the State Industrial Commission unani mously decided to lift the State wage by 4/2 to £16/3/9 (male) and £12/2/10 (female), or 15/9 higher than the Federal basic wage. In effect, the Commission's decision blamed Government levies. The main c.o.l. rises on which the new wage is based were in petrol, cigarettes, tobacco, beer and fares. Most of the recent increases have been direct results of higher taxation in the latest Federal and State budgets. The anomalous position now exists that workers in WA on the Federal basic wage (whar- fies, shipwrights, tally clerks, etc.) now get 15/9 less than their fellow workers on a State award— an unjustifiable wage robbery.
