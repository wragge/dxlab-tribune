 French police scandal over kidnap plot From DENNIS FRANCIS in Paris pAKIa: r ranee has been rocked over tne past few days by a scandal on the scale | of the famous Dreyfus Case. I Several of the parallel security police services t. have been clearly involved | in the kidnapping and p murder of Moroccan left- ? wing leader Mehdi Ben Barka. De Gaulle has been forced tc $ dismiss his two top security men while several members oi his government including In terior Minister Roger Frey are widely believed involved. 1 De Gaulle has also been forced to issue an international j arrest warrant against the Moroccan Interior Minister f General Oufkir who" is reported | to have personally tortured Ben ! Barka. |; In May 1965 French security \ police knew of a plan to kid- nap Ben Barka, worked out by General Oufkir. October 28: Lopez, a security j j agent involved in the kidnap, told his . chief that Ben Barka would be kidnapped the next _ day. October 29: Ben Barka was: persuaded in the middle of Paris at midday to enter a car . by two French security police- ; men, after they had shown him,., their cards. Next day: . Oufkir arrived in; Paris, went to the gangster's ; home tortured and probably killed Ben Barka with his own hands. The French security police knew all and sanctioned all! November 3: Nearly all police services knew the truth. Dlimi and Moroccan security chief Chtouki were in Paris until November 5. Oufkir returned to Paris on November 4 and even lunched with high-ranking French police officers! As the scandal has finally burst into the open, two questions are being asked: how many well-known, and lesser- known persons were involved, and why was the whole affair hushed up? It was not by accident that . the hushing-up coincided with the French Presidential election. Obviously such a scandal would have gravely affected de Gaulle's hopes in December last.
