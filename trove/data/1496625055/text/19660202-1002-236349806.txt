 The Holt Cabinet \ 3 I ! I _ 1 I Below the surface i I i j strong conflicts I I l 8 &lt; I ! By the Parliamentary Roundsman S I 2 II I CANBERRA: The new Prime Minister Mr. Holt said last week j that the people will be watching his new Cabinet â€” but it is J also certain that Cabinet members will be watching each other. j o | There are conflicts I and tensions hidden in j this Cabinet, and when j Mr. Holt said "new j Cabinet Ministers must regard themselves as | being on trial," he was j foreshadowing possible | changes yet to come. 1 It is no secret in Parlia- I mentary circles that Mr. j Holt didn't want Mr. W. | McMahon to win the position S as Deputy Leader of the j Parliamentary Liberal Party, I for this meant that he had ! to get the Treasurership, \ the number three Cabniet | position, | Mr. McMahon, former S Minister for Labor and j National Service, wields con- | siderable influence in the j NSW Liberal Party. 1 McMahon | down to size i With the support of 19 ! NSW Senators and MHR's | he defeated Mr. P. Hasluck. i for the position of Deputy ! Leader. Mr. McMahon, a most ambitious man, was already | breathing down Mr. Holt's neck when the Prime Mini- | ster held the Treasury port- | folio. ( fore wasted no time in I taking steps to cut Mc- Mahon down to size. In the last Cabinet Mr. j Holt was not only Treasurer, | but also Minister in charge of the House. | In the new Cabinet Mr. j McMahon holds only the ! Treasurership, with Mr. I Fairbairn taking over Mr. j Holt's former position as | Leader of the House, as well ? as being Minister of National I Development. | Minister in Charge of the j House is a very important position. It enables the j holder to extend his con- I tacts with every Liberal I MHR and Government de- | partment. | Howson is i watchman | It includes supervising the j conduct of debates, liaison J with Government depart- 1 ments to ensure a regular | flow of legislation and co- j operation with the Govern- | ment and Opposition Whips J to ensure supply of speakers, j A further step has been j the appoinmtent of Mr. P. j | Howson not only as Minister j I for Air, but also Minister | j assisting the Treasurer. j _ Howson, who is a very I important man in the Liberal | Party machine in Victoria j (Mr. Holt's home State) and = a big money-raiser for the j party, has thus been placed | where he can keep a close j eye on Mr. McMahon. ! . ..r" fury's promotion to j Minister for Labor and National Service is a reward I for his past services to the I Prime Minister. ) It is generally accepted that his attack some years ago on the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr. M c E w e n, (which cost Mr. Bury his position in Cabinet), was at the behest of Mr. Holt. Mr. Bury's attack on Mr. McEwen for his opposition to the Common Market was a weapon in the then devel oping fight between Liberals and Country Party. At that time Mr. McEwen was a contender against Men- zies as leader of the coalition parties m the Government, y I Mr. Holt had lost consider- | able support within the | j Liberal Party following the | disastrous credit squeeze. j Mr. Bury's old job, Hous- j ing, has gone to that bright = new image of the Liberal f Party, the 57-year-old Sena- j tor, Dame Annabelle Rankin, j Bows to Queensland j Mr. Holt, who has said ! that any government that j allows unemployment of j more than 2J per cent, to I develop will be defeated, I knows that unemployment j in Queensland has increased | to 3 per cent, and that there are five registered unem- ! ployed males for every S vacancy on the books of 9 the Labor Bureaus. g The unemployment posi- j tion in Queensland today is j comparable to the situation (j there in December, 1961, | when the Liberals received a ! trouncing, losing many seats. | The Dame's Cabinet ap- j pointment is aimed at trying | to show the Queensland 1 electors that the Government j cares what is happening in a that State. 1 The grim and dismal Post- j master-General Hulme was j for a time well in the run- g ning for the Defence port- 1 folio, with the solid backing | of Mr. Holt, but the Prime I Minister found opposition | toe widespread. 1 As compensation, he pro- | moted Mr. Hulme to Vice- f President of the Executive 1 Council. I Mr Hulme's main claim to j am 2 is that he is a big wheel j c c in the Queensland Party and I also the Party contact with j the Government. j Mr. Hulme is, however, j on the Defence Committee, j giving Mr. Holt a supporter I in an area with which he is | unfamiliar. | It should not be discounted : that Mr. Hulme may be ! being groomed by Mr. Holt | as a future Minister for J Defence or even Treasurer. j Stormy i weather j Mr. Swartz, the undistin- | guished Minister for Health j in the last Cabinet, has been j promoted to the portfolio of ? Civil Aviation. This, too, is ) because of the serious posi- 2 tion the Government is fac- I ing in Queensland. | The forecast is for stormy | weather. | Past : events are strewn ' g with bitter conflict between Mr. Holt and Mr. McEwen j and their different Depart- | ments, Even if they could S now get on like a house on | fire, the differences between the Liberal and Country = Parties are growing too g strong for ' the making of | stable government. j
