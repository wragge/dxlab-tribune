 I Washington liedj ? about Bay of j j Pigs fiasco j | ARTHUR SCHLESINGER, top ranking 1 aide to the late President Kennedy, had | admitted he lied to the American public 1 during the Bay of Pigs Cuba crisis in 1961. 1 Reviewing Schlesinger's book, A Thousand Days, in the London New Statesman, Conor Cruise O'Brien notes that what Schlesinger says about the invasion in his book doesn't square with what he was saying at the time. O'Brien recalls that the New York Times challenged Schles inger on this and Schlesinger admitted that he had lied to the American public, during the abortive Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba by US-backed mercen aries, about the scale and nature of the operation. "He did so in the national in terest, of course, but the trouble about that is that one never knows when the national inter- I est may not again require such | a sacrifice," says O'Brien. | Accusing Schlesinger of having | spread a "miasma of men- I dacity", O'Brien notes Schles- I inger's admission that during | the Bay of Pigs invasion, Cuban I emigre chiefs were locked up in an airbase while two Latin A American "experts" from Har- A vard, selected by Schlesinger, % wrote "communiques" purport ing to come from them. | Schlesinger quotes an ad- mission by Kennedy which has been since ignored by Johnson and Rusk: "The war in Vietnam could only be won only so long as it was their war. If it were ever converted into a white man's war we would lose it as the French had lost a decade | earlier". i M
