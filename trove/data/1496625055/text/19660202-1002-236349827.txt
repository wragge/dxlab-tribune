 Overpaid politicians WHAT do I think of Mr. Menzies retirement? It's one of the best things that has happened, although I do not anticipate that Mr. Holt's Government will have any dif ferent policy. These politicians are overpaid and underworked. They author ise a petty £6 or £6/10/- a week to the aged while they live themselves off the fat of the land. The pension received by the aged compares more than un- favorably with the £4900 pen sion received by the retiring Prime Minister. Not only do they pay pen sioners such a pittance, they try their best to keep wages as low as possible and at the same time send young Austra lians to fight in an- oppressive war against the people of Viet nam.
