 Horrors of war "THE Cruel Sea", a film of World War 2 based on the book by Nicholas Mont- serrat was shown in Sydney on ABN Channel 2 last Thurs day. This film, well-produced and acted, revealed many of the horrors of war; the heroes were shown as ordinary people with fears of what would happen to them . . . their loathing of war which forced them to kill the enemy who are "men like us", and watch their own country men drown in order to blow up an enemy U boat. While watching the film which showed corvettes and U boats used during the last war, see ing the type of weapons used, my mind turned to the new weapons being used today in Vietnam by the Americans and those weapons already develop ed and not yet used. I thought of the statement made by US Defence Secretary, Mr. McNamara (SMH 7.1.66) "America's strategic missiles alone could destroy Russia and China even in the event of a surprise attack." How much more terrible could a third world war. be un less the peace-loving people of the world force their will on those who would start that war? Congratulations to Channel 2 for showing "The Cruel Sea". My hope is that many people who watched it will be revolted against what is happening in Vietnam and be inspired to assist the cause of peace. June Galloway, North Sydney, (N.S.W.)
