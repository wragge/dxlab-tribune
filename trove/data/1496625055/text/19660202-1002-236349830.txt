 Pensioners1 paucity JSN'T it time the Govern ment did something to stabilise prices and give wages generally and pensions partic ularly a decent lift? After paying legitimate com mitmentsâ€”electricity, gas, rates, rents, maintenance, insurance and maybe a lay-by, pensioners have very little to pay for food, clothes, fares and repairs. The amount left over -is cer tainly not enough to buy suffi cient nourishing food. While some pensioners look well, many doctors will admit that in a number of cases their sickness is caused through in sufficient suitable food. On those little outings pen sioners liked to take on Govern ment buses (mainly to do some shopping and not have to carry too much at once) they can now receive a return ticket for one section, provided they use the return on the same day. However, not too many pen sioners realise they can obtain a return ticket and unless ad vised by the conductor they pay 6d each way. Food and other necessities for the family, already exorbitant, will have to be jumped up to the nearest value in cents, as in the case of butter. Decimal currency will certainly add to the cost of living. I ask is the treatment of pen sioners fair after a lifetime of decent citizenship? E. Leahy, Ramsgate (N.S.W.)
