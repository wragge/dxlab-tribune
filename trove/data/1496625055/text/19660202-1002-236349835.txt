 [?] Public men maligned in DLP poison sheets rOCUMENTS circulating in the Mackay (Qld.) district by post, without any signature, are evident- ly part of a slander campaign . against public figures being run by the Democratic Labor Party and other organs associated with the right-wing ex tremist B. A. - Santamaria. The documents in roneoed form have, as their only author isation, the works "Written by D.L.P. voters, unofficially". One of the documents sets out to be a "White Paper show ing communist activity in Aus tralia". ... , It criticises the Federal Gov- I eminent for its failure to pub- I lish such a White Paper, claim- | ing that this is because the I Government fears to jeopardise | present Australian trade with | the Soviet Union and China. g It then actually uses the | words: "DO IT YOURSELF. I Make your own White Paper." I There is an attached sample I which names 15 trade union I leaders, several of whom (in cluding ACTU Secretary Souter) are Labor Party men, and also other figures including Dr. J. Cairns, Professors E. Wheel wright, W. Ghristenson and A. Alexander of Sydney University, and Victorian ALP leaders. | All this is done in such a way » as to suggest that these are all I part of a "communist conspir acy", a "threat within", "sub version and sabotage." Another of the documents launches a sweeping attack on ' all . Australian journalists and newspapers for publishing "Sov iet and Chinese lies, and threats ... with respectful attention". It adds: "Communist perver sion of thought and deed, that is what the Press brings you." But there is one exception — Santamaria's News-Weekly, which is given a plug, together with its postal address, as the paper that "will give you, week by week the names and posi tions of communists, their ac tivities and their motives." It looks as though Santamaria and his lieutenants are afraid to put their names on their more unscrupulous propaganda. J. G. (Mackay)
