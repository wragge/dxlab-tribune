 It went round the crib room From Tribune Editorial As the miners of Nebo pit, on the New South Wales South Coast, sat and talked in their crib roum, the new Tribune was passed around. There was a lot of com ment. Some liked this, some that, some things were criti cised. There was the view that the whole back page should be a sports article and a big sports picture. Some wanted only one story on the front page. But all thought it was much im proved. One miner who does not buy the paper said: "Now it looks like a first-class paper." This was one story told when five workers from the New South Wales South Coast walked into Tribune office the other day, sat down, and said: "We've formed a committee to build Tribune's circulation on the Coast." They wanted facts about the past development of Tribune, and about its present produc tion and distribution. They are aiming to lift the circulation of Tribune during 1966 by about 20 per cent, in their area. Here are the first steps they are taking: Arranging for each branch of the Communist Party to appoint a member with respon sibility for organismg a sales drive. Eliminating back debts, where they exist, by special money raising. Developing the method of payment in advance by those in charge of distribution in the various localities. The weekly order has in creased by 26 at Broken Hill (NSW) since the new Tribune was issued. gOUTH Coast (NSW) Tribune sales organisers have a look at the new machine that prints Tribune.
