 Festival for children DERTH : One young woman by inspiring a group of men and women to assist her has brought into being an organisation — Children's Activities Times Society — which offers children holiday activities and experiences in creative art. CATS is the creation of Mrs. Joan Pope, -who explains that activities are arranged for children of many different age groups, from the very small three to four-year-olds up to the 15-year-olds. The present Festival, current ly running in Perth and suburbs during the last four weeks of the school holidays, offers poetry reading, programmes of dance, musical appreciation, puppets and stories. These programmes use pro- fessional artists, who are paid for their services, but who are willing to work for the lowest possible amount. Creative activities are also provided and children paint, model in clay, explore musical instruments with the' help of musicians, act in their own plays and make puppets. "We want the children to find out what they like themselves," said Mrs. Pope, "we don't mind if they say they liked the prog ramme on Tuesday better than the one on Thursday. In this way they express themselves." "The finance is a worry though, we charge the very min imum and our expenses are high, printing alone will prob ably run to £200. It would be easy to add a few more to each group but this would destroy the personal touch." The outstanding success of the CATS Festivals highlights the need for such activities, which must be given govern ment financial backing, without restrictive strings.
