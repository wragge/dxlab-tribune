 Local protests win respite from garbage tip JYDNEY : Widespread protest action by Ryde residents has forced the Ryde Council to back down on a proposal to turn 56 acres of natural bushlands into a rubbish tip. More than 2&lt;0O people crowded the public gallery of Ryde Council Chambers on Wednesday last week to protest against the proposal. At the meeting, the Council decided to: 1. Seek further negotiations . . with Kuringai and Parra- matta Councils to take Hyde's putrescible ma terial. 2. Conduct a speedy investi gation of costs and effi ciency of incineration. 3. Approach the State Gov ernment on the feasibility of cheap freighting com pact garbage to suitable country spots. 4. Request the State Govern ment to set up a Regional Authority to solve the ur gent problem for disposing of putrescible garbage now common to many Councils. These decisions, though not finally disposing of the threat of the earlier tipping proposal, represent a substantial victory (or the ratepayers concerned. They have won the "first round." The Mayor told the meeting that 14 telegrams, 45 letters; a petition signed by over 300 people and many telephone calls of protest had been received by Council. Other Councillors said they, too, had received scores of protests. The Mayor said he had up to 60 letters addressed to him personally. Information before Council showed that the Municipalities of Concord, Burwood, Ashfield, Auburn, Drummoyne and Hun ters Hill are facing similar problems. Reference was made by one Councillor to a report prepared by the old Cumberland County Council planning Authority placing 1970 as the deadline for solving this problem, as by then no suitable tipping areas would be left. Thus the Ryde proposal for a Regional Authority has wide implications. The problem of Council f',nance was always present in Council discussions. Ryde Council is reflecting the "Battle of the Rates!' in the fact that so far it has not yet finally agreed on the rate to be struck.
