 Big response to the new Tribune By JUNE MILLS SYDNEY: Our appeal for more donations to support the improved Tribune has brought a great response — - this week's £94/16/- is the best tally of small donations ror many years. One worth particular mention is £30 from "the Murphies" — man and wife who, while old friends of the movement, could not have made such a donation without sacrifice. In another case OG handed £10 to a regular seller in ap preciation. Now the job is to keep it up. Some readers have expressed surprise and great pleasure that, in spite of the difficulties of maintaining an independent newspaper of the working peo ple, it is possible to bring about such major improvements. The fact is that higher qual ity costs money and will con tinue to do so. So don't forget our latest call for a "Dollar for Tribune" with the currency changeover. How many can take a leaf out of the book of "Malay" (per Butch Wharton, Newcastle) who last week drew £1 from his pay envelope, saying: "There's no more overtime at work, so that knocks my new motor bike idea on the head; here's something to help keep the paper going." He's a family man, too.
