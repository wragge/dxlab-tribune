 Unions' claims for wage margins rises By an Industrial Correspondent JYDNEY : In addition to claims for in creases in the basic wage rates and maintenance of their purchasing power by the restoration of the quarterly adjustments, the Australian Council of Trade Unions is also seeking increases in margins. Arbitration Commission president Judge Kirby, has decided that both the unions' margins claim and the margins issues involved in the employers' claims will be dealt with by a full Bench which could in clude Conciliation Commissioner Winter. If Commissioner Winter is included on the Full Bench dealing with margins this will mean two Full Benches deal ing with the three claims by the unions and employers since only judges can deal with basic wage claims. Judge Kirby has also decided that all three claims covering the basic wage and margins will be dealt with at a hearing to commence, at a time and place he will announce on or shortly after February 15. This will mean a hearing com mencing sometime in March. He will nominate the mem bers of the Commission to hear the' claims only shortly before the hearing commences. The unions' margins claim is aimed at restoring the purchas ing power of the relativity be tween margins and the 1947 level. This claim takes the form of an application to vary the Metal Trades Award by increasing the margin for an electrical fitter. However the claim will be argued as an application to in crease all margins in the Metal Trades Award. The decision in this matter will provide the basis for affecting margins m all awards. Some indications of the claims and increases sought by the unions can be gained by the application of the 1947 standards to margins covering some classi fications in the Metal Trades Award. The following table shows for certain classifications their 1947 margin, current margin, the margin being claimed, the per centage of the relevant basic wage and the increase sought. Some idea of what the com bined basic wage and margins claims amount to can be gather- ed from examples taken from the Metal Trades Award. The differences in the in creases in the amounts for the same classification in different cities is due to variations in the basic wage claim for each city. £ W o c CQ »-» d T3 C mT - C O 21 £« | Classification J \ J £|2 10 n s 58 5 Sjs s 5 o Q) to c u.
