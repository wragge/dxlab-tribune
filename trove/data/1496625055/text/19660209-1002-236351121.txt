 Broken Hill people beat petrol rise By the Industrial Roundsman QROKEjN HILL: About 98 per cent of Broken Hill's population responded last week to the Barrier Industrial Council's black ban on petrol stations selling higher priced petrol. This fact is disclosed by a Tribune correspondent at Broken Hill who said this strong action causedj proprietors to cave in and reduce prices by 2d a gallon. Earlier the proprietors said they had no intention of sur rendering to union demands. The ban was imposed on, 27 of Broken Hill's 29 petrol stations, where the retail price of petrol was increased from 4d to 6d a gallon above the Sydney price. The BIC instructed all unionists, who comprise 25 per cent, of the population, not to buy or serve petrol at the higher price, or transport petrol to stations selling at the higher price. The dispute followed the lifting of price control on petrol in Broken Hill by the NSW Prices Commissioner. The lesson from the action at Broken Hill should be of value to unionists throughout Australia. It shows the kind of decisive action that gets quick results against rising prices. It shows that when the unions take a stand they will get overwhelming support from the public. Looking at other prices A Prices Committee now set up by the BIC is examining other price increases which include milk, bread and bus fares. Already the committee has moved against the Id a pint increase of milk, making it 5d a pint dearer than in Adelaide. Milk vendors have been asked to put prices back to the old level pending discus sions with them. "Appropriate action" will be taken failing satisfaction from the vendors. During last week's petrol dispute the local prices authority had refused to dis cuss the matter with the BIC. Now the State Minister for Labor and Industry (Mr. Willis) has given the BIC per mission to attend all future meetings of the local authority.
