 Tribune cartoon COME WHAT belatedly I of- fer my congratulations on the cartoon "Dear Santa . . ." which appeared in the Xmas issue of Tribune. I've shown it to dozens of peopleâ€” in cafes, shops, offices, and on buses. From young and old came delighted guffaws. It must surely have stimulated sales for that particular issue of Trib. I still have it pinned on the wall at work, where it gains unwilling grins even from our pro-Menzies executives; but they still get the message. Bee Jay, Glebe (N.S.W.)
