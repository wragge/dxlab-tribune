 On the NG waterfront FOR 14 HOURS! vr J PORT MORESBY: Waterside workers here, like their Aus- | tralian counterparts begin their working day at 8 a.m., but I here all similarity in working conditions ends. 1 While the conditions of 1 Australian wharfies leave much to be desired the $ conditions of wharfies in |j " apua-New Guinea, can M 9nly be described as i deplorable. In Port Moresby a watersider | wprks from 8 a.m. till 10 p.m., I with two one-hour breaks be- | ween noon and 1 p.m. and 6 P.m. and 7 p.m. They are paid no meal t£ney, but are dependent on I !ne generosity of the employer for a meal. 1 v, i?8 i|S one tin of corned H Deef and a half-loaf of dry bread between two men. Wages are from 3/- to 4/- per hour. There are no safety regulations or inspections of ship's gear. Most of the white foremen treat the workers like slaves and sling loads are determined on how fast they want the ship discharged or loaded. In Lae the hours are from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., with two meal hours and no "smokos" at £1/10/- a day. In Madang it's 8 a.m. to midnight with the same breaks, and the pay is £1/4/- a shift.. At Lorengau the rate is £1 for a day of 10 hours. At Kavieng they are paid £1 for 12 hours. Normal amenities are non existent. There is no wet weather clothing, no washing time, no cool water taps in the scorching heat. But it is noticeable that as the men climb the gangway to start work only a few of them will be heard to use the old words of colonial servitude: "Good morning, master." And even these workers don't use it with the servility of the past. Once the habit is broken it seldom returns. It is yet another reflection of the de mand for independence and an end to bad conditions.
