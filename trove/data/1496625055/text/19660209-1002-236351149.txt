 More price robbery HHBnwBni AA7HEN the price of wheat dropped 1/5 a bushel a few years ago, bakers dropped the price of bread by a halfpenny a loaf. Now the price of wheat has gone up 8d. a bushel, the price of bread went up Id. per two-pound loaf. In my time in the milling trade a miller used to get 401b. flour, 181b. offal and 21b. waste per bushel of wheat, and I am informed that a baker gets 23 loaves out of a bushel of wheat. The extra penny on these will give either the baker or the miller 1/11, against an increase of only 8d. per bushel of wheat. Why t the penny in crease in the two-pound loaf? Another matter is about the big oil grab— id. gal. increase to pay the little extra wages that seamen won from Am- pol. The 32,000-ton "P. G. Adams" has a capacity of 8 million gallons. At a half penny a gallon increase, that gives a total of £16,666/13/4 per trip extra. I wonder if the crew will get that much increase per trip? H. J. Wells, Rosewater (SA).
