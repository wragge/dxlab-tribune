 Australian and US troops LAST week on News Review (Channel 2) I watched an American reporter interview ing soldiers in Vietnam. it appeared the aim of the questions, asked was to show close relations between Aus tralian and American soldiers. The American interviewer worked hard to have the Australians praise the US soldiers, but some rather trenchant criticisms were contained in the Australian's replies. The main trend was to show that the US soldiers did not take enough care to avoid alerting the Vietnamese soldiers. The US soldiers have radios playing loudly; they make too much noise. And other comments along these lines showed that all was not 100 per cent, in relationships. This film was shown twice on the one night and I won dered whether there was any connection between it and the report in the Sydney press about the soldier, now an adjutant at Duntroon Mili tary College, who on his return from Vietnam had been prevented from speaking to the press in the interesi Of good relations between Australia and the US?
