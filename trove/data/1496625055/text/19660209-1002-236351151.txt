 Tribune's new look QONGRATULATIONS on the new-look Tribune, which is certainly a great improvement in appearance and technique on the old one. The printing is clearer and every word can be read, and our sellers can now welcome comparisons between Tribune and other papers in appear ance. The content of Tribune was always better. I feel that the heading would be improved if it did not stand alone and, if pos sible, I would like to see the outline of Australia in it, similar to the old name. H. Rees.Como (NSW).
