 Appreciation of P. Nicholls nwwnngmrimrwirmimTimffWTTirriTiTTTiiTmn rPHE many friends of Dick Nicholls will be saddened by his recent death in Sydney at the age of 79. Dick, who was born in Australia, went to England as a child when his parents left Australia, following the effects of the disastrous 1891 depression. He grew up in Oxford and served his appren ticeship as a moulder, work ing for some of the then new car manufacturers of Eng land. As a young man, he subsequently returned to Australia. After many years away from iron moulding, he re turned to it during World War II, working for Bradford Kendall, where he stayed till his retirement. With his working-class back ground and his ability to "think things out," it is not t surprising that Dick became a Communist. At the time of ? his death, he had been a ! member of the Communist Party for well over 20 years, j At Bradford Kehdall, Dick j became known as an ace j Tribune seller, and after his | retirement he became . litera- | ture organiser for his party branch. Many of us remem- I ber him as a vital, driving j force in getting the literature j out and sold. ! During the 1951 referendum, ! Dick's planning of the distri- I bution of the thousands of I leaflets by the local branch 1 was a model of efficiency. I 1 well remember, too, his joy | and elation when the over- | whelming "No" vote was cast. ! Dick died after being sick 1 for some years, and during I this time his wife Dot cared j for him and nursed him with an unwavering devotion. Our 1 sympathy goes to Dot at this I time. 9 R.T., Sydney (NSW). I
