 [?] Many postal charges are going up on C-Day IT appears 1 that con trary to published statements made by the P.M.G spokesman, a substantial rise in postal charges will take place on and after C-Day. The present initial charges, of course, will be converted accurately into decimals, but it is when the "additional ounces" charge is converted that graduation to a higher decimal takes place. For letters, lettercards and postcards and other articles there is an increase of one cent compared to the old rate. Poundage on 3/- and 4/6 postal notes will be in creased by one cent. Overseas airmail rates will increase by up to five cents and for parcels sent by air mail the increase in some cases is up by 20c. Cynically, I note that the rates for bulk newspapers and demurrage (harges are to remain the same, but of course such services are not used by the general public, but mainly business con cerns.
