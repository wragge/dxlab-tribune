 Wins his job back CYDNEY, After six months of public pro test and agitation the Sutherland Shire Council has voted to re.nsiare 11s Chief Engineer, Mr. F. L. Wood. He was dismissed six months ago for allegedly failing to co operate with the Council, but a Local Government inquiry found that the allegations were not justified. Last Tuesday the Council created a new position for Mr. K. P. O'Connell, the engineer who had replaced Mr. Wood, so Mr. Wood could apply for his old job back. Later Mr. O'Connell said he did not want to work at the new post and would remain as engineer. At last Friday's meeting of the Council, Councillor Bates, the shire president, at the time of Mr. Wood's dismissal, moved a rescission motion. He said that as Mr. O'Con nell wanted to keep the engi neer's job there was no vacancy to be discussed.. This was defeated by eight votes to seven.
