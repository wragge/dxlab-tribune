 ACSPA asks Govt, to end wage discrimination SYDNEY: The N.S.W. Division of the Australian Council of Salaried and Pro fessional Associations last week called on the State Liberal Government to end wage discrimination against N.S.W. public servants. The N.S.W. Public Service Board late last year refused to # apply the per cent decision of the Commonwealth Arbitration Commission to public servants, including teachers, school inspectors, nurses, clerks and police. A deputation from the Public Service Association, Teachers' Federation, Police Association and Professional Officers' Association met Premier Askin on January 28 over this issue. The deputation was told to have further talks with the PSB. The decision of the Board to increase public servants' salaries by 6/- a week fo; men and 4/6 for women has caused wide hostility. In most cases this is below the 14 per cent decision which the State Industrial Commisa- ion recently extended to State Awards. Had this smal increase applied, teachers for example would have received) from £18 to £54 a year increase as against the £15/12/- now offered) by tihe Board. The economy drive being currently carried out by the NSW Government and PSB in the field of public educat ion was also opposed by ACSPA as "detrimental to the people of this State." This drive is seen in the cut in the school building program, in the rejection of thousands of qualified appli cants for teachers' college scholarships and in the State wide cut in the services pro vided by needlework teachers, a resolution said. The State Government is urged by ACSPA to make "Strenuous efforts to secure adequate funds from the Fed eral Government to provide arid maintain at a proper level education and other public services.
