 Air pollution a health hazard for Perth residents By our W.A. Correspondent PERTH: Only strong action, taken quick ly can prevent present air pollution from the Kwinana industrial area, affecting not only nearby residential areas but the whole of Perth. Overseas experience has shown that only punitive measures against industrialists brought results. If industries refuse to insfal the expensive controls needed, they should be sited elsewhere.

It drives house wives to distraction, but its, effect on health is not even known publicly. Latest report of the W.A.

The State Government appointed a 14,-member Ajir Pollution Control Council last year, concentrating control previously spread over five government departments.

Curran MLA (Cock- burn) took a petition to a joint meeting of three shire councils concerned1, at which Premier Brand was present.
