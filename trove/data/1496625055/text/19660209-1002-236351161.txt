Singleton army camp. j Previous demonstrations f | had attracted wide pub- j | licity. > I Evidently fearing the ef- | fects on public opinion, the !Army Department switch ed arrangements at the last minute last week, send ing the conscripts off by bus. Learning this, the demon- | strators held a mass meet- I ing in Belmore Park beside I the station. After the cards S were bumed, demonstra- | tors marched through the ! station with their placards. I About 100 of the demon- strators then marched to Sydney stadium where Superama 66, a vaudeville show, was taking place. The demonstrators, won considerable support and sympathy among the crowd for the slogan: "Show the boys we really care, bring them back from over there". ABOVE: Three draftees burn their cards.
