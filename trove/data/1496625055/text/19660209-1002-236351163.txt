 I '' - j«— . n n ii — ii — — n |, j SPJffiTS — J j N.Z. Govt, j | sets example j | for Australia j j By THE CHALLENGER | The statement last week by the New j j Zealand Prime Minister, Mr. Holyoake> j j that his government would hack any j j N.Z. sporting team regardless of colour l \ is a good lead that should be followed j I by the Australian Prime Minister, Mr. j j Holt, and the government. | | The Government would oppose any bid to | 1 have an all white N.Z. Rugby Union team j ! selected, to tour South Africa next year. j I | Mr. Holyoake is report- I ed as saying that "where | important moral issues are | involved— fundamental to out national integrity— the | government has a duty to | state clearly the principles S which in its view New Zea- I landers should observe at 1 home and abroad." | Does not this apply to Aus- S tralia also? j It certainly should, but it j has remained up to Austra- J lian labor and youth move- j ments to give the lead re- 1 araTrHna1 a nloar etafpmAnf. nf I j Australian opposition to ra- 1 cialism or any form of dis- 1 I crimination. I | The N.Z. government and j the N.Z. Federation of Labor g now express harmonious | views regarding the N.Z. at- titude to racialism. | In view of the future pos- 1 j sible discrimination in Aus- 1 \ tralia regarding any sport g j with South Africa (the Gra- g ham Thomas cricket episode I I being a recent example) it | j is about time that the Fed- g eral government aligned it- S I self with the vlfews of the 8 !: Australian people, and out- g rightly condemned racialism. | This then would provide I I the lead upon which indivi- g j dual sporting bodies could g act. Any decisions contrary g | to this would correctly be | = called anti-social and indeed g j anti-Australian. | | Age is j j no bar! j i DOY EMERSON'S splen- j | did 3-1 win over Amer- I J ica's Arthur Ashe last j week in the final of the j 8 Australian tennis champ- i i ionships was a convincing j g reminder that the person g 8 nearing the 30 mark can I in no way be considered | | over the hill. On the con- | ! trary, sportsmen can be 1 I considered to be at their j top, at this age. j Emerson is 29 and Ashe 22. g The tendency of the ex- j perts is to favour the young- i er person when making fore- | casts in competitions be- I I tween younger and relatively I j older competitors. j | One reason for this is not I so much that the older per- ! son is not as good physically j g as a younger person, but that g | his or her mental approach | i suffers from a greater pos- j g sible lack of interest. g I In the Soviet Union pub- I g lication, "No Limits To I g Strength and Skill" author g | Alexander Svetov says: g 8 "We believe that in a 8 i future society, man will be g at the zenity of his strength j ! and health at the age of forty ! I and fifty. People will be go- f g ing in for sport until they g ! reach a ripe old age. And j I they will enter competition I g and show good results." j | Many people certainly hope I ! so. I
