 NEWCASTLE Unions protest at rate rise NEWCASTLE: The Trades Hall Council last week protested against a proposal by Newcastle City Council s Town Clerk (Mr. Burgess) to increase 1966 rates by 13 per cent. A strong protest nas oeen forwarded to the Lord Mayor of Newcastle and the Presi dent of Lake Macquarie Shire Council and all Aldermen and Councillors are called on to oppose any rate increases. A resolution proposed by the Miscellaneous Workers Union said: "Any increase following so soon on last year's increases, when property valuations were increased, would be an unjust imposition on the people." The THC said living standards have been reduced by record price increases, while wages have been virtually pegged by the Arbitration Commission. A delegate told the meeting that the Australian Labor Party's Newcastle Branch has decided to oppose the proposed in creases.
