 STRESS IS ON PRESS SALES CYDNEY: The Communist Party's central com mittee last weekend decided to give main attention to press sales, in the course of its all-round party building work in 1966. It supported the proposal to seek a 10 per cent increase this year in sales of Tribune, Melbourne Guardian and Queensland Guardian. To assist control of the cam paign, sellers and depot con- trollers are being asked to make a special check of paid-up sales and of "returns" for each week in the month of March, and to report these figures to Tribune management. CONTEST Newcastle and Brisbane Dis tricts of the Communist Party have announced that their 1965 party building competition prov ided a valuable exchange of ideas and useful experiences. There were reciprocal visits between the districts and sev eral branches entered into reg ular correspondence. On December 31, Newcastle had taken the honours by 479.9 points, to Brisbane 282.38 points. However while Newcastle gained most points from gain ing 92 new members, no in crease was achieved in Tribune sales. Brisbane's effort was balanced and showed a general forward movement.
