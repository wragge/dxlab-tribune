 Employers counter Unions' claims JYDNEY: Six shillings increase for tradesmen and less for non-tradesmen's grades is the employers' answer to the Unions' wage claims. These increases are put forward in employers' claims to the Arbitration Commission. These claims will be heard at the same time as the Un ions' claims. The employers have repeated their "total wage" proposals which they put forward in 1964 and 1965. In 1965 they proposed an in crease of 1% which meant 4/- for the tradesmen. This year they have increased it to 14% which means 6/- for tradesmen. The total wage proposal seeks to abolish the separate rates of basic wage and margins and to have these joined and expressed in awards as a total wage or alternatively to have both rates reviewed at the same time. In detail their current claims seek: I Abolition of the separately prescribed basic wage and mar gins. © Replacement of these two separate rates by a rate equal ling their total, i.e. ' a "total wage"! Conditional upon this being done an increase of this total wage by .14% for each classifica tion. Or alternatively: An increase in the basic wage of 3/-. An increase of 1% in each margin. © An increase of 4% of the total of the basic wage plus each margin. Each of these proposals works out at 6/- increase for a trades man. The difference between the in creases sought in the unions' and employers' claims is shown in the table using the 6 Capital Cities Basic Wage rate: The employers' claim is strengthened by the majority decision of the Commission in June last year. In that decision three of the five Judges who heard the case (Gallagher, Sweeney and Nim- mo) rejected the Unions' claim for a . 12/- adjustment of the basic wage to meet price in creases which had occurred since the previous June and granted the second part of the employers' claim. They increased the total of the basic wage plus margins by 14% and added this amount to the margin (this meant rais ing the tradesmen from 106/- to 112/-), decided to continue the two rates separately but decid ed also to review the two rates at the same time annually. In these circumstances the ACTU call for a vigorous cam paign in support of the Unions' claims has added importance.
