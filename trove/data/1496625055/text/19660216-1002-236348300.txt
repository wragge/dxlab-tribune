 CAMPAIGNS CAN WIN WAGE, PENSION RISES Wharf ies picnic , SYDNEY: Only a great mass campaign of the Australian working people would be able to break through the rising resistance of employers, courts and government to demands for wage and pension increases and for price control, Mr. L. Aarons, general secretary of the Communist Party of Aus tralia, said last weekend. He told the party's central committee that, despite different views about the basis of arguing in court the case for wage increases, the main thing for trade unionists and their families now was the problem of their - living wage. "The demand being put forward by . the Australian Council of Trade Unions, now over $10 (Â£5), is worthwile and will win wide support, the more so as there will be a flurry of price rackets during the decimal conversion period," he said. FRANK BOSTICK and PAT McKAlG had to have a run-off in the final of the Jim Healy Memorial Race at the Waterside Workers' picnic at Bronte (Sydney) Wednesday last \veek.
