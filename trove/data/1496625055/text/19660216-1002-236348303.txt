 Australian short stories rpHE REALIST (No. 21) is a magazine well worth buying at 3/- a copy. In the story "The Mulgoa Monster," Bernard Peach writes with feeling about workers on a dam, and the District Inspector, who will not give them a go. The workers, with real Australian humor, take the necessary action to stop his stand-over tactics. There is a touching and surprising finale to "Peter Cassidy," by Julian Stuart, which proved for me one of the best stories. "The Wet Trip" by Jack Penberthy was commended by the judges of the Mary Gijmore short story award. It deals with an, outback train crew. Ron Tullipan's "First Frost," about young farm workers, shows they are able to keep their sense of humor even during hard times. A. W. Sheppard, in "The Writer and Censorship," gives Eour points for the writer "who wishes to evade his ' responsibility to be truthful" and five points in "The rules for getting into trouble. . . ." But he deals with a writer's approach to censorship in a positive way. Other articles of note in clude "Our Australian Rabe lais â€” Norman Lindsay" by Ray Williams, "The Trial of Lady Chatterley" by W. A. Wood and "One Man's Truth" by Roger Milliss. THE REALIST is available at New World Booksellers, 425 Pitt Street, Sydney, and other progressive bookshops. J.M.
