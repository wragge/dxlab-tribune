 Good progress against NATO nuclear force (By the Foreign Editor) A STATEMENT last week that the NATO mixed-manned nuclear force project has now been abandoned by the West will give new hopes for a treaty to ban the further proliferation of nuclear weapons. However the drive of the West German militarists to get their hands onto nuclear weapons will not be lightly abandoned. The chief Soviet negotia tor at Geneva, Mr. Tsarap- kin, and. the German Demo cratic Republic foreign min ister, Mr. Georg Stibi, both stated in Geneva last week that the NATO force plan had been dropped. This was apparently con firmed by the British Labor Government's chief Geneva negotiator, Lord Chalfont, that as far as he was concerned the mixed-manned forCe idea was dead. US aims But there was no confirma tion from the US delegate whose Government has- not wavered in its efforts to get nuclear bombs in some way or another into West German hands without openly default ing on its pledges to Ger many's victim-nations of the last war that this would never happen. One way proposed by the JS was the formation of a Multilateral Nuclear Force to which West Germany would contribute personnel. The British Labor Government varied this with a scheme for an Atlantic Nuclear Force bas ed on the same principle. Both projects were deter minedly opposed by the USSR with the full backing of the other socialist nations and all other peace-loving forces. Mr. Tsarapkin said that abandonment of both propos als meant progress towards a non-proliferation treaty. E. German offer After this the USSR brought before the Geneva conference a GDR offer to forgo acquisi tion of nuclear weapons if the West Germans would do the same. This could lead to the set ting up of a nuclear-free zone in central Europe as frequent ly advocated by Poland.
