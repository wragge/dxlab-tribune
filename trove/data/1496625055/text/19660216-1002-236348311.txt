 i Dawson by-election | Neglect puts j Holt Govt. I o" Ae spot I By ou Federal Parliamentary Roundsman. S I j j Dr. Rex Patterson, Labor candidate for the | I Dawson Federal by-election opened his campaign j j at Mackay on February 7, by addressing an | audience of 500, one of the biggest political meet- I 1 ings for years in North Queensland. I Is His address was also broad- 1 cast right throughout the Dawson electorate. TyrR McEWEN, leader of I the Country Party, cam- Ipaigning for his party's can didate, John Fordyce, has been dismayed at the con- I sistent heckling he is re- I ceiving as against the warm | reception electors are giving J Dr. Patterson. I An unexpected windfall for I Dr. Patterson is the fact that S the by-election is being held I during the beginnings of the I decimal currency conversion, | which is adding to the rising prices spiral and must go | against the Government can- | didate. ! Challenged j Dr. Patterson at Mackay ! challenged the Federal Gov- I ernment to point to one de- I velopment project it had ! ever initiated in Dawson. I He accused the Govern- ment of an almost unquali- j fied sell-out to foreign in- j terests of Queensland's most j valuable land and mineral | resources. f The Federal Government, 1 he said, had refused to push ? development of Australia's j richest under-developed wat- j er and soil resources in the Burnett, Fitzroy, Pioneer and ! Burdekin basins. j He called for the develop- j ment of a sugar industry j stabilisation scheme. He also advocated provi- J sion of a northern develop- I ment fund to provide long- j term finance for established : and new producers; a tax- ! free development period for pioneer industries; a devel opment program concen trated around water re sources; development of beef roads in the Mackay hinterland, and a minimum annual northern development budget based on a percent age of consolidated revenue.
