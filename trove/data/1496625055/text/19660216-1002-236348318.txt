 Another Askin scandal ! SCHOOL-BUILDING CONTRACTS HANDED TO PRIVATE CONTRACTORS — AT NEARLY DOUBLE DEPARTMENTAL TENDERS! JYDNEY : Gross wastage of public money badly needed to solve the education crisis has become a reality under the Askin Government's school building contract system. A New South Wales organiser of the Building Workers Industrial Union (Mr. R. Monaghan) last week accused the Askin Liberal Government of giving out public school building contracts to pri vate companies at ex orbitant prices. Mr. Monaghan made this accusation following a tour of primary school projects being carried out in the outer western area of Sydney. Prior to the liberal Govern- ment taking office in NSW, the building of primary schools was traditionally done by the Public Works' Depart ment. iSince the change of Gov ernment, tenders have been called for this work. ML Monaghan said he was informed that the PWD had tendered a price of $38,000 (£19, 000) to build a small school as againsfc a contractor's price of $S4,0G& (£32,000). He sjaid the public should be told whether or not it is a fact that some tenders were so exorbitant that the Dep- artment had to take back 14 contracts. A public inquiry should look into, this matter in light of the Government's program of "economies" in education, in cluding school buildings The Building unions last December condemned the Gov ernment over sackings of building workers from the School Section of the PWD. The .NSW Teachers' Feder ation also is vigorously oppos ing the cuts in planned ex penditure on education. Miscellaneous Workers Union members are up in arms against the plan to employ contract cleaners in schools. Are these economies necess ary to enable lucrative con tracts to be handed out to private enterprise? [?]
