 LET'S AIR OUR VIEWS p VERYONE will agree that television is really part of our lives, but that does not mean we always like aD the programmes that are screened. So let's have a forum by letter and invite the other Junior Tribune readers up to 16 years to join us. The question is "Do you think that the programmes for children are good enough and if not what would you like to see?" A good friend of Tribune Juniors has given us two lovely diaries for prizes for the Junior and Senior Section, and also one for the up to 16 years. Send your entries in up to noon on the 3rd March, and the best letters will be pub lished.
