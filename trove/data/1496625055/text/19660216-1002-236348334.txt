 [?] A better deal for the potato farmer VA/ITH the present price of potatoes ranging from 6d to 1/- per lb., the housewife naturally thinks that the grower is making a small fortune, but when the following costs are taken into con sideration it will show clearly the need for some form of organisation to give the farmer a reason able return for- his labour. The following expensive machinery is necessary for the grower; tractor ploughs, cultivator, rotary hoe attach ments, potato planter digger, spray for dealing with insects, pests and seed cutters. To have reasonable chance of a successful crop, an irrigation plant is most essential, and this would range from £1,000 to £3, 600. The price of seed, from which the present crop is be ing harvested, cost $120 per ton (15 bags). 1 ton of seed will sow about 2i acres. When the crop is ready to harvest, (the average being about 5 tons to thfe acre) the farmer buys potato bags at 20c each, if they are sold with in the State. If the potatoes are sold interstate, then they must be placed in new bags at 40c each. Labourers hired "to pick up and bag the potatoes after the 1 machine has dug them up, are paid 30c per bag. The price of potatoes is gov erned by the question of sup ply and demand; if there is a good season and the crop is heavy then the grower is at the mercy of the agent. Last year when the season was a good one, with big crops in the Maitland District, potatoes sold at '$20 per ton. During the recent Xmas season the price was $40 per ton. Potato farmers should or ganise a board to include rep resentatives of the consuming public as members to give the farmer and the public a bet ter deal. Potato Farmer, Maitland (NSW)
