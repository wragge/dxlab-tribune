 Another j rise for ! Adelaide dailies ! Jp ELAIDE: The new 5c price for the "News" and "Advertiser" means the price will be in- creased from 5d to 6d. It will bring mere than i\ million, or million, in crease in yearly revenue for the "Advertiser" and about £175,000, or 8350,000, for the "News. Both papers increased their price' in 1964 by Id. This means that since that year the total increase in yearly revenue has been about £850,C(00. This is a lot of money, even making allowance for payments t-i agents which, at the 1.964 rise, wati reported to be one quarter. The latest increase, made under the guise of decimal currency, will benefit at least 12 of Adelaides' monopoly families who have interests in the daily press. They include such well known ones as Rymill, Bony- thon, Angus, Barr Smith, Downer, Kidman and' McBride. Sir Arthur Rymill (Adver tiser) is a Liberal Party member of the Upper House of "privilege" and 1 a great- talker about protecting the public interest; Advertising rates have risen; newspapers rely upon adver tising to make their profit. The "Advertiser" recently boasted it carried more col- umn-i of advertising than any other newspaper in Australia. The owners argue the case of increased costs which would include wages. There is no evidence 'to show) thjat |t(he wages of newspaper workers has gone up to any substan tial degree. Consolidated net profit for the "Advertiser" for the year ended December 31, 1964, (the latest figures available) was £809,304. According to the Chairman, Sir Lloyd Dumas, this was a year of "record profit". In that year £400,000 was put aside for income tax (£50,000 more than the pre vious year) and £300,000 for depreciation (up £75,000) . Actual ordinary dividend payment was £474,000 as against the previous year of £339,000.
