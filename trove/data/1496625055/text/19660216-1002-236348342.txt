 EQUAL PAY IN I W.A. REJECTED j BY GOVT. I PERTH: The Western Australian State Government has rejected in full the principle of equal pay, in a welter of specious arguments, buckpassing and threats against general wage standards. It has refused to make legislative provision on equal pay for equal work, as N.S.W. did in 1958. It has washed its hands of responsibility towards Public service employees. The equal pay campaign has for many years been a football tossed between the Arbitration Court and Parliament; with the organisations and workers con cerned leaning over backwards to try and meet every shift in position and argument. The W.A. Trades and Labour Council Secretary (Mr. J. W. Coleman) said the decision was a grave disservice to women, particularly when industry is calling on their services more. The Government he said, is only interested in enticing big monopoly industries into this State. It has no loyalty to the people engaged in these indus tries. "What would be done now", he continued "is a matter for Council to decide, but my feel ing is that the Unions have been forced into a position where they may have to take other forms of action they have been reluctant to adopt." The Cabinet decision was made after considering a re port on equal pay by Labour Minister O'Neil after the main test case tor equal pay was taken before Commissioner Kelly and then by Appeal to the full Industrial Court, by the Miscellaneous Workers' Union supported by the T.L.C. The Union sought an amend ment to the dairy factory indus try award, covering Sunny West Dairies and others. The deci sion would have immediately affected 60 women now doing work previously done by men. It would have meant an important breakthrough in other industries.
