 Pravda hits at Indo frame up kiOSCOW: The military trial in Djakarta, Indonesia, of alleged par- ticinants ini the "Seotem- ber 30 movement" is being conducted in conditions of massive political terror and anti - communist hysteria, says Pravda in Moscow. "Official Indonesian reports admit that only a narrow group of people took part in the 'September 30 movement'. Hence the broad mass of the Communists and members of other democratic political or ganisations had nothing to do with it." The paper says that Right- wing groups exploited the at tempted coup to launch a fierce, countrywide campaign against ther Communist Party and other progressive organisations. "The Communist Party was accused of ah attempted coup d'etat. The legal CP of Indonesia was virtually banned. "Mass organisations, trades unions, farmers, youths' and women's organisations were outlawed. Many party leaders were killed." \ j Pravda notes that according to President Sukarno 87,000 people were killed without trial or investigation in the three months after October 1, in cen tral and eastern Java, Bali and north Sumatra alone. "About 200,000 have been im prisoned and hundreds of thousands deprived of the right to work." Pravda says that savage ter ror against innocent people demands condemnation. "All who cherish the ideals of national independence, democracy and independence, will closely watch the proceed ings of this unusual court", Pravda adds. In a speech at a mass meet ing in Jakarta last week Presi dent Sukarno stressed the need for unity of the Indonesian peo ple for the attainment of the aims of the revolution. The president said that In donesia's independence was achieved through the struggle of nationalists, religious 'groups and communists. Therefore ! indepi eindence should not be regarded as the exclusive achievement of any one group. The Communists, he emphasis ed, had made a big contribu tion to the attainment of in dependence. .
