 French tests protest by the ICFTU "|"HE International Confederation of Free Trade Unions has endorsed the decisions of a trade union conference held last De cember in Sydney in opposition to French nuclear tests in the Pacific. 4 The conference was called by the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the New Zealand Federation of Labor and included delegates from Singapore, New Caledonia and Malaysia. , ; Mr. A. Monk (ACTU pres ident) said last week in Mel bourne that the ICFTU's ex ecutive board had adopted the conference declaration in Brussels this month. The declaration called on all nations which had not already done so to sign immediately the test ban treaty, the provisions of which should be extended to cover all testing, including underground. Mr. Monk said he had sub mitted the declaration on his recent trip to Europe. He said it had become policy for the trade-union movement throughout the world. The Sydney conference also said that if France, or any other nation in the Pacific, continued to ignore world opinion and persisted with the preparation for testing of nuclear devices, the trade-union movements in the Pacific area would be re commended to consider sanc tions. They would also be recom mended to consider taking ap propriate steps to prevent such tests, including the refusal to handle any goods, equipment or material used in the erection of the nuclear testing site. He said the A.C.T.U. would have to watch the situation in the Pacific, particularly any French vessel touching the shores of Australia and New Zealand and likely to be carry ing men or supplies for the French testing base.
