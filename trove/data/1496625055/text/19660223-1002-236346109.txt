 SA Unions for ALP executive A DELAIDEâ€” The Australian Railways Union, the State committee of the Boilermakers' Society, the Federated Engine- drivers and Firemen's Associa- tion ana tne Transport w onc ers' Union have declared them selves in opposition to the moves to change the leadership of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party. Other Unions have also dis cussed the matter and it is believed that they also support retaining the present leadership of Mr. Calwell and are critical of the bid by Mr. Whitlam. A number of tlie unions have expressed the view that the move by Mr. Whitlam has split the Labor Party and will do untold damage to the Labor Party's prospects at the Feder al elections later this year. They say that there is ample opportunity for ALP members to change the policies of their Party by working within the existing organisation and that no member has the right to go to the press in order to organ ise its support behind him.
