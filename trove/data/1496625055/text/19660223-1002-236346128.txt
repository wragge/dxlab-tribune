 : J Bigger fish in Palmer Scandal? CUMMONSES taken out against three prin cipals of H. G. Palmer appear little more than a smokescreen ror bigger fish involved in the MLC- H. G. Palmer scandal. Palmer's founder and managing director, Her bert George Palmer; the former secretary, William Howard Rose; and aud itor John McBlane have been charged with issuing a false prospectus in Jan uary, 1965. The maximum sentence for this offence is 10 years' jail. However, the invest igation ordered by the N.S.W. Liberal Govern ment appears to have ignored evidence on actions by MLC directors, ap parently more serious than anything alleged against the men charged. Used name These men used the then respected name of MLC Ltd. to entice Australians to in vest millions in H. G. Palmer. They did this when they must have known the over- large electrical group was in grave financial difficulties. Yet they continued to print "a subsidiary of MLp. Ltd!." on H. G. Palmer prospectuses calling for public money. Much of the money must have been used in a last- ditch attempt to protect the interests of the wealthy NSW families controlling MLC. As a result, debenture holders alone stand to lose more than 40 million dollars â€” and this money must have been in peril when MLC directors were drawing off fat dividends from what were new obviously fictitious profits. Question If MLC directors didn't know the state of the com pany's accounts when the alleged false prespectus was issuedl in January last year, then they are guilty of negligence as directors. NSW Labor Member MEr. Mallam has asked' the NSW Attorney-General, Mr. McCaw, to investigate the rather peculiar financial moves surrounding the MX.C take over of H. G. Palmer in 1963.
