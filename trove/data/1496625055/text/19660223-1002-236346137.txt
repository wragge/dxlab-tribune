 LANDMARK FOR PEACE I The peace sign that has become a landmark. Painted on the approach to a hill on the Tamworth-Manilla road (northern NSW) /j covers almost the full width of the road and is several feet high. Thousands of vehicles haVe passed over it since it I appeared, but it remains unblemished. If you happen to lose your way in the district and ask one of the locals for directions, I the answer will more than likely go something like this: "Take the turn-off about three miles past the big. peace sign."
