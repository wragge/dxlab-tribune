 Grabbing NG ores, too pON-ZINC-RIO TINTO Co. the big British-dominat ed metals combine, are lin ing up the Australian Gov- ernment to assist them in grabbing the copper deposits on Bougainville Island. Australian Territories Min ister Barnes comes forward with the preposterous theory that the people only own the land and not the mineral con tent. He claims this is the British system. (Possibly this theory is behind the give-away of oil leases for foreign companies in Australia.) The fact is that the land AND its mineral content be longs to the people who are the inhabitants, in this case the Bougainville people, and it is important that they stand firm on their demand that the royalties be paid to them. This is recognised on Nauru and Ocean Island; true there are disputes in these places but only on the amount of royalty. The Bougainvillians should not be intimidated by the Company threats to give up the deposits. The deposits list ed as low grade, are in fact high grade, which the world wide monopoly does not in tend to share with the nation al owners, unless they have no choice. . New Guineans also will be faced with many similar pro positions in the future. If they fail to stand firm, this great wealth will be grabbed by for eign monopolies whilst the New Guineans will be no bet ter off. It is most important, too, that New Guinea insist on the registration of the companies exploiting their mineral wealth. Jim Cooper, Sydney.
