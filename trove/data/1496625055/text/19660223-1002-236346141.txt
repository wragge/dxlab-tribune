 [?] Try telling the Japanese about our ship policy As an Australian citizen, 1 was recently at a loss to explain to interest ed people at Kobe, Japan, why Australia — which has just signed some of the largest iron ore trade agreements ever known — has no overseas ships carrying this vast mineral wealth. I was there as a crew mem ber of the Iron Clipper, on the BHP's company first venture into overseas trade with a cargo of Australian coal to Japan. I was also at a loss to ex plain why this ship, although manned by Australian seamen, was registered in London and flying the English red ensign. (As an unofficial ambassador of my country, I would be proud to sail under the Aus tralian flag overseas and show it in all ports of the world.) I have written asking the Minister for Shipping, Mr. Freeth, to write to the news paper Japan Times to explain why this is so. As a seaman and citizen, I think the time has come for an overseas shipping line, preferably government-owned. In the past, the Government has claimed that the "high wages of Australian seamen" (a myth) made overseas ship ping a poor investment. BHP has to this date sent two ships with loads of Aus tralian coal to Japan and con templates further deliveries with Australian-owned and manned ships. Do they do this other than for profit and capital gain? They must be quite happy to pay our alleged high wages and still show a profit margin. E. J. SMITH, M.V. Iron Clipper, Port Kembla, (NSW)
