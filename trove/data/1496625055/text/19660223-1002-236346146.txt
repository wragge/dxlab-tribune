 [?] ore ban? PERTH : Hamersley Iron Pty. Ltd. is still trying to break the deadlock on the Federal Government's refusal to allow the export of iron ore pellets at a price considered detrimental to Australia. While the ban is not likely to produce the dire consequences predicted by the State Government and interested parties, and is in fact welcomed by those who are concerned about Australia's national interests, there are many strange features about the Federal Government's action. It was not until the Federal elections neared that the Government decided to take a stand. It had previously approved the Tasmanian Savage River sell-out at a lower price than that questioned in the Hamersley case. The Labor Party all along has been expressing dis agreement on. the way the Liberal Governments have been handing Australia's raw materials to -overseas companies. There are also signs that the Country Party has had conscience worries about the doings of its Liberal Party partner. That the bulk of the, iron deposits are owned by overseas companies has been well publicised. (Ham ersley Iron is a consortium of British and American giants â€” Conzino;Rio Tinto and Kaiser Steel) . However, the history of their dealings and the prices for which they have been selling the ore have not. The price on the banned contract was 18 (US) cents per 1 per cent Fe, whereas the first contract (which was approved) was 18.5 cents per 1 p.c. Fe. The subsequent dealings show how the price for similar high grade ore was lowered without any interest bzing shown by the, Liberal-CP Government, which approved the export licences for the following: Hamersley Iron 65.6 million tons of lump ore (64 pc iron), 15.5c per 1 pc Fe; Mt. Goldsworthy Mining Asso ciates, 16.5 million tons of lump ore, 15.4c per 1 pc Fe; Mt. Newman Iron Ore Co. Ltd., 100 million tons of lump ore, 14.64c per 1 pc Fe.
