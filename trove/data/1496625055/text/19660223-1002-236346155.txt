One of the roost substan tial donations sent in to express congratulations for our new paper is from A. J. J. Tewantin who sent $13,30. Butch Wharton of New castle writes: "Do you believe that C. Day change-over went very smoothly? I sold 8 Tribs. on Saturday morn ing. five of them to women atftfcr they read the poster about the new currency!" Avd with this note Butch , sent $3 donations. A lad who sends his don ations in under the ncm-de- plume of Greenacre Seller sells six papers each week. For each one he receives 20c. making a donation of 12c on each paper.
