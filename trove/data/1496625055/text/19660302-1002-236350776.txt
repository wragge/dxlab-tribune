 TRIBUNE AS AN 'ANTIDOTE' By June Mills "Keep on urging for those dollars so that we can get the antidote to the distortions coming from the radio, TV and daily press ..." runs a letter this week i from my old friend J. K. of Belmore. "The fight to bring about those conditions conducive to building health, strength and happiness in the people of the world is the grandest of all , fights," he says. J With the letter J. K. sent a | donation of $2. He has been j a battler for the workers for ! many years and his good I wishes and donation are much j appreciated. j It was a. lucky break for ! Tribune that M. Tabula of I Bowen, Queensland received a j $2 bill first in the new currency, i M. Tabula wrote "I decided to give my first dollar bill to j Tribune, but the first one was i two dollars so I am sending I that. The next one will go to I Queensland Guardian and I | hope that is two dollars also". j Will all contributors please : note that owing to the new ! schedule for Tribune, in future I only donations received, up to Friday will be acknowledged in the following issue. Previ ously the Fund was kept open until the Monday for receipt of donations. Donations this week came from as far away as Collie (West Australia), Bowen (QLD) and New Lambton, NSW.
