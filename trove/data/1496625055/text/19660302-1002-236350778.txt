 Once there were eight now there are none! Seamen demand j trans-Tasman service i i JYDNEY: Australian sea- | men at their stopwork 1 meeting last week in Syd- ney called for immediate j government action to re store a regular passenger \ service between Australia and New Zealand. '? Seamen's Union Federal - &lt; Secretary told the meeting ! there were once eight pas- j senger ships on the trans- 4 Tasman run, now there were ; none. I \ "It is an indictment of the | ' Australian and New Zealand J Governments that they allowed I S these ships to go out of com mission without the Govern ments themselves continuing the services," he said. The urgency of the seamen's I demand was given added | weight by a press report last 1 week that none of the lifeboats 4 on the Japanese ship "Orient ' &lt; Queen" could have been used i in an emergency. This ship, previously the Australian-owned "Kanimbla," has been on the trans-Tasman I run as part of its Pacific cruises. The seamen point out that the Japanese captain was fined ; $500 plus $12 costs by a special " I court for breaching the Navir i gation Act. | ' Court proceedings followed - i an inspection of the ship by a hi marine surveyor in Sydney on fp November 17. r i This was the day after it , arrived with passengers from f f New Zealand. I j The seamen's unions of both countries have urged the re- ' sumption of the passenger s service and claim the service was deliberately stopped by t the international monopoly . !| shipping lines. Mr. Elliott has called for a |f new service involving at least . two Government-owned roll-on „tr-f roll-off ferries. ' This demand by Mr. Elliott t % received wide publicity by the VjS New Zealand press during his j j J recent two weeks' visit to that country. 1 3? He said both Governments if, accepted the responsibility of . running internal and overseas f airlines, but refuse to enter shipping in the same way. IS "Substantial losses were re- mm suiting from this state of ;/,||| affairs. "Last year the Conference ; Lines - had taken $860 million ||| from the Australian import- % export and passenger trade and | had ploughed back only $160 | million by way of port fees, , | fuel purchases and seamen's \ wages," he said. 1 It is now reported that on the initiative of the New Zea- land Government preliminary talks have been held between 1 \ both Governments on the pos- J sibility of a passenger roll-on roll-off ferry service across the Tasman. &lt;« "c A job meeting last week, at gg| number 7 Pyrmont, Sydney, j|| addressed by Tom Nelson, sec- IS retary of the Sydney branch | of the WWF.
