 NEW THEATRE A bright new song about Sydney's local constabulary has been added to New Theatre's topical review, "You've Never Had It So Good." Only two more weekends to see this smash show, which closes on Saturday, March 1Z. YEVTUSHENKO should be a great success at the Adelaide Festival of Arts, which begins on March 1 0. He is a fine poet. His poetry recitals have packed large halls in almost every capital city in Europe and at art festivals in Italy and Germany. It is understood that he will recite some Australian poems as well as the work of several Sov iet poets apart from his own. A volume of new Yevtushenko poems translated into English is being published by Sun Books to coincide with his arrival. The Adelaide Festival of Arts Committee has shown great acu men in inviting Yevtushenko to participate in the Festival: it is a step in the direction of putting the Festival firmly on the world map. "TIME' AND PATRICK WHITE The American magazine "Time" has attacked Patrick White's new novel "The Solid Mandala" with a venom it generally reserves for Communists, peace workers and progressives of all shades. What did Patrick White write that aroused "Time" to such a fury? Although I haven't, seen the new novel it has yet to appear in England and Australia. I am pre pared to assume that Patrick White has said something which runs counter to "Time's" 'world out look'. This can be summed up as fascist- loving and warmongering; it is the voice of those aggressive American monopolists who believe the whole world is their pigeon and must be devoured.
