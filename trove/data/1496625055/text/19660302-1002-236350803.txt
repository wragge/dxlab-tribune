 Another park grab on way Jâ€” |OME Unit developers' greedy hands are stretch ing out for another choice part of the Sydney harbour. Planned for a park by the North Sydney Council, it consists of two and a half choice acres behind Kurraba Point. It is the site of the old ferry maintenance shop of the Port Jackson and Manly Steamship Company. The North Sydney Council zoned the area for a recreation space following zoning by the Cumberland Council for light in dustry. A letter from the State Plan ning Authority to the Council makes clear that the authority is not prepared to acquire the land from its own funds. It says: "The council is urged to determine the future of the land as quickly as possible as the company might otherwise be forced to reopen the depot as a commercial background." The land would bring a great amount of money if allowed to be used for high density housing.
