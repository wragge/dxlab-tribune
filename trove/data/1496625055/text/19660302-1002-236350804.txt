 B with NOEL COUNIHAN j The two Soiiet writers | The recent public state- | ment by the general secre- | tary of the Communist Partv of Australia, Laurie I Aarons, criticising the I conditions of the closed i trial and harsh sentencing of two until now obscure writers in the Soviet ! Union has the full support I of this column, which I stands for artistic and literary freedom. I The persistence of a censor ship mentality in official Soviet circles is of deep concern to all friends of the Soviet Union and to many, especially in worlds of art and literature, who have responded warmly to the great liberalisation of Soviet cultural life since the Stalin era. Such trials belittle the vast j strength and unity of the USSR. (They undermine confidence in Soviet democracy when anti- | democratic practices in the im- | perialist countries are more I than ever under fire from pro- ! gressive people. i Moreover, the ultimate vic tims of these trials are on the one hand Soviet art itself and f on the other the democratic I principles of the world com- munist movement.
