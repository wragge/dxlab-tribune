They are now actu ally establishing "Overseas Cam puses" or wholly self-contained academic communities operating as colonies of the home univer sities. The Stanford University prog ramme at Tours, Florence and Stuttgart (with two additional ones scheduled to open near Nottingham and Vienna) are typ ical examples. In addition 66 American Univer sities operate technical aid mis sions in 39 countries, almost a half of which are in the Near and Middle East. Then there are the special academic positions in Europe that have been created for Americans. These include in addition to the Fulbright professorships, endow- ned chairs at Oxford, the Univer sity of Madrid, and. other univer sities. There are even American pro cessors whb are regular comm uters between their home univer sities and European universities.
