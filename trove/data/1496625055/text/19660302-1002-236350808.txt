 Greedy Landlords A MATE of mine signed a 17A agreement with his landlord in June, 1965, allow ing for an increase in his rental from 33/- to £3/3/- for a period of two years. This is approximately a 90 per cent, increase, and this chap is no £3,000-a-year in come earner. As a builders' laborer he would be flat out to get into the £1,000 bracket. The other day he received a letter and a new contract to be signed seeking a fur ther increase of £1 per week, making it £4/3/- altogether. The letter explained that the extra £1 was needed to meet the big increase in values, which affected the outgoings of cash. The letter also explained that the agree- . ment could be arrived at without the expense, tension or time of a Fair Rent Court attendance. (Very considerate, I must say.) It will be interesting to find how the Landlord and Tenant Act stands on this matter, for it would appear here that the landlords want rentals over a definite period, and secondly they want the benefits of the Act as it pertains to the protected tenant; that is, when an in crease occurs in rates and charges, they can pass it on to the tenant. When this clause, 17 A, was before Parliament and in public statements made by Mr. Maddison, Minister for Justice, nothing was said of this dual procedure. We can rest assured that this will not be an isolated case, as the landlord in this instance has a great number of rented properties in and around Sydney. No doubt Mr. , Maddison will be called upon to give an answer to this question. Jim Sharrock, Redfem (NSW).
