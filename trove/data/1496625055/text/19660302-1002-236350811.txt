 Case for the half-cent UERE is a conversion table which I have compiled showing the exact relation between the old and new currencies: 1 penny = 5-6 cent 3 pennies = 13-3 cenfs 3 pennies = 2i cents 4 pennies = 3 1-3 cents 5 pennies = 4 1-6 cents 6 pennies = 5 cents -7 pennies = 5 5-6 cents 8 pennies = 62-3 cents 9 pennies = 71 cents 10 pennies = 8 1-3 cents 11 pennies = 91-6 cents 12 pennies = 10 cents It will be seen from the above table that 3 pence and 9 pence are exactly equal to 2h cents and 74 cents re spectively. This shows that had provision been made for a i cent coin the recent rob bery of the public in the form of the increase of the 9d bus fare to 1/-,. for ex ample, could have been avoided. As this increase in fares will mean an increase of ap proximately $500,000 per year for the Transport Depart- it is suggested that the pub lic could be compensated for this robbery in the form of an improved peak hour ser vice (particularly along Ox ford Street, City) or an in crease in wages for trans- port workers. â€” N.N., Fairfield, NSW.
