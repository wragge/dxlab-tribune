 i The Judges record j $ Each of the three Judges | who will hear the current | claims has been associated ! with previous basic wage I claims. « JUDGE WRIGHT, who S will preside over the cur- I rent cases, was a member 1 of the Benches which dealt with the basic wage claims I ing 1956, 1957 and 1958. | In 1956 the unions claimed | an increase of 38/-. The ! Judges awarded 10/-. In j 1957 a 23/- claim brought | a 10/- rise and in 1958 a ! 21/- claim brought a 5/- ( rise. In this latter case | Judge Wright said he fa.v- I ored more than a 5/- in- | crease, but did not say how | much. | JUDGE GALLAGHER I was involved in the 1958, 1959 and 1964 basic wage i cases. He was a party to the 5/- increase in answer L to the unions' 21/- claim in 1958. In 1959 a 22/ claim brought a 15/- rise and in 1964 a. 52/- claim brought £1 increase, but Judge Gal lagher was in the minority in awarding only 10/-. In 1965 he was one of the majority of three Judges . who rejected the unions' claims and granted, in part, the employers' claims. JUDGE MOORE dealt with basic wage claims in I960, 1961 and 1964. In 1960 the unions' claim for 22/- increase was complete ly rejected and no increase was granted. In 1961 a 52/- claim brought a 12/- increase, and in 1964 Judge Moore joined Judge Kirby in awarding 20/- increase on the unions' 52/-. claim. He also joined Judge Kirby in a minority Judg ment in 1965 which rejected the employers' claims and j favored giving an 8/- basic j wage rise in answer to the S unions' claim for 12/-. I Judge Moore was also a j member of the Bench which ! dealt with margins claims in I 1959 when a 28 per cent j increase was granted, and j in 1963 when the increase I was 10 per cent. j In both cases the unions' | claim for restoration of the ! 1947 margins standards was | rejected. j CONCILIATION COM- S MISSIONER WINTER was j !a mem,ber of the Bench | which rejected the employ- 1 ers' "total wage" claim in I 1964. S All this reinforces the1 g importance of the campaign I called for by leading un- j ion bodies in support of the | reasonable claims now. 1 made. | .
