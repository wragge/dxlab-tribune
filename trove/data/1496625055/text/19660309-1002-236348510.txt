 Govt, meddles with long service leave SYDNEY: The NSW Labor Council last week called on unions to protest against a bill introduced I by the State Liberal Government to amend the NSW Long Service Leave Act. The Building Workers' In dustrial Union had earlier warned Council that the Gov ernment's intention is to re introduce the obnoxious "dis missal for serious miscon duct" provision. This provision enabled em ployers to impose a double pen alty on workers by dismissing them from employment and then refusing to pay them their long service leave entitlements. The BWIU said this first at tempt by the Liberal Govern ment to worsen workers stand ards should be strongly resisted by the trade union movement. Mr. P. Clancy (NSW secretary BWIU) told Council of a case where a carpenter was sacked by Metters in 1959 for receiv ing 70c worth of company petrol without permission. He was fined $20 by the court and the company then refused to pay him $256 owing in long service leave. Labor Council officials will take this matter up with the Industrial Committee of the Australian Labor Party to if necessary have passage of the Bill blocked by the Legislative Council. '
