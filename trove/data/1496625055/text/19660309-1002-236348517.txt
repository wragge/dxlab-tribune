 . . . and Muttniks MOSCOW: "Little Piece of Coal" and "Little Breeze", the highest fliers ever, are sending back biological data from cosmic radiation zones of vital iniportance to more distant space flights by man. The launching of the dogs follows increasingly sophisti cated experiments in Soviet space biology designed to safeguard planetary explorers against radiation. Soviet experts point out that return to earth by dogs preceded Gagarin's flight and it is inferred, that this first flight of dogs since the pre- Gagarin tests is a prelude to bigger things in space, parti cularly in view of Luna 9's soft landing.
