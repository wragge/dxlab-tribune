 S Riding a tricycle j on the sea floor j DELAIDE: A Soviet scientist rode a tricycle along the sea- j ! bed two miles out from the suburban beach of Glenelg. j He was Yuri Kurochin, Professor of Biology and Pedology at the Institute of Biology, Vladivostok University. The 35-year-old professor was in Adelaide with the 3.400 tons fisheries research ship "Akademikberg." He was diving with the SA Museum Underwater j Research Group and is be- j lieved to be the first Soviet j citizen to dive in Australian! waters. j I Reason for his unexpected $ | role as ' champion under- I I water cyclist was that he | ! found a tricycle near a ! | reef. So he hopped on and I | was away. j | On land, social and j I scientific exchanges took | ! place between Soviet and ! | Australian scientists. j 1 SA underwater research I !" worker, Mr. S. Shepherd, j said that the Soviet scien- | tists had a better knowledge j | about fisheries potential j | "at our own doorstep" j j than even local scientists. !
