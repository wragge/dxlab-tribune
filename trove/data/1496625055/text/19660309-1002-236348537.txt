 SA ballot tor ILO delegate yDELAIDE : In an election for the SA Trades and Labor Councils' delegate to this year's ILO Con ference, R. Griffiths ASE defeated R. Glastonbury ETU by 106 votes 35 in a second ballot. The first ballot held u >?i- night earlier was declared null and void by the returning of ficer because of some inad vertent technical irregulari ties concerning the quota ne cessary to elect a candidate and the allocation of prefer ence. In his report to the Trades and Labor Council the return ing officer admitted these mis takes but said that a recount of the first ballot had taken place by someone other than the re turning officer and his scrutin eers before his report could be adopted by the Council and that he took strong exception to this. It had been suggested by the TLC secretary Mr. L. Johns that the ballot should be recounted. When this was done by the re turning officer and one scrutin eer before Mr. Johns and the minute secretary Mr. W. Brown it was discovered that there was an apparent discrepancy in the number of votes for the two candidates concerned compared with the original count and the exhaustive check made at that time. Delegates expressed concern at the facts revealed in the re port and closely questioned the officers of the Council. A pro posal by the executive that the new election should he held in two weeks' time was defeated in favour of an immediate elec tion. Proposals made by the re turning officer for stricter con trol of future elections were adopted. In an election for minute sec retary Mr. D. Marshall, secre tary of the Building Trades Fed eration polled 51 votes against W. Brownâ€” an increase of 50% in the votes against Brown com pared with a year ago.
