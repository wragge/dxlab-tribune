 Tribute to Norman Jefferv " TRUE son of the working ckr-s and a proud Australian was Norman Jeffery, Com munist Party foundation member and former Cen- tral committee member. The tribute was paid by the Party's President, Mr. R. Dixon, at the funeral of Norman Jeffery in Sydney last week. "All his life he was devoted to the labor movement," said Mr. Dixon. ."And he fought passionately and militantly for the great causes of, the labor movement â€”for peace, democratic rights, for progress, for socialism.' A great number of comrades and 'friends of Norman Jeffrey, and trades union and peace movement supporters, attended the funeral at the Northern Suburbs Crematorium. As a trade union executive member from the age of 16, Norman Jerfrey had learned that unity strengthened a union while disunity weakened it and brought defeat. From those early years he was an ardent supporter of unions and the unity of the Working class. "His studies led him to the view that the evils of capital ism could only be overcome by socialism; and this should be the final aim of the labor movement's struggle." In consequence, said . Mr. Dixon, Norman Jeffery became one of the small band of men and women who took the his toric decision to form the Communist Party of Australia.
