 "In quest of health" jOST people in Australia just don't have tinie to be ill. It's too costly, any way, and unless you're really laid low, you're off back to work almost as s"oon as you can stagger to the nearest transport. But there are countries' where the sole aim of the health system is to get sick people well, no matter the time or cost. After years of struggle in the cause of international under standing and peace, Rev. Frank Hartley, Superintendent of the Prahran Methodist Mission, Vic toria, went to the U.S.S.R. for treatment for a serious heart condition. His wife travelled with him, and underwent two operations there. They spent two months in a public hospital and sanat orium. Frank Hartley's obser vations from inside the Soviet health system can be found in his recent booklet "In Quest of Health", illustrated with repro ductions of his own oils of Bar- vikha Sanatorium and the Krem lin Central Clinic Hospital. It is a warm, human tribute to the Soviet doctors, nurses and attendants, to their thoroughness - and loving care (his own words). Against this, difficulties like in explicable long waits become minor matters, at least in retro spect. As weir as giving a simple, personal account of getting well under socialism, he comments on some of the changes in the Soviet Union since his first visit 14 years before. ,He takes you to church services in Moscow, and introduces you to a minor controversy on the therapeutic value of aromas as practised in the "Health Zone" in Baku. "In Quest of Health" is on sale at the New World Bookshop 425 Pitt Street. Svdnev and other progressive bookshops. â€” R.W. Rev. Hartley
