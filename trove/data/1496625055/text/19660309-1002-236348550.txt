 Surfing j Titles at j Wollongong j By RON MACKERRAS MEXT week-end will see S the State Surf titles at I North Wollongong. I This venue will give people i the opportunity to witness ? the type of youth trained by j the Australian surf life sav- | ing movement. ! The heroic acts of the I young lifesavers in the re- S cent Coledale shark victim | rescue could have happened ! on almost any beach of the j Australian coastline — for | such is the standard of the | conduct in the life saving I clubs. i If visiting members "play- | up" a little after the carnival, I I hope older people will not j be too harsh in thedr judge- z merit— some of them (the I members)' could very well j be the press heroes of two j weeks back. j The blue ribbon event, Res- I cue and Resuscitation: Bon- | di, Wanda and Freshwater £ clubs, with most opposition j from the Illawarra repres- j entatives. j I expect Greg Rogers to ! dominate the junior swim- ( ming events with most op- \ position from young Derwin . of Newcastle and the usually I strong contingent from Ilia- - 1 warra clubs. jj Senior Surf race: T. Buck, j G. Rogers. Senior Belt race: j T. Buck, B. Rogers and B. j Moore. Senior Teams race: ! Clovelly, North Cronulla and | Stanwell Park. March Past: I Collaroy, Coogee and Mere- j wether. Senior Boat race: j Swansea, Caves ' beach and | Newport. Junior Boat race: 1 Cronulla, North Cronulla ? and Dee Why. Beach Sprint: I Newman, Chowne and Maid- | en. j Beach events are special- \ ised in by country clubs and | they should dominate all j except the beach sprint and I the beach relay. j PHOTO: More swimming pools like this one at Sans Souci (Sydney) are needed, but with the added facilities for heating in winter.
