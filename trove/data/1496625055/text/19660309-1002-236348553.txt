 Rail workers defend trade union rights PERTH: A large mass meeting of workers at the Midland Railway Workshops on Tuesday, March 1 resolved that a further mass meeting be called to en able suitable direct action to be taken if the manage ment's attacks and disruption of trade union rights continues. Before Christmas the Rail ways Department applied to the Arbitration Commission to amend the award to seri ously curtail union activities in the Workshops. If successful workers and shop stewards could negotiate only to foreman level. From then on, the union officials would take over to tell the man agement. This would bog down the Joint Railway Unions Com mittee in the workshopis and end the right of shop stewards ! to deal with the management. Despite the fact that the case ! is adjourned the management | started implementing their j policy. Since Christmas they ! have refused to meet deputa- j tions; correspondence is being j ignored or delayed answers are | sent to queries. | Decree t In the Fitting Shop the fore- j man placed a decree on the j notice board informing work- ! ers that they must take their j complaints direct to the fore- i man; any worker going direct to his union would be "dealt I with". j A new form has been printed so that workers with queries | for the Staff Officer have to ) obtain foreman approval to go ! to the main office even at lunch | time and after work. I The railway workers are ( determined to smash the at- tacks. They point out that the Midland Workshops has been a traditional spearhead of work ers' campaigns in W.A. Victory for the Department and the Lib eral government they feel would pave the way for further gen eral attacks on the trade union movement in W.A. When the case reopens before the Arbitration Commission many workers are expected to fill the galleries.
