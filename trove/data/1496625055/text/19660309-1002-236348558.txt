 ALP Vietnam meeting locked out PERTH: "Not approved within the Workshops area" was the Midland Railway Workshops Manager's reply to the Joint Railway Unions' request for a lunchtime meeting to hear two Federal .Labor politicians address employees on Vietnam. The meeting then took place outside the main gate at which about 150 workers heard Sen ator J. Wheeldon (W.A.), M.H.R. for Stirling (W.A.) Harry Webb, and Senate candidate L. Wilkin son explain their party's con cern for the growing escalation of the war in Vietnam and its policy for a peaceful settlement to be negotiated now. This refusal by the Workshops management to allow the meet ing to take place inside the works is in line with the gen- eral policy being pursued by Liberal governments of black ing out the true facts about Vietnam and the rising world opposition to US-Australian in tervention there. It will be recalled that the Federal Government did not give State Education Depart ments or schools the democratic right to first say yea or hay to accepting or distributing the government's leaflet on Viet nam.
