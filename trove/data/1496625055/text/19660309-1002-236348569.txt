 USA admits loss' of four H-bombs Forty five days after the B52 bomber crashed in Spain, the United States has admitted that four thermo-nuclear weapons were on board and were lost. 'pHE US Defence Department is reported as saying that two bombs were blown apart; the third nuclear device (they refused to describe them as H-bombs) were found "vir tually" intact and 20 US naval vessels and thousands of US and Spanish troops and civil ians are searching for the fourth. ' The Sydney Morning Herald (March 4) reported a US auth ority as saying "We couldn't say anything officially until Spain made a move." ""No danger" There is little doubt, how ever, that the official silence from the date of the crash until March 3 has been an en deavor to hide the dangers of such accidents from the world's people. While stating that "no dan ger exists from explosions", the Atomic Energy Commission has stated that 1500 cubic yards of vegetation has been col lected in Spain and packed in to drums for dumping. Mundo Obrero, official organ of the Central Committee of the Spanish Communist Party, on February 5 published an article pointing out the havoc caused to the people by the accident and also a resolution demanding cessation of US plane flights over Spain when nuclear bombs are being car ried. Radiation Danger The dangers of radiation are intensified by the number of American bombs that have been lost. Recently the Sydney press reported that a large number of bombs had been lost in America, giving the names of the areas where they had been dropped. These reports have empha sised the need for a complete ban on manufacture of further nuclear wapons and the de struction of existing stockpiles.
