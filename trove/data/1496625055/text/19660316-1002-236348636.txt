 [?] With Tribune's Industrial Roundsman BREAK for a cup of afternoon tea is now enjoyed by many workers as a necessity. Metal workers employed by Arcos at Fairfield in Sydney have been battling for such a break and even sought to take it at their own expense. The Court said they can not as it is a "violation of the award". The fact is that the Metal Trades Award still does not even allow for a morning tea break. Metal workers "illegally" enjoy this right to a morning smoko. It was won by taking it over the years in the face of hostile employer opposition! ? JHE lads at Eveleigh rail way running sheds in Sydney have been getting about 15/- a week since 1963 as a "bonus" to compensate for bad conditions. This would be poor enough compensation as dirt money. But there is a lack of amen ities and there is poor light ing thrown in for good measure. Three days last week about 150 were on strike in protest against a move to take away this payment. The Railway Department no doubt thought a few improve ments justified wiping the "bonus." Now the Commissioner has agreed to continue the payment until all demolition work plus proper amenities and lighting are completed. ? CTEELWORKERS in New- castle tell of the BHP's "gratitude" to those who make the profits for them. After 50 years' service, a bloom mill worker was told he could not retire on Christmas Eve and expect to be paid for the holiday period. He would have to work the day after Boxing Day! Out of his $25 a. year "gift for service", strikes and layoffs were deducted. The time necessary to under go a serious operation and re cuperation was also deducted from his period of service.
