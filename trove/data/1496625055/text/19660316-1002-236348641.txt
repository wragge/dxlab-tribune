 Pay strike by Chinese crew pERTH: The twenty-nine Chinese crew members of the Norwegian freighter Mariko in the Port of Fremantle, went on strike on March 10th for in creased allowances. The Mariko is one of the foreign- flag charter vessels trading from Fremantle to North West ports. The Chinese in the' crew claim they signed a contract in Hong Kong to work in the ship for 18 months and have nine months to go. They are paid the equivalent of about $45 a month. They sup ply most of their bedding and eating utensils and because of the meagre provisions, pay back about ten per cent of their pay to supplement it. "The Seamen's Union and Waterside Workers Branch ful ly support the struggle of the Chinese crew" Des Dans, Sea men's Secretary told Tribune. "We are at present negotiat ing with their captain on their behalf. So far the captain has agreed to double the food pro vision. No further comment can be made until negotiations are finalised." Foreign flag ships on charter on the West Australian coast have been the subject of much concern and struggle. The Brand Government sus pended the relevant sections of the W.A. Marine Act to enable these ships to operate in coastal waters, thus posing a serious threat to the wages and condi tions of Australian maritime workers and preventing the ex pansion of the State Shipping Service. The Trades & Labor Council last year decided to support the maritime unions' struggle. Hie Seamen's Union view is that if Australian ships cannot do the job, then the crews of for eign ships in coastal trade should be paid at least Austra lian rates.
