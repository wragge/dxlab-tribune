 THE GHANA | ' WwJnaW ® GHANA: A victory j for reaction i I From ROGER MELUSS, who was in Accra, the Ghanaian capital, at the s time of the cossp. ® The sudden overthrow of President Nkrumah's government by f an army and police junta on February 24 was one of the most J severe setbacks the forces of progress in Africa have yet suffered. J Under Nkrcmah, ft-bR.Ttg was one or me Dasnons or the anti-imperialist strug gle in the under-developed world. He s&w clearly that Africa's only salvation, lay in achieving complete eco nomic political inde pendence from Western, capitalism and in eventual continental union govern ment. Internally, frhB,np was moving steadily towards the creation of a fully soc ialist. state. Acting with minutely planned precision, the army and police took advantage of Nkrumah's absence from Ghana on an important peace-making m-teci nn Vietnam to stage thai-- coup. Accte was shaken in the early hours of the morning I by two resounding explos- ions, as army forces &t- | tacked government head- | quarters in Flagstaff House. Violence | The leaders of the coup I claimed that their move | was bloodless — but it wasn't. | The wreckage of the mR-in I gates and the bullet holes | in Flagstaff House walls | testify to the violence of - the assault. | Units loyal to Nkrumah | held Dut until late in the I morning. .. Chief of Staff | Major General C. M. 3ar- | wah was one of those killed | — reliably reported to have J been bayoneted to death | when he refused to give | allegiance to the new re- | The socalled "National liberation Council", con- r sisting entirely of army n.nri | police officers under the I chairmanship of Lieut. Gen- j eral j. a. Ankrah — sacked : last year as Deputy Chief of Defence Staff — imme- diately announced the sus- | pension of the Constitu- i tion, the ditihn-nri rr>&lt;»ri 0f the Convention People's Party, and; the dismissal of I President Nkrumah. | It embarked c»n a sy&- | tematic round-up of Minis- - vers, parliamentarians, | party officials and region- j al and district commission- | STE. j New regime f The real nature of the | new regime became appar- | ent with two significant | developments a few days | after the Coup. Firstly, vir- 5 tually all Soviet experts I and technicians in Ghana, j together with their fami- I lies — numbering some 1200 I people in all — were ordered | to leave. I In addition, the regular I Moscow-Accra Aeroflot ser- J vice was suspended indefin- | itely, allegedly in retaliation | because Aeroflot flew I Nkrumah from Peking to | Moscow. | Secondly — and more im- I portantly — the new regime | took foreign and local cor- I respondents over a secret I "subversive" camp, buried in f the jungle, where Nkrumah | was allegedly training sabo- I teurs and insurgents to I overthrow "other" African | governments. | From reports in the Ghan- | ian press, which gave the | story sensational coverage, | it transpired that the "Af- ; rican" governments con- cerned comprised South i Africa, Rhodesia, Portu- I guest Guinea and the I Spanish island possession | of Fernando Po. | From this it is clear that the new regime intends, de spite vague lip-service to the nims of the Organisa tion of African Unity, to soft-pedal on the principle of anti-colonialism, and na tional liberation, if not to actively collaborate with the fascist colonial regimes in Southern Africa. Capitulate to the West There are several other etigns that the army and. police junta is planning to capitulate to the West and, under the guise of "restor ing democracy", impose re actionary economic and for eign policies in Ghana. This will mean a delib erate effort to break GhanE's strong links with the socialist- countries and to whip up an anti-com munist atmosphere. On the home front, it means an abandonment of Nkrumah's socialist policy F.nri a return to the free enterprise system, together with an open invitation to Western financial interests, over whose operations Nkrumah had kept a strict check by directing their in vestments into channels where they were most needed and requiring a substantial ploughing back into Ghana of profits gained. The new regime has taken over an economy which Nkrumah had already pro vided with a dynamic and viable base. Under Nkrumah, Ghana had made great economic progress, compared with the backwardness ana chaos of certain other African States, by the amount of indus trial development and by the comparatively higher standard of living — as well as the much lower number of beggars and cripples. A substantial state sector of the economy had been created, which Nkrumah en visaged as outstripping and eventually replacing the private sector. Capital in vestment — governmen t a 1, combined, state-private, and private — has been consider able. The Yolta River hydro electric scheme will by 1967 provide Ghana with surplus power to sell to neighbor ing countries, as well as satisfying the needs of a huge nVnTTvirritim combine. Other home industries — many of them state-owned — cover a wide range of manufactured products, and the embryo of a steel in dustry has commenced op erations. Ship line In addition, education — from primary to university level — has been made com pletely free, as has public health treatment. -Education and hospital facilities have expanded immensely. Water services have been provid ed in areas that never had them, and the country's road network greatly ex- . tended and improved.. Ghana has its own na tional shipping line and air company. No other African country can boast of such progress in such a sort time. At the same time, Ghana has run into serious eco nomic difficulties over the past few months. The coun try's once considerable for eign reserves have all but disappeared, due to over- 1 1 mm i mi !» — iwiwiii#! spending on capital projects, I a certain amount of "pres- 1 tige building" and a disas- | trous drop in the world price of cocoa-, Ghana's I main export earner. Food | prices have soared in re- j cent months, and there is ; a chronic shortage of con- sumer goods and spare | parts. | Food grant j from the US? I The new regime was able j to mobilise initial large- I scale support by promising I to rectify this position im- 1 mediately — especially by I lowering food prices and j increasing food supplies. It | will most likely do this by | obtaining a- grant, of sur- \ plus food from the USA, 1 which the Americans Te- 1 fused Nkrumah last Octo- | ber. I Another factor in the I new regime's winning pop- | ul&r support- has been the | adulatory worship of Nkru- g mah — referred to as "Osa- | gyefo" or "Redeemer" — | which was mainly created | by those around and under | him and which meant that everything, good and bad, | was done in his personal I name. Its destruction, al- J most overnight, proved that | this cult was as empty and S insubstantial as others f elsewhere. j In addition, events have = proved that the Convention j People's Party in actual fact | lacked a conscious and dis- i ciplined mass base, ana be- ! yond officials virtually did | not exist. » At the time of the coup, I Ghana was in transition | from a colonial -oriented so- I eiety to a socialist one, and I many of Nkrumah's sup- I posed supporters were in j fact opportunists and car- = eerists. But all this cannot de- j tract from Nkrumah's sta- | ture as one of Africa's | foremost anti - imperialist | leaders or from the measure | of his achievement in I Ghana itself. Such men are | not easily developed, and | the price the Ghanian peo- » pie pay for his demise may I be immense. j Only the West will benefit, ? in their struggle to con- f tain the national liberation j movement and defeat the | advance to socialism in f Africa. I West's role ! There is already consid- | erable evidence that the | Western powers may have actually been involved in j the February 24: coup. I In an effort to dispel | such rumors, Lieut. Gen. J Ankrah called a- press con- i ference last week in which ! he denounced the claims | of a Ghanian refugee | named Khow Amihyia that : he had master-minded the | coup from London with the | help of the CIA. 3ut Ank- g rah seemed to be protest- I ing too much. j The situation in Africa j grows more involved and g complex every day, as the | honeymoon of the inde- pendence struggle draws to | a close. I The events in Ghana f prove conclusively that re- | action is on the move in I the "third world" and that | the people of Africa must | he on their guard against g efforts by the Western pow- 1 ers and their local- servants J to fleece them of their | hard-won independence. | I MM i Mji i — i — — - I I Students at the Accra Trade School for girls in the I Republic of Ghana, before the recent coup.
