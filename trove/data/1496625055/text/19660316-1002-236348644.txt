 Unions reject wages colour bar p RISBANE Immediate payment of full award rates for Aborigines in the Northern Territory cattle industry, and provision of similar rights for Aborigines in the pastoral industry in Queensland, are sought by the Queensland Trades and Labor Council. The T & LC is opposed to the intended delay of almost three years in the operation of the Commonwealth Arbi tration Commission award announced last week, and to other discriminatory features to Aborigines' disadvantage. The T & LC says also that the State Government should act immediately to provide full award wages and conditions to all Aborigines working in the Queensland cattle industry. The Commonwealth Arbitra tion Commission in its decision last week said that the provi sion for Northern Territory Aboriginal workers in the cattle industry to get the same pay as white workers would not come into effect until De cember 1, 1968. Even then, Aborigines whom their employers class as "slow workers" may still be denied the full rate. The T & LC is seeking a special meeting of the inter state executive of the Austra lian Council of Trade Unions ' to discuss ways of protecting the position of Aborigines in the Northern Territory.
