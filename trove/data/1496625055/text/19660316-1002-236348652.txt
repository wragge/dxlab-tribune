 A crime to give food away! By the Industrial Roundsman JYDNEY: It seems to be a crime or "discredible conduct" for someone to prevent the destruction of foodstuff! Dump it! — bury it! — burn it! BUT you cannot give it away to people who can use it! If you venture to do such a thing, and happen to be an officer of the Fire Brigade, your crime can also "bring discredit on the reputation of the bri gade" — and you may be dis missed. Such is the penalty hanging over the district officer at Crow's Nest station, on the north side of Sydney, who is undergoing trial at the hands of the Fire Brigade Depart ment. And because of it, the fire brigade boys on the north side are hopping mad. Here are the facts: — Following a fire at Norman's Foodland Store, Pacific High way, Lindfield last December 2, about $16,000 worth of slightly damaged groceries were earmarked to be dumped. The insurance company rep resentative was making these arrangements as the above company carried a loss-of- profits policy. Rather than see such wanton waste, the fire officer fcaid $20 for the goods for which he received a receipt. After finishing duty, he and other firemen proceeded to dis pose of the "rubbish". Truck loads were given to charities which included the Margaret Reid Orthopaedic Hos pital and the Barnardo Homes. Brigade vehicles were not used for this. Then to the delighted aston ishment of the local residents, they were invited (free of charge) to help themselves. Many insisted on leaving a small donation. This money was then donated : to the Spastic Centre and a receipt and thanks received. fOOTNOTEs Tribune does not ne- eessorily support the practice of goods" dispos!ng f f 're damaged . Such goods, if passed by health T!Pectors' should be put to use in an appropriate way, not wasted.
