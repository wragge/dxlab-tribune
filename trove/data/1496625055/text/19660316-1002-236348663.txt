Not all of the Junior Trib- une readers nave the time to spare irum wieir soiuih stuuira to join in the competitions, however they may have a poem, story or drawing they have done tucked away in s drawer or scrap book. Don't keep your talent to your self, share it with sll the Junior Tribune readers and make our section bright and interesting. The winners of the drawing competition of Mummy are Carol Gillett (4i) of Sth. Aust. and Key Wollschlager (10) of N.S.W. Looking forward to receiving all your letters. Best wishes. Dinewan
