 "Night of the Auk" SYDNEY New Theatre's next production, "Night of the Auk" by American play- wright Arch Obler, is set in the interior of a space capsule returning to Earth afte!- landing on the moon. The play is more than just another space travel or science fiction drama because, though set in the future, it speaks for today, with, the question implied: What lies before humanity? Will there be a future? The answer is found in the personalities and ambitions of the space travellers, and their sense of responsibility to the human race. In January 1964 "Night of the Auk" was screened by the A.B.C. as one in a "Play1 of the Week" series made by the U.S. National Television Association. In the screen version the part of Lewis Rohnen was played by William Shatner, who later be came well known to Australian viewers as the young attorney in the popular series "For the People."
