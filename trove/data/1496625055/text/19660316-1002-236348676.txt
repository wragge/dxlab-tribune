 Teachers shouldn't collect CYDNEY: The NSW Teachers Federation has advised teachers not to collect fares on special buses for school children. President of the federation, Mr. S. Lewis, said this in struction was issued by the State Council in opposition to teachers and/or senior pupils acting as "conduc tors". A deputation from the federation raised objections to this practice with officials of the Transport Department last week. The federation was told that if teachers do not collect the fares, the department will not provide Special buses for sports days, etc. The federation has asked that free travel be. provided within school hours with no cost to children or schools. "This would be a limited application of the Premier's pre-election promise," Mr. Lewis said. The matter will now be directly taken up with the Premier (Mr. Askin) and school staffs will also contact MHR'S. Bus employees said this practice is breaking the law. Among other things, con ductors carry a police licence and have responsibility for safety. They also claim the main reason why the department i,s 347 conductors short is due to unattractive wages and condi tions. A recent mass meeting at the Waverley Bus .depot con demned the practice of using teachers as conductors and has referred the matter to the Bus Employees' Union.
