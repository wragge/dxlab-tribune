 Top architect attacks Govt. YDNEY Opera House designer Mr. Joern Utzon was being used as a scapegoat by ' the NSW Government to cover its own muddling and it was "perpetuating a campaign against him with the viciousness of a military operation". A leading Sydney architect, Mr. Harry Seidler, said this to a meeting of over 2000 peo ple at the Sydney Town Hall, last Monday. The meeting was organised by the "Utzon in Charge Commit tee," of which Mr. Seidler is a leading member. \ Many leading people, includ ing architects', university lectur ers, professors, designers and authors addressed the meeting that lasted nearly two hours. . Mr. Seidler said the Govern ment was capitalising on the position into which they had! forced Mr. Utzon. The normal cooperation be tween a client and an architect did not exist between the Gov ernment and Mr. Utzon, he said. Payments due to him had been stopped and naturally he had no alternative but to stop work. Government spokesmen had then gone to the press claiming that he had resigned, after they had made work for him im possible, Mr. Seidler added. He said that Mr. Utzon was m the same position as an architect commissioned to de sign a dam with only one road to the site. If the client cut off this road, work would cease. Dealing with costs he said that the original estimate was made without consultation with the architect and when no one knew much about struc tural and engineering problems. The structural consultants have a separate contract with the Government for the roof and the increase in the estim ates from $3.6 million to $11.2 million was their responsibility, not that of Mr. Utzon. "The facts have been colored maliciously," Mr. Seidler said. To hand the Opera House project over to a panel of archi tects would result in the "great est mess ever," Mr. Seidler said.
