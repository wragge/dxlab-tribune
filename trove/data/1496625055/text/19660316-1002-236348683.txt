 TECH. EXPERTS SPEAK OUT ON TRAINING ! pERTH: Spotlighting the tremendous advances made in technology and science in this space age, Technical Training Year 1966 opened in Perth on March & with a VIP visit by American astronauts Schirra and Borman and their wives. But ;the effectiveness of space capsules, tracking sta tions and new materials rely.., as much on the labor skill of workers as on the scientist and technologist. Are the facilities and conditions for developing labor skill in Western -Australia up -to today's needs? Tribune went to the people most concerned to find out. A SENIOR TRADE INSTRUCTOR AT A TECH NICAL SCHOOL: ' "The syllabus, extent of courses and standard of equipment for apprenticeship training has improved a lot. "A chronic shortage of funds for buildings and equip ment is seriously hampering our efforts. "At the Fremantle Tech., for instance, seven instructors and 250 apprentices in one trade occupy the same floor area as one instructor and 50 apprentices did in years gone by. "A full-time trade instructor's training course is long overdue. Instruction in trade skills is as important as other fields of education. "Modifications of apprenticeships are necessary to keep up with the times. The old 5-year system is suited to the 1850's when it was first introduced. . . v "The change made in some trades to a shortened three and four-year indenture after one to one and a half' years full-time study at a tech. is far better than the old 5-year apprenticeship when the first year, in the main, is spent 'boiling the billy'." EX-HAIRDRESSING APPRENTICE: "I had to leave work after I got married when I was expecting my first baby. I was not allowed to complete the apprenticeship on a part-time or evening school basis. "There are no child-minding centres to take care of my children even if I had been able to take up the apprenticeship where I left off."
