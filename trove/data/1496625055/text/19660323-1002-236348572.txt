 Big gallery at wage hearing MELBOURNE : The Arbitration Commission public gallery was filled last week by industrial and white collar workers, during the hearing of the Aus tralian Council of Trade Unions' claim of 4 dollars 30 cents increase in the basic wage and 5 dollars 90 cents increase in .margins. Mr. R. Hawke, the ACTU advocate, analysed last year's decision in detail and sentence by sentence revealed that the majority ruling was unjust, un acceptable and had not suc ceeded in checking prices or stabilising the economy, but had in fact reduced the real wage of the worker. Mr. Hawke's careful and considered arguments were compared by onlookers with Judge Gallagher's outbursts and insults in calling, the ACTU. advocate a- "Domain Demos thenes or Hyde Park Cicero", especially after the bench had demanded an apology from Mr. Paterson. Last year Judge Gallagher stated that all strikes were un constitutional, and when Mr. Hawke defended the principle of the right to strike he we-s accused of condoing strikes. Mr. Hawke has explained to the Commission that award wages mean nothing as a money amount, that they have signi ficance only in terms, of goods and services which they en able the wage earner to buy. As the output of goods and services per head of population increases, award wages will not be just or reasonable if they do not give the wage earner power to purchase more goods. The majority decision was bad in .principle, ignored eco nomic realities, and was biased against the unions, said Mr. Hawke. A just a.nd reasonable wage could only be achieved if the Commission took account of rising - prices. Judge Gallagher said that it was "never the majority's in tention to exclude prices from consideration altogether.; all that was intended was that wages should not go up because prices went up."
