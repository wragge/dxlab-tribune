 Woollahra Council increases rates: Council rejects rates petition gYDNEY : The Woollahra Council, which on Janu ary 24 T rejected a petition signed by residents in the suburb, calling for abolition of a $50 annual min imum rate, has since failed to reply to a further petition. Recently residents formed the Fair Rents and Rates Committee as a result of the growing awareness in the area at the injustice of the minimum rate imposed by the Council last year. Committee members canvas sed "the area with a petition and in about three hours collected over 230 signatures. This was about 100 per cent of the houses canvassed. Alderman T. White presented the petitions to the Council. The matter was discussed, tabledâ€”and rejected. The Committee in a press statement described this action as "grossly unjust". It added .that many of the residents who had signed the petition had said that the minimum rate had im posed a heavy financial burden particularly among pensioners. . One elderly woman had toldi them that her municipal rate had been $6.50 seven years ago. Introduction of the minimum rate had lifted it by about four times. The Committee has since col lected further signatures and submitted them to the Council, on February 14. So far no reply has been re ceived.
