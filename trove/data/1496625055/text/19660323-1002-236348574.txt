 I That I I TV I j show ! j SYDNEY: The sec- j ond part of the j | Channel Seven Sydney ( i TV Drofirram on the I . „ — , | Communist Party of j | Australia was some- jj | thing of an. anti- j i climax. | | . Like the first part (as I j stated in Tribune last ! j week) the program, made j j for the Seven Days ses- j I sion by Mr. Peter Wester- | | way, contained some use- I j ful documentary film j ' about communists in Syd- | I ney, which had been shot ! j with the permission and g | full co-operation of the | - G.P.A. central committee, g | The second program also I | featured interviews with a j | number of professional j j anti-communists- ! i These were . unremark- jj f | able samples of the regu- j | lar anti-communist fare to ! j be found on most channels | I every week "or so,' aiid they: j vi - were enlivened only by a jj i short film of the Anti- S ? Communist Crusade i,n ac- | | tion in Cincinatti, U.S.A., | j an extraordinary phoney ! = performance reminiscent I I of the breast-beating and j | souped-up psalm-singing 1 i of other religious char- I latans so well-known in I U.S. society. | The program reached its » lowest ebb, perhaps, with | | clips of fj,lm obviously on Iloan from secret police 1 files, taken during the j Petrov Commission and j | later, purporting to show j | Russian spies in Australia ! and implying without basis j | that communists were as- | jj sociated with them. S | Most pitiful of all was I I a stilted film interview j | with a self-confessed secu- I | rity police plant, in an Ade- I ! laide C.P.A. branch in the j early 1950's, Mrs. Anne 2 j Neiu- ! | If the security police | j (and Channel 7) cannot do I 1 better than this in 1966, j | after 15 years, they must g 1 indeed be hard up. 1 I However, once again, | | the general impression of j | the commentary was that | j the makers of the program I i failed to rise to the possi- j I bilities of really effective, g ! objective, documentary ! | that had been made avail- j I able to them. g ! Nevertheless, the truth j | emerged both visually j i and in parts of the com- j | mentary that communists I J are not only "normal Aus- I I tralian people" but are | I concerning themselves I | about the issues of im- S | portance to the Australian j | people — peace, a better j | living standard and a bet- g j ter society ,n future. J | Both sessions ended on j s the note that those who 1 want to understand what 1 | makes communists tick $ | can do it only by study- g j mg the policies and aims I | of the communists in the I I Tribune and other com- I munist publications. g \ Who can quarrel with \ I that? Certainly not the j g communists.— A.R. |
