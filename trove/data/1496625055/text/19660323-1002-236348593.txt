 The ECM again JTRANCE'S dropping of her long-standing veto on Britain's entry into the European Common Mar ket is very important to Australia. So are the indications by British Labor and Tory leaders that they favor entry on certain conditions. In 1962, the Market countries were demanding, as price for Britain's entry, the end of Common wealth trade preferences in British markets. The . present Tory leader, Heath, then the main nego tiator for the Macmillan Government, seemed ready to pay the price. Long before De Gaulle imposed his veto in Jan uary, 1963, the Communist Party of Australia in 1 962 called on all working people and their organi sations to act to protect Australia against what appeared to be the threat of Britain's surrender to the Common Market. At stake were Australian primary exports to the British market, which, excluding wool, .hve varied in value from $340 to $400 million. Australian meat, dairy products, wheat, sugar, fruit and eggs were among the commodities whose future was threatened. Despite some changes in the trade pattern, there is nothing to suggest that the threat is any less serious three years later. Now, as Chen, major steps required include: increased trade arrangements with the socialist countries (whose economies are stable and develop ing rapidly) ; and abandonment of the use of mili tary force in Asia, to make way for treaties of friendship, trading and other exchanges with south east Asian countries.
