 Head fax no answer NUMBER of people have advanced the view that a more equitable form of finance raising for Councils is for a head tax — say, $10 each— be imposed on all adult citizens. The NSW Local Government Association claims that 55 per cent, of adults pay rates, therefore 45 per cent, get Council services "free." This seems a reasonable claim and, of course, could quickly increase Councils' revenue. But how just is. it? More workers today own land compared to pre-war times, but they do so out of necessity to get a house, and this is the working man's rea son for becoming a ratepayer. However, people who pay rent also pay rates. The land lord makes sure of this. Then, who are the 45 per cent., who do not pay rates? The husband or wife of the ratepayer and their children over 21 years of age would be a big proportion. I don't be lieve that we can support this "head tax" scheme, particularly in view of pegged wages, rising prices and increased taxation. We should look for increased rates, but from those most able to afford it. Councils could increase their income if the Local Government Act is changed to allow the institu tion of a graduated rating system. This should begin at the lowest scale for home owners and rise to heavier rating for profit-making enterprises in the area. This will only be brought about by strong pressure from the people, from trade unions and other organisations, in cluding Councils. The latter have to be convinced that this is the most equitable method of increased rates. M. BURNHAM, Sydney (NSW).
