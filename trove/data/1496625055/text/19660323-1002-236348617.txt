 Farmers act against Country Party PERTH: West Australia's 10,000 members ,of the Farmers' Union threaten to withdraw support from Country Party members of Parliament. This is implied in the overall tenor of reports, debate and resolutions at the just concluded annual conference of the union. Resentment at Government charges, which are the main factor in steeply rising farm costs, was at simmer- ing point throughout the conference. i Demands were raised for a change in traditional policy which debars official alignment with any political party. This is not far short of an open ultimatum to the Country Party MPs. lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllililllillllil
