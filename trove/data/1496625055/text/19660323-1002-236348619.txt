 Vietnam jgEING inattentive and un observant when it comes to subjects that demand my attention, I do not know the whole situation in Vietnam. I do know, however, that my feeling towards it are anger and disgust. Could the participants in the Vietnam war come home with pride and say "Look ivhat we've done for our country?" What of the future? Will Australians wake up to them selves and forget that might is right? D. R., Manly (NSW)
