 France leaves NATO ONDON: As expect ed, the French de cision to leave the North Atlantic Treaty Organ- isation and to exclude its bases from France has touched off demands in other NATO countries that they do likewise. In Britain and Turkey, at least, the statement by French foreign minister Couve de Murville that France could not follow an independent for eign policy while it remained, in NATO has found an echo. The London Daily Worker asks "Why should Britain be the first to leap to NATO's defence against De Gaulle?" The. paper points out that 1 De Gaulle is reasserting France's sovereignty and standing up to the Americans. If he, a defender of French big business, can do this, how much more necessary is it for a Labor Government to take an independent line. "Mr. Wilson makes speeches about Britain's world role. But we are universally look ed on as America's lackey. "We have even more inter est than the French in get ting rid of the US bombers, submarines and troops from our soil, "Far from boosting NATO we should call for its dissolu tion. This would make pos sible the simultaneous wind ing-up of. the Warsaw Treaty Organisation and the estab lishment of a European secur ity treaty. "Even Franco has been compelled to ban US nuclear flights over Spain, following ;on the crash of a US bomber there. But the bombers still fly over Britain. The US air bases are still here. The Pai- aris base is still at Holy Loch." The commentators of two Turkish papers write favor ably of France's stand and in fer that Turkey should follow suit. "De Gaulle's attitude is valid for us, too, because we too have two NATO head quarters and many US mili tary bases on our soil" says a writer in Cumhuriet.
