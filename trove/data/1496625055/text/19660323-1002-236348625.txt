 Big strike oyer cheap mail sorting QVER 8,000 mail officers throughout Australia will strike for 24 hours from midnight next Thurs day in protest against the introduction of "cheap labor" to operate sorting machines. The strike has been called by the Amalgamated Postal Workers' Union following a breakdown in negotiations with the postmaster- Gener al's Department. The department plans to employ junior girls to operate electronic letter sorting mach_ ines in Sydney at lower rates of pay. Eventually these machines will be introduced in all States, These girls are to receive about $14 a week less than that now paid to men. The union's Federal Presi dent (Mr. F. Waters) said that wherever this kind of equip ment has been introduced overseas it has been operated by mail officers at the male rate of pay. "Overseas there is no dis crimination between the sexes," he said. The union's NSW mail branch council has called on the Federal executive to re commend that next Friday's stopwork meetings in each State place a ban on overtime from .the date of the stop page. Other proposals from the Council include : Placing a. black ban on all mails sorted by anyone except trained mail officers. An immediate stoppage of all members, including post men and linesmen, if any mail officer is penalised. The NSW executive is seek ing the support of all NSW unions against the Federal Government's "irresponsible at titude to automation". The executive stresses "the dangerous precedent to other unions if the Government suc_ ceeds in its plans to discard the existing designation of mail officer and man the machines with downgraded cheap labor."
