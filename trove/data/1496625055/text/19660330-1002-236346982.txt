 Thousands sign petition to reduce high prices SYDNEY: Thousands of people in Sydney sub urbs last Saturday signed the NSW Labor Council's petition urging the State Government to control and reduce prices. At the Sydney suburb of Revesby about 70 people in an "Operation Doorknock", collected between 2,500-3,000 signatures. Canvassers were members of trade unions and women's and pensioners' organisations. The main organiser was Mr. M. MacFarlane. The petition will be presented today (Wednesday) to the State Government. Also canvassed was a ques tionnaire on prices, to which scores of people responded. Answers to the questionnaire showed that wages were being drastically affected by price rises from baby food to toilet paper, rates to household re pairs and .cosmetics to enter tainment. As one householder put it: "They're even getting at us through out pets." A signatory to the petition, Mrs. Warwick of Revesby, said that it was about time some thing was done to put a stop to the robbery .taking place through price increases and the decimal changeover. "A friend of mine just last week bought three pies at 12 cents each. "The old currency price was used to calculate the total 3 x 1-3 equals 3/9 and this convert ed to decimal currency came to 38 cents instead of 36 cents," said Mrs. Warwick, giving an example of currency change over robbery. At Newcastle last Saturday, over 1,000 signatures for the N.S.W. Labor Council petition were collected. A number of street meetings were held. Speakers included Mr. Ray Miller, president of the New- csatle Trades and Labor Coun cil, Dick Scott, Federal Assistant Secretary of the Blacksmiths' and Boilermakers' Society and Pat Clancy, state secretary of the .Building Workers' Industrial Union.
