 NSW nurses I battle for wage justice j By our Industrial Roundsman : J YDNEY : Over 3,000 nurses made the lower Sydney Town Hall thunder last week, stamping and shouting their support | for their association's secretary, Mr. L. Hart, 1 when he said : "We cannot strike and this is used against us. But the public in NSW has a vote and we will ask them J to vote the Government out if nurses don't get wage iustice !" '$ This— the first mass meet ing ever called by the NSW Nurses Association— became one of the biggest and liveli est demonstrations held by any union. These overworked and under paid women and girls had liter ally run out of patience. Their dedicated caring for the sick has been carried out against a background of low- wages and long hours reflecting shocking exploitation. After paying board, taxation and other expenses, a first or second year trainee nurse gets about $10 a week. A first year nursing sister receives $36.55 and after 15 . years service can get no more than $45.10. 43 hospitals This is why the Sydney Town Hall was jammed packed with protesting nurses, from 43 Syd ney and country public . hos pitals. Many arrived in 32 special buses, others by train or car, while 16 lasses from the Suther land District Hospital walked the 15 miles to show the pub lic their determination. A deafening acclamation of approval was given them when they arrived at the meeting. Then the meeting got down to business. No formal vote for or against any proposal had to be taken. The lasses and their older sisters left no doubt how they felt. They .didn't have to be told that in some hospitals their tasks included cooking, washing, emptying garbage bins apart from their normal duties. Or that a maid at a hospital gets $6 to $10 a week more than a nurse plus penalty rates for overtime. They know that nurses in other States do only three years' training and get much higher wages. They know, too, that low .Vi; wages in NSW has resulted in a serious shortage of nursing staff, which adds further bur- dens to the dedicated. And every hospital patient must also know this is the r reason why they are aroused M at some ungodly hour of the morning for their wash or have to wait hours for routine at tention. I I Deputation Loud . hisses indicated that nurses knew they were being "treated with contempt" by the M people who fix their wages. M They had not even received 'J the 10 per cent margin increases % granted to most other workers . some 18 months ago. Jl The last straw was the re- || cent paltry wage offer of 60c if increase for a third year nurse to $2 for a fifth year sister and m nothing for a first or second M year trainee. ifl " . >') &lt;«!/.. i-.
