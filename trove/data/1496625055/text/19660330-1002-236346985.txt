 UP GOES THE INDICATOR ! By JUNE MILLS SYDNEY: Thanks to the good response j to our appeal for an extra effort to reach the $1,000 mark, we are able to push that little black mark up the ladder this week. With only one quarter of the year gone and with the assistance of all our regular donors and help from new readers, partic- I ularly in other States, it seems to- me that we should be able to reach the $1,500 by the end of June. Then we'll set a new target for the second half of the year. So let us hear from all the readers who so far have not sent us that dollar. Remem ber, all the Fund money helps with the production of Tribune. I Donations this week: ! M.B.
