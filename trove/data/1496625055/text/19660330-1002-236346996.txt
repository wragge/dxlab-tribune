 Dangers of State Aid JYDNEY: The so-call- ed State Aid issue in the recent Labor Party dispute was a convenient vehicle for the careerist aims of Mr. E. G. Whitlam and others to capture the ALP leader ship. This is stated by Mr. J. R. Hughes in an article in the April issue of the Com. munist Review. The article points out that important forces influencing the extreme rightwing in the labor movement were not only "not happy with Whitlam as a leader" but also concerned about this use . of State aid, which can arouse sectarian bitterness that could act un favorably to their aims. The article draws attention to the policy recently an nounced by Labor leader A, Calwell. It says his proposal of $1 a head per. week educa- tiohal endowment "could be a useful addition to the ALP program and is deserving of more analysis thaoi the out of hand condemnation meted out by the press and some spokes men of the Catholic Church. "The proposal has the ad vantage of hot being State aid to institutions at the expense of State schools but of assistance to parents of all school child ren". The writer , points, .out thafc the rightwing Catholic' SahtS-"" maria in his book. "Price of Freedom" deplores the use of the phrase "State Aid" and says he prefers "equal treat- meant for all children from the public revenues irrespective of the school attended."
