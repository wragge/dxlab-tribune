 Making it hot at home QONSCR1PTION protest- i ers have taken to burning their draft cards during demonstrations out side the private homes of Federal Cabinet mem bers. In Melbourne last Saturday morning about 70 young sup porters of the Youth Campaign Against Conscription cheered as three of their number burnt their draft cards outside the Toorak home of the Prime Min ister (Mr. Holt). One of the Melbourne demon strators paraded in a snorkel and flippers and when asked why, said "it symbolises Holt being out of his depth in deep water on conscription." The demonstrators carried placards demanding an end to conscription and telling Holt to "Stick to killing fish." Reply to Bury In Sydney on Sunday a young man replied to Labor Minister Bury's threat to prosecute draft- card burners by burning his card in front of Bury's Vau- cluse (Sydney) Irome. He was one of 50 Eureka Youth League members who held a peace demonstration at the home. Bury refused to see a deputa tion, but his wife took delivery of a letter. A week ago in Parliament Bury threatened that action wouia oe taaen against your.n.s suspected of breaches of the national service act. In Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth and Brisbane also demonstra tions were held against the Vietnam war last weekend. Nazi in crowd At the Sydney State Theatre Church rally against conscrip tion last Sunday a bodyguard of Arthur Smith, "leader" of the Australian nazis, was seen trying (vainly) to organise a hostile demonstration against Dr. J. F. Cairns MHR, one of the speakers. ;. Though the heckling was constant, all speakers were I clearly heard.
