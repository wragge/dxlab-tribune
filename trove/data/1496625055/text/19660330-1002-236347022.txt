 Executions in Vietnam gOME idea of the ruth- lessness and savagery of the Ky regime in South Vietnam may be gleaned from the report of the summary execution w profiteers. W.thout doubt these offen ders merit severe punish ment, but I do not agree that profiteering warrants the death sentence and summary execution without any chance of appeal. If wartime profiteering merits the death sentence then theie should have been quite a number in this and other allied countries shot during the last war, and I could name a few not only in U.S.A. but also here in Australia who come under this category, at the present time. One wonders if thi;. is the type of "democracy" we are fighting to install in Vietnam. Alex Patersqn, (NSW North Coast).
