 Row over U.S. base contracts DERTH: Dozens of firms and individuals, mostly from West Australia, who have done sub-contracting work for the U.S. Radio Base pro ject at Nor' West Gape, are still waitintr fnr their monev. some for over 12 months. Total amount involved could be more than $5 million. Defence Minister Fairhall said 1 in Parliament last week that I the Australian . Government I could do nothing to help. 1 The contracts were for the 1 U.S. Government, but local peo- 1 pie dealt with the main contrac- E tors, and had to use ordinary 1 business prudence by looking into the credit rating of the I organisation. Hopeless tangle Flatly disagreeing with this, WA. Chamber of Manufactur ers' President Cullity said the effective credit rating was the fact that the contractor was acceptable to the U.S. Navy. Our own governments had encouraged Australian firms to take part "to help a matter of national importance." . The whole position is enmesh ed in a hopeless legal tangle which may never be fully straightened out. Firstly, the prime contractors Hardier-Mbnier-Hutcherson were in financial difficulties, and had passed control of the job to another closely linked company j Concrete (Monier) Industries I (Australian). . I Secondly, the US Navy is dis- | puting accounts for over $5 mil- 1 lion for so-called extras to the original contract of $66 million for Stage One of the project.
