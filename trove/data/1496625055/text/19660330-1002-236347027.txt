 WWF calls for pay increase C YDNEY : Over 2,000 waterside workers at their stopwork meeting last week called on shipowners to agree to an interim increase in the hourly pay rate when the next session of the all-in , conference meets early in April. The meeting said that wharf earnings over the past 37 weeks are from $8 to $16 a week less compared with the same period in 1963-64. A resolution said that the re fusal to date of the shipowners and the Stevedoring Industry Authority to grant a six-hour rate attendance money, and the continuing imposition and. col lection of attendance money fines, is causing many young men -to leave the industry. Waterside workers each re ceived about 3(F days' attend ance money' fines imposed by the ASIA during the disputes last year. I This means the 28/3 a day attendance money paid when ho work is available is not paid until the fines are cancelled out. Last week's meeting said the persistence by the ASIA and Government in imposing this penalty is not only causing hardship with wharf families, but is reacting against the authority by causing young experienced waterside workers to be lost to the industry. A protest was also made at the sharp decline in the rela tive value of attendance money. This has fallen from an equivalent to four hours' pay in 1947 to less than 2i hours pay today. "Our campaign for a just attendance money of six hours' pay to provide a reasonable security is losing instead of gaining ground," the meeting said. Members were called on to strengthen the unity of the Sydney Branch of the Water side Workers' Federation around the outstanding claims of the Federation and the trade union movement. The meeting said the main issues facing the workers are wages, prices and Vietnam. "The latter, as well as in volving Australia in an unjust war causing economic hardship to the Australian working people, is now challenging the vital Australian democratic principle of anti-conscription."
