 Workers rebuff conscriptionist SYDNEY: By a majority of some 600 to six, Chullora Electric Car shop workers voted against conscription after a lunch- hour debate last Wednesday. They did so after some I surprising admisions by the pro-conscription speaker, Mr. Michael Darby. He agree?: that there was corruption in the South Vietnam Government Aus tralians were being conscrip ted to defend. "South VJetnam is riddled with many evils'', he admitted. Replying to a worker, Mr. Darby also agreed that Aus tralia was in nc danger of invasion by the "Vietcong". â€ž Replying to another question he said that there- were "100 ways of getting out" of the draft by those who did not want to serve. Mi. Darby said that by fighting we obtained a lever with which to compel thb Americans to clean ' up cor ruption and institute democ racy in South Vietnam. When M!r.- Darby said America had1 no interest in fighting in Vietnam, a worker quoted ex-president Eisen hower's 'statement that the U9 depended on it for tin and tungsten. The workers were courteous to Mr. Darby, but gave the biggest applause to Mr. Barry Robinson, of the Youth . Cam paign against Conscription, who said conscription, was violation of the conscience of the individual. In the same day's Sydney Morning Herald Darby was described as acting chairman of a group of Young Liberals and DLP members which has tried to disrupt peace meet ings.. Darby was reported as hav ing read to the Herald re porter sections of the Crimes Act prescribing life imprison ment for "treachery". He said: "That would shut these people up". The workers gave 20-year- old Mi. Darby a lesson in democracy. They didn't use his own disruptive tactics against him, or try to "shut him up" for life, but gave him a fair hearing and even some polite handclaps. Then, by about 10 to one, they voted against him.
