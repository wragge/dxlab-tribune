 Maggots in food causes strike L A u N C ESTON: Over 100 COxi struction workers em ployed on the Savage River iron ore project icvciVillg Â£ further batch of mag got infested sand wiches from their US boss (Bechtel Pacific) became really savage, and went on strike. They all threw their sandwiches into a wheel barrow, then they wheeled the lot into the office of the Yank superviser, and dumped the fly-blown heap right in the middle of the floor. The following day, the men voted to strike at a meeting held at 7 a.m., the time they normally start work. It was pointed out that while the relatively com fortable supervisory staff had been supplied with hot lunches, the men (who are working 11 hours a day, seven days a week) were receiving nothing but sandwiches during the day. The strikers are demand ing a hot meal during the day and hygienic condi tions for food preparation. The workers were build ing the cookhouse when they went on strike. The present temporary cook house is in a converted dormitory. The employer has sim ply refused to negotiate and insists on the men returning to work first. ,
