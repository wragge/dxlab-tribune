 Printers amalgamate : "Money can't beat us now" YDNEY : The two biggest printing unions in Australia officially amalgamated last week at a ceremony in Sydney. These unions, the Printing Industry Employees' Union of Australia (40,000 members) and the Amalgamated Printing Trade FmnlnvÂ«c' Union of Australia (10,000) have now merged as the Printing and Kindred Industries Union. pEDERAL Councillors of both unions signed the amalga mation agreement on March 31, bringing to an end negotiations which first began in 1922. Australian Council of Trade Unions' President, Mr. A. Monk, ' who witnessed the ceremony, described the amalgamation as an historic occasion. He said amalgamation is the objective of the ACTU . . . "to bring about industrial unionism which will eventually replace craft unionism." Mr. Monk pointed out that there were a few more unions in the printing industry which could be brought in. The Federal secretaries of the former unions, Messrs. C. Colborne (PIEUA) and A. Fifield (APTEU) will be joint secretaries of the new organisa tion. Mr. Colborne said the move throughout the world is for bigger and stronger unions. "Last week, on the eve of our amalgamation, the Master Printers have been busy trying to strengthen their State federa tions. "But money can't beat us now! "They cannot cut up the trades to their own advantage now we are amalgamated. "We will make the decisions now, not. the employers," he said. Mr. Fifield said that in the past whenever the two unions acted independently they often suffered defeat. "But whenever joint action was taken, as in the 40-hour week strike we were successful. "With big changes taking place in the industry the em ployers wanted to see our two unions fighting each other." He pointed out that in large establishments in Sydney "the unions in fact amalgamated some years ago through joint meetings on the job. "In some way our member ships forced us to amalgamate," he said.
