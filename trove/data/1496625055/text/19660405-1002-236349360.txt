 MSB workers in wage action SYDNE\ : All Maritime Services Board workers throughout the port cf Sydney will hold a four-hour steppage tomorrow (Wednesday) in support of a$6 a week wage increase. During the stoppage a protest demonstration and meeting will be held outside the Board's offices In Sydney. The fcur-hour stoppage was authorised by the NSW labor Council's disputes committee following 14 months of un successful negotiations over the claim. The claim was first made over 14 months ago by a mass meeting covering 12 unions at Gcat island in the Sydney Harbor. This claim the workers said wan in line with similar over- award payments being received at other waterfront workshops. Goat Island is used by the MSB tc repair its launches and other small craft. The claim has now also spread to other MSB workers, including building and metal trades and launch drivers. During earlier approaches to the then NSW Labor Govern- and the MSB, the unions were told tc take the claim to arbitration. A recent deputation of workers sought an interview with Premier Askin who was "too busy to see them." He also would not see the unions. Following these rebuffs, a mass meeting of the Goat Isiand men had called for a stoppage of all MSB workers.
