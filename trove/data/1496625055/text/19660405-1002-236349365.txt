 Aust. journalist wins world award OS COW : Wilfred Burchett, though denied for some years the .Australian passport to which he is entitled by birth and citizenship, turned up in Paris to receive his world journalism prize for courageous and objective reporting of the Vietnam liberation struggle. Burchett's photo on the front page of the French daily, l'Humanite, is a reminder that, the French Government does not join the Australian Government in victimis- ?ng this Australian inter national prize winner. The main prizes are sponsor ed by the International Organis ation of Journalists. Madeleine Riffaud, a French journalist, also- received an award for work in reporting Vietnam. Many other journalists were present, including Algerian writ er Henri Alleg, first winner of the IOJ award, and l'Humanite editor Etienne Fajon. IOJ president Jean-Maurice Herman paid tribute to Bur chett as the first western journalist to enter Hiroshima after the bomb fell and as a correspondent in Berlin and socialist countries. Referring to the US crimes in south Vietnam, Herman said the duty of journalists was to expose all the facts about such crimes and to breach the wall of lies with which they were covered. This was what Bur chett and Madeleine Riffaud had done. Replying, both Burchett and Miss Riffaud said they would donate the money accompany ing the prize to the journalists of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front. â€” R. Lockwood and TASS.
