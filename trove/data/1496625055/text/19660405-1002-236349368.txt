 Campaign to win sewerage system DEL AIDE: A meeting of 150 ratepayers in the Semaphore Park ward of the Woodville Council decided last week to campaign for the more speedy introduction of a seweraere svstem. The meeting was addressed by Mr. R. Hurst, ALP Mem ber for the district, and chaired by Councillor Jim Mitchell. After hearing Mr. Hurst re port on the problems of sew ering the area and the scheme for the upper reaches of the Port River, many residents were critical at the. delays and the difficulties arising from septic tank systems in a low- lying area. Mr. Hurst spoke of the Labor Government's difficulties aris ing from the obstruction to its legislation by the Upper House. This had cost the Government more than $6 million in loss of revenue and had prevented it from proceeding with urgent works. He asked for the peo ple's support for his efforts to get Cabinet agreement to priority for Semaphore Park. The health inspector of the Woodville Council, who was at the meeting, expressed his sup- port for the residents and said that the present situation was a definite menace to health. Councillor Tremethick, from the Croydon ward, said that the Council had done every thing it could to press for the ratepayers' demands, but the Council could not determine the matter as it was one for the State Government. He said that in the four years of Cr. Mitchell's term of office the matter had been raised on many occasions and no one could have done more for the ratepayers in this re gard than what Cr. Mitchell had done. The meeting decided to form a deputation to wait on the Minister and to launch a peti tion campaign in support f their demand. A committee of about 20 ratepayers was formed to work with Cr. Mitchell . to organise the campaign and to launch a publicity drive.
