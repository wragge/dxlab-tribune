 Sickener of the week KAOST sickening event of last week was the adoption, without dissenting vote, of the New South Wales Parliamentary salary rises and' other perks. There is no surprise that the Tjiheral and Country Partv mem- bers favored this, since they be long, in one way or another, to the owning and profit-making class of this capitalist society. What has deepened the re sentment and anger among wage and salary earners, struggling to cope with price inflation, is the acceptance of the rises in both houses by ALp Members. Forgotten was the demand ear lier adopted by the NSW Labor Council that the Government should, in justice, back the unions' wage and margins claims and grant equivalent public service . entitlements. . The Labor MPs' attitude con- ' trasts profoundly with that taken the Communist Fred Paterson who, when a Member in Queens land's State Parliament after World War II, not only gave up his legal practice but publicly donated a parliamentary salary rise to the trade union movement's wage campaign funds. Last week's display showed how parliament, which can be made an arena for real struggle for democratic aims, is used for pur poses of personal opportunism in line with the general profit motive of the existing social sys tem.
