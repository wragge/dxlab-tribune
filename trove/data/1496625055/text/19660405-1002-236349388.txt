 More Tribune BBBBHOBBBBIBBBBHIBBBBBBBBSBBm JpLEASE accept my greet ings and sincere con gratulations on your splen did weekly. I enjoy reading "Tribune" for many reasons, as it is both informative and enter taining. The most wonderful thing about "Tribune" is its note of hope which underlines every single article a.nd which encourages and inspires me, las it surely must, whoever reads this excellent news paper. I am keen on East-West relations, and in friendship and peace. I believe that today, when mankind penetrates deeper and deeper into outer space by fast and all-round tech nical progress, the further retaining of various admin istrative and other barriers for travel from one country to the other represents an evident obstacle to peace, to better knowledge and under standing among people. People shall know one an other better and co-operate in the common cause of peace, without which they can be no real human happiness. â€” Igor Mikhailusenko, In spector for the USSR "Intourist" Agency for Foreiern Travel, Moscow.
