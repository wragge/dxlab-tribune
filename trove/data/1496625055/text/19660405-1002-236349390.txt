 Vietnam March 19 I sent the following letter to both the "Sydney Morning Her ald" and the "Australian," but neither used it. It was not used. I would say, be cause it conflicts too great ly with the Australian Gov ernment's line, incorrect as that line is, and fraught with the gravest consequences for Australia. This was the letter: "The Vietcong rebellion is pictured by Mr. Holt, Mr. Hasluck, Mr. Dean Rusk and other spokesmen as part of China's drive to the south. "No Chinese soldier has ever been seen in South Viet nam, so, if the Vietcong are really fighting and dying for the Chinese, they are evident ly prepared to make a ter rible sacrifice for a foreign power. Would Australians be prepared to do the same? "Another question on Viet nam. It is claimed that, if Australians do not fight the Vietcong.in their own country, they will soon be fighting them in Queensland. "Could it please be explain ed to me, in view of the fact that the Vietcong have absol utely no ships or planes, and the Chinese very few of either, what means of transport it is thought the Vietcong soldiers would use to get to Aus- Australia?"
