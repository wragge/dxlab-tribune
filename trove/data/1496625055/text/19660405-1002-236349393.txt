 Many pensioners, too, were broken by war Letters to the , 1 1IBIK Editor 4 ' ' i, ' -t i, ' " ' _ « 1 i , 'A I HILE fully supporting your opposition to the Government's policy of sending young men into the wicked Vietnam war, I think people should be reminded that many of today's old age pensioners were, in THEIR young days, thrown into a dirty, bloody war that left many of them sick and broken. Many of them got nothing for it and now the survivors are strug gling on&lt; a lousy $12 a week while New South Wales politicians are cutting thick slices of rich pie for themselves and are not even giving crumbs to the old age pensioners. Hitler exterminated five million people quickly. The poor old people in Australia are" allowed1 to die slowly from semi-starvation. If they buy enough food, there isn't enough left to pay the land lord — and vice versa. The un ons are asking $4.3 C( extra for the workers' basic wage (a: I heard cn the Voice of the Countryside radio broadcast) and $2.30 of this is due to the rise in cost of liv'ng since 1964 according to the official figures. How then do people expect the old agers, especially single ones, to live on $12 a week? They are an army marching to the end of their journey — why should they net have a b't of comfort and at least a chance to die decently and not in dirt and neglect; as many do now? x Since my husband's sudden death in 1950 I have been struggling along w.'thout the slightest help from anyone and I wouldn't ask for help personally. My husband be longed to the Returned .Servicemen's League, the Buffs and a: unicn and when he died not one of them asked me if T needed help. Something should be done for the pan-ioners at the same time as we oppose sending Australian youth to blocdy, dirty war to beat down long-suffering; A/=ian people who only want to raise and educate their children and lead a decent lif-p v (Mrs.) A.
