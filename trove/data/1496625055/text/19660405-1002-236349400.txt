 Storm over robber's tale NGRY protests have been made against a front page story in the Sunday Telegraph (March 27) by a self-confessed thief who said "everybody robs clubs". Letters of protest have been . sent in by the Club Managers' Association, the Registered Clubs Association of NSW and the Liquor Trades Union. According to the story, the thief, who said he hud stolen $24,000 as a poker machine mech- ... anic, also accused "committee men, stewards, cleaners and mem bers!' of stealing from clubs. The Liquor Trades Union, whose protest letter has not as yet been printed by the newspaper, has taken the matter up with the NSW Labor Council. The Council last week decided to discuss the matter with unions, including the Journalists' Asso ciation, with a view to taking industrial action. Already members and employees . : at one club have placed a boycott. on the , newspaper. The Liquor Trades Union letter said the paper had sunk to a very low ethical level in basing a banner-line story on the declara tions of a self-confessed thief. "A further aggravation of this contemptible action is the fact that you or persons responsible to you have allowed this equally con temptible individual to use your journal as the medium through which he attacks the integrity and character of thousands of liquor trades members," the letter to the editor said.
