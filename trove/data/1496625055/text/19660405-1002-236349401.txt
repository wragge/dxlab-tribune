 I WIake this Uahuge ' protest I V, 1 gYDNEY: "The Sydney May Day Committee invites the churches and all other organisations jthat have op posed conscription and the war in Vietnam to take Dart in the May Day march", the secretary of the Committee, Mr. J. Tarlington, said yes terday. "Let us make May Day, 1966, a major landmark in the growing popular struggle to end the policy of conscrip tion and war in Vietnam and the Holt Government itself," he said. Mr. Tarlington, Building Workers' Industrial organiser, said that opposition to con scription for the Vietnam war was closely tied to the grow ing economic burdens on the people, the wage demands of the workers and improved living standards generally. This May Day was the 75th. Anniversary of May Day in Australia. This year there will be a replica of the original float that was u-e-d in the first May Day procession in Bar- caldine, Queensland.
