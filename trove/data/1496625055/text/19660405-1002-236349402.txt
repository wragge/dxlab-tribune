 Behind the Kooyong swing gOTH the Labor and Lib eral parties turned the Kooyong by-election into a test of the Government policy of military intervention in Vietnam and conscription. Kooyong, held for 31 years by Menzies, is one of the safest blue ribbon Liberal seats in the coun try. Therefore last Saturday's 7i% swing, related to a general election, would probably mean the defeat of the Government. Over the past 10 years the Labor Party candidate in Koo yong has registered between 22% and 26% of the vote. At a time of economic recession in 1961, when the Government only scraped back by a whisker, the ALP secured 26%. Last Saturday the ALP candi date increased his vote over 1961 and secured a 3.4% increase over the 1963 figure. A section of Liberal voters, not prepared to vote for the ALP candidate, registered their protest by voting DLP, increasing that party's vote by 3.1% over 1963, while another 3500 registered a silent protest by refusing to vote at all. Labor Leader Calwell, in com menting, said: "When the general election occurs later this year, after selected conscripts have be- Jj gun to be killed in this cruel, dirty, unwinnable war, there will be a much greater swing our way."
