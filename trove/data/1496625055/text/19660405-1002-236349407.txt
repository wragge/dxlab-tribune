 Festival money shortage By our Adelaide Correspondent ADELAIDE : One of the results of the Festival of Arts has been a great er awareness that more Government financial assistance is necessary for the Festival's develop ment. Prominent cultural workers have called for better halls, including a festival hall. Resident conductor of the SA Symphony Orchestra, Mr. Henry Krips, said: "1 h/ope some way can be found to bring off the festival hall be cause it is a very sincere need of art in SA to have one com mensurate to the importance of our artistic scene." Of course, the question of halls is not the only need. Assistance is needed to fin ance other aspects of Festival development. For example, Government subsidies would reduce prices. During the Festival the ques tion of Government money as sistance to art generally was brought out. Administration of the Elizabethan Theatre Trust (Mr. Bruce Scott) for example called for more subsidies by State and Federal Govern ments for the Trust. The Arts Festival Confer ence of Professional Repertory Theatres unanimously resolved to call upon the Federal Gov ernment to set up a national organisation to foster the arts throughout Australia. This body would advise the Government on the distribution of funds voted upon, devise and super vise the execution of plans for the encouragement of the arts and report to the Government on new and needed develop ment.
