 A cottage — and miles of nothing gYDNEY: After waiting maybe several years for a home, the families who are expected to move in to the first completed Housing Commission cottages at Mount Druitt this week are in for a shock. These cottages are part of a satellite city scheme that will eventually cover about 2009 acres some 30 miles from Sydney. Like its completed sister city at Green Valley, the -Mt Druitt settlement: is situated, miles frcm any industries or job opportunities for the res idents. The big problem facing the f'rst arrivals at Mt. Druitt will also be isolation from facilities. Their "l'ttle township" of 210 houses within this eventual city is placed smack in the middle of the 20 GO acre paddock. There are no shops, or schools, or churches or pubs within cooee. By road, the nearest shcp is as close as the Mt. Druitt Railway Station — about 21 miles., s . / The existing - Mt. ' Druitt public school, although . hardly big enough for the growing local needs, will also have to accomodate these newcomers. And they will have to travel about two miles to get to it. At present about half of the 210 cottages are completed It is expected that it will be months at least before the others are ready for occupat ion. According to building union spokesmen, the reason 210 houses are built is to comply with the number required for a bus service licence. Does this mean the first arrivals are alec to be stranded without a bus service? Mr. R. Monaghan (the Building Workers Industrial ! Union's organiser, n;fqi: ,,,the area) said the authorities should immediately look into these matters to prevent added hardships for the people con cerned. The project as it stands reveals that the kind of co ordinated community planning which has been so highly re- velbped in socialist countries is completely lacking here.'
