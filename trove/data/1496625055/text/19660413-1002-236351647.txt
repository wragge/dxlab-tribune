 [?] With Tribune's Industrial Roundsman yHE arrival in Aus tralia last weekend of the South African multi-millionaire Oppen- heimer again spotlights the shocking plunder of our mineral resources. He is here to look over his company, Anglo - Amer i c a n (Aust.) Ltd., which is searching for gold and other valuable minerals in Australia. The Oppenheimer empire has jbeen built on the savage ex ploitation of cheap South African colored labor. Now he is welcomed by the Australian Government with open arms. What pleases him about Aus tralia is: "You have such a stable government" (pro-em ployer, of course). .He also is aware of being late in the field — that the Ame ricans are well established. It's good to know that the Yanks haven!t all of Australia under option. . But who wants to hear drivel that his wife "just has dia monds like all people have". What Australians want to know is when the sell-out of our minerals is going to stop? ? JpHE builders' laborers at the Sydney opera house stole the show last week when the key segment of ,the roof was being lifted into place. Cameras were ready to film the historic moment as the 10 tons of concrete swung into position 221ft above sea level. At this stage the dogman draped a huge sign: '"Would you do this for $44 a week." It's a fact tha,t while the project is costing a fortune — the workers are doing it on the cheap! ? Now the employers in NSW want the State Govern ment to change the Act to al low payment of wages by cheque as a means of combat ing payroll thefts. Unions have long established their opposition to this form of payment. Plasterers' Union Federal secretary Kevin Miller last week said it would only in crease dishonesty at another level — and the employee be comes responsible for any cheque which bounces. "My experience is that pay ment by cheque is mainly adopted by unscrupulous fly- by-night employers to defraud workers by giving them bounc ing cheques," he said.
