 LABOR COUNCILS REJECT BREAK-AWAY UNION By the Industrial Roundsman Three State Labor Councils have voted against a decision by the Australian Council of Trade Unions' executive to grant affiliation to the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and ' Joiners of Australia. union spokesmen, particu larly in the building industry, regard the ASC and J as a breakaway union and say that the ACTU executive's decision of last February poses a serious threat to trade union unity. Opposition by three Councils now makes the ACTU execu tive's decision, null and void. Federal officials of the Build ing Workers' Industrial Union say the decision to grant affiliation is a. change of exist ing ACTU policy and as such requires the endorsement of a majority of six States. Both the 1952 and 1953 ACTU Congresses declared opposition to. the registration of the ASC and J and that Labor Councils should not grant affiliation to any branch of this breakaway organisation. The three Labor Councils which to date have voted against the executive decision are Mel bourne (by 118 to 89), West Australia (by 44 to 19) and Queensland '(unanimous). To date only the NSW Labor Council (by 114 votes to 83) and the South Australian Labor Council (by 63 to 42) have en dorsed the executive's decision. The Hobart Council is expect ed to discuss the matter on April 28. Building unionists point out that thie ASC and J was estab lished by the discredited Indus trial Groups and came into existence as a breakaway from the Building Workers' Indus trial Union. The new union was formed when the BWIU was deregis- tered by the Court during an industrial dispute in Victoria.
