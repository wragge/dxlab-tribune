 Chemical workers protest A DELAIDE; More than 200 chemical work ers, including women from the canteens, dem- onstrated with placards through Port Adelaide streets last week. This was the highlight of the workers' fight for service pay and their protest strike against the fertiliser compan ies' use of non-union staff labor. Led by union officials, the march was described as the best in the Port for many years. With their demands for ser vice pay of $1 to $4 a week, chemical workers a.re simply asking for a share in wealth accumulated by their employers. The companies â€” Adelaide Chemical, Wallaroo Mt. Lyell, Cresco and Sulphuric Acid- have grown rich as a result of the exploitation of workers, the high prices they charge farmers for superphosphate (recently increased) and Sen' erous handouts by Liberal Governments. Meeting ...i_ . i i etnn- wnen workers neia a work meeting to discuss their claim, the companies used non union staff labor to keep Pro" duction going. A two-day pro test stoppage was extended when the use of non-union labor continued, despite pre vious directions from Concil iation Commissioner Gough to withdraw such labor. The workers remained on strike for 10 days until the companies were forced to with draw the labor and a confer ence between the compare and the unions was arranged before a Conciliator to dis cuss the men's claims. This was scheduled for Tuesday of this week. The companies acted quite hypocritically by claiming tha the use of staff labor was ne cessary because of safety, y they rejected an offer by men to discuss the mainten ance of safety. The latest expression of sup port for the chemical work ers comes from the Gaswork- ers' Union.
