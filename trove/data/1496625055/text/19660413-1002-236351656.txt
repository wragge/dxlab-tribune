 Stronger Left in UK Pari. gONDON: The British people in the general election completely rejected the Tory effort to stage a comeback. Labor has got back with a huge majority, more than enough to enact progressive social and political meas ures. The Political Committee of the British Communist Party said this in a comment on the British General Elections. In conditions of a strong : swing to Labor, and where the first-past-the post sys- tem makes big votes for Communist candidates hard ier to get than in Australia, some CP results were , good, while others were disappoint ing. The Soviet TASS news- agency notes that the elec torate's striving for a pro gressive policy found ex pression in their support for many left wing candidates who came out against the war in Vietnam, against limitation of immigration from Commonwealth count ries, against the attacks on the workers' rights. Left wing Laborites K. Zilliacus, Sidney Silverman, Emrys Hughes and J. Men- delson, among others, were returned by a comfortable majority. The British Communist Party statement says: "The fight .of the | Left is now more important than before. The Left forces will be stronger in Parliament and the Left fight outside Parli ament will grew also. The stronger that fight in the country, the more it will be reflected in Parliament. "A new stage in the Left progressive struggle now opens up: to force action against the monopolies, to defeat the incomes policy and the threatened legislation against the unions, to put social spending before arms, to end Britain's support of the US in Vietnam and the 'east of Suez' policy, and to get an independent British foreign policy.
