 ISN'T IT TIME! Bombs, bombs, and now- where to hide, Machine guns firing in an endless tide. Clouds of bullets whistle by> And here young men die. Cities bombed, houses burnt, Isn't it time that people learnt? Women and children lying on the ground. I hope an answer will soon be found. Sherie Cross, N.S.W. (12 years)
