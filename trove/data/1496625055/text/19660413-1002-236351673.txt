 [?] A tale from the 30's '"JHE DISINHERITED" by Jack Conroy was first published in 1933. It is a story filled with the tragedy of people in America who lived during the great de pression of the thirties. -The author- wrote of his own experiences as the son of an un employed miner. The unemployed — boys, men. girls, women — seeking work travelled far afield — lucky if they could "jump a rattler" tramping the highways and hitch-hiking if possible. Railway detecthe.s ever on the watch for "bagmen" would treat them with brutality unless a careful watch was kept and the workers were able to elude them. One weary worker describes to his wife .his experiences seeking a . job: ''Men everywhere! 'NO tfEfcP ' WANTED' is all you can siee la round the lact ones. Mien on the street corners. Men at I I he factory gates. -They turned he hose on 30,000 of them a I Ford's in Detroit. But life went on. boys met and married girls and managed some how to find a place to live and rear a family. Heroism is portrayed in this book, heroism of those who com bined together to win a better deal for the unemployed; heroism of the women who managed to scrounge enough food to feed . their families. The well-known novelist, John Dos Passos, writes of the book: "The whole thing seemed to me an absolutely solid, unfaked piece of narrative as good as the best of Jack London."
