 NG: Making if clear The letter "Grabbing N.G. ores" (Tribune, Feb. 23), as a result of editorial shorten ing does not convey the meaning that I had intend ed. In paragraph 6 it states "the deposits . . . are in fact high grade" This is something which is known only to the experts of Conzinc-Rio Tinto but judging by the eagerness of the company to get its sticky hands on the deposits it would seem that they are high-grade. The last paragraph is ob viously incorrect as the com pany concerned, Con-Zinc-Rio- Tinto, is on the Melbourne register. My view is that all com panies operating in the Terri tory should be registered THERE and be required to furnish their returns there. We have the invidious and humiliating situation where the Bulolo Gold Mining and Dregding Co., a Canadian concern, issues its reports at Vancouver and any informa tion required by the Adminis tration has to be gleaned from these reports.
