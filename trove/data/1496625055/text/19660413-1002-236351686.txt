 Postal workers discuss plan JYDNEY, Tuesday : Mail officers are meeting throughout Aus tralia today to discuss a proposed plan to settle the dispute over elec tronic letter sorting machines. The Amalgamated Postal Workers' Union is strongly opposed to young girls oper ating these machines at rates of pay much lower than that of a mail officer. The union is demanding that ihe new automatic processes being introduced into the GPO should not be to the detriment of wages and job classification of workers. Already a national 24-hour stoppage of 8000 mail officers has taken place over this dis_ pute. Following the stoppage, mail officers worked to regulations j'.aid, in some cities, had also banned overtime. Last Thursday a conference was held before the Public Ser vice Arbitrator, Mr. E. Chamb ers, at which the Federal offi cials of the APWU agreed that he be allowed to arbitrate on job classification, wages and conditions. Union spokesmen, however, point out that the Public Ser vice Arbitration Act does not a-llow for the arbitrator to deal with matters concerning job classification. This is the prerogative of the Public Service Board. All unions in the PMG's De partment, covering some 100,- 000 workers, have backed the mail officers in this dispute. They say that any blame for disruption of mail services lies at the Federal Government's feet as the unions were not even consulted about the intro duction of the electronic mach ines. Many posta-1 workers are also sceptical about Mr. Chambers arbitrating on an issue beyond his jurisdiction and ' fear it could be a manoeuvre on the part of the Federal Govern ment. For these reasons all postal unions will be closely watch ing the outcome of the hear, ing commencing on April 18. See also page 10.
