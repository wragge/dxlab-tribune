 Good word for youth J AM a World War II ex- serviceman (a volunteer) with five sons, four of whom are liable for call-up against the interests of the Asian people. I wish to commend those Australian youth who so courageously and honorably burnt their draft cards and declared their repugnance and physical and moral re sistance in being used in such a dirty war. This should be a guide to the whole of Australian youth. G. MULHOLLAND, Hamilton (N-S.W.)
