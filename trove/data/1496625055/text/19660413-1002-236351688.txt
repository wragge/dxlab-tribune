 White collar Vietnam protests JELBOURNE: The Federal Executive ot the Austra lian Council of Salaried and Professional Associations last week in Melbourne declared its opposition to the Govern ment's conscription policy and involvement in the Viet nam war.

In Canberra recently, 100 students and sympathisers staged a sit-down demonstra tion in front of Parliament House, following a meeting addressed by Senator Wheeldon (Lab., WA) and Messrs. B. MacFarlane and R. Garnaut. One student was charged with offensive behavior after he had climbed the base of the King George V statue and held up a placard.
