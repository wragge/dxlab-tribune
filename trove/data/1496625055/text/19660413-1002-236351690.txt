 Insurance rises for cars LA®T year, under a Labor Government, I paid the Government Insurance the amount of £24/6/6 for a comprehensive insurance policy, covering my car for £950. This year, with a Liberal Government in office, on re ceiving my account from the Government Insurance I was amazed to find that, while the value of my car had dropped to £800, the premium had been incresed to $80,70. After visiting the Govern ment Insurance office I found that not only had the car value dropped and 20 per cent been added to the account, but, that a concession of approximately £8 to Government employees such as myself had been drop ped. Also a £10 franchise was now in vogue for accidents in curred. The policy seems to be to drive the worker off the road! Railway Worker, Auburn (NSW).
