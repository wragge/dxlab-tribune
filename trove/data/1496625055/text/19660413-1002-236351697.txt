 [?] Supporting the nurses wages struggle DECENT demonstrations u c j by bydney nurses for better living con ditions have brought under notice anomalies which have existed for a long time. Nurses perform uch duties as washing, feeding and ad- l ministernig prescribed medi cines to the patient. The less capable a patient, the more dependent he is on the nurse. Conditions vary slightly from hospital to hospital, however in all cases nurses are the link between, doctor and patient. A shortage of nurses means ; that patients do not get the , care to which they are en- ; titled. , , During my recent stay in ( hospital a third year nurse showed me her pay envelope containing $16 for a fortnight's work, after tax, superannua tion and living expenses had been deducted. ' Nurses are generally requir- ed to attend lectures in their own time. To qualify to become a Sister, nurses have to study very hard for a period of at least four years. They also have to buy books and other material necessary for these studies. The N.S.W.; Nurses' Associ ation deserves the support of the whole trade union move ment in efforts to improve liv ing standards. Leo Martin, Kings Cross (NSW)
