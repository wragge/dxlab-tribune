 More pressure on Smith gRITISH moves against two oil tankers carrying oil to the white racist Smith regime in Rhodesia follow urgent and growing demands both inside and outside Britain, for decisive action against Smith. The Soviet newsagency TASS, reporting this, says that last Wednesday, April 6, members of the special com mittee set up by. the British Commonwealth conference at Lagos in January to review the Rhodesian situation met behind closed doors in Lon don. According to British press reports, the delegates of African member-countries of ihe Commonwealth, showed :hat they were angered by the British failure to stop ships carrying oil to Smith unload- ng oil for him at Mozambique, n Portuguese-ruled Africa- They demanded that Britain either use force to end the il- legal white-settler dictatorship in Rhodesia or transfer the problem to the U.N. British press reports say that the British representative had to admit that economic sanc tions against Smith were not effective. The Africans seem to have stressed that action against the pirate tanker fleet would not be enough and took this stand when Britain did in fact yield to their pressure and take the matter to the U.N. Their case was supported by the London Financial Times which said that action against the ships would have "mainly a psychological effect" as "Rhodesia already has suffi- cient stocks of fuel received from the South African Re public" â€” the Verwoerd re gime. On the Security Council the African delegates moved a series of motions demanding action from Britain (which claims sole authority over Rhodesia) of a nature which would really hurt Smith and help the African majority in Rhodesia. they were supported by the socialist countries' delegates, but were defeated after a bitter struggle. Action by Britain against the tankers was then endorsed by a 10 to nil vote of the Security Council, with the African and Socialist countries abstaining.
