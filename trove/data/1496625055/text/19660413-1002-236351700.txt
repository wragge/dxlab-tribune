 A HARVEST | ON MAYDAY By JUNE MILLS JYDNEY: Once again this week it was necessary to close the books for receipt of donations early, due to the Easter holidays. Next week, we are look ing forward to a "bumper harvest", for May Day is just around the corner. A good way to show appreciation of Tribune's attention to this impor tant working class day, and this year marks the 75th anniversary of May Day, "would be to send a special donation to the Fund. This week Tribune's long-time friend John gave a donation of 10. We are particularly pleased', as we know John reads the paper with a very watchful eye. In the acknowledgements last week was a donation of $10 from Pat, a fairly new supporter of Tribune Fund. While appreciating his donations so far, we hope he will become a regular donor. We express regret to the Canberra Communist Party Branch for omission from March 30th issue of a donation of $1.60 "In memory of Norman Jeff rey." .
