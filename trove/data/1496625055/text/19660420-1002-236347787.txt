 j u n j err t r j 14 E L L O, TRIBUNE ri JUNIORS, Well, it is nearly holiday time again. Did you have an interesting Easter? How many of the Sydney readers went to the Royal Easter Show? Did you enjoy it and what did you like best, and what did the readers in the other States do over their holidays? How about dropping me a letter telling me. all about it? I do hope that in the May holidays you will have time to get busy with your pens and brushes so that I will be able to look forward to some more letters; my mail-bag has been empty lately. — Dinewan. PICTURES FROM PAPER Here is an idea for that special gift for Mother's Day or that birthday that is coming along. It is not a new idea, the Chinese people have been doing it for ages. It is paper-cuts. Your pictures can be framed or mounted on a gift card. The drawings may be simple, or as you get better, involved. This, is how to do it: 1. Take . a piece of white paper, draw any design you like with a pencil. 2. Make the lines quite thick and be sure that they are con nected so that the figures won't fall apart when cut. In the design shown, for example, the lines of the eyes are connected to the lines of the face, although in an ordinary drawing this would not have been necessary. 3. Pin the white piece of paper to a colored piece of paper. 4. Use scissors to cut out the useless spaces around the out line of your design. COIN CORNER Saw two very interesting coins the other day. One was a 1794 brass coin, a Coventry halfpenny. On the back of it was Lady Godiva on a horse. The other coin was very small, and I am not sure what you could have bought with it. It was an English coin and was marked one-third of a farthing. Remember last , week we said we would have a look at how coins are valued? There are three main points that dealers and collectors look for: 1. Condition of coin and its preservation. 2. The scarcity of a certain coin. 3. The demand for a coin at any given time. There are seven classes or sections into which the condi tion of the coins fall into— extremely fine, very fine, fine, very good, good, fair and poor. Next week more detail about the seven sections.
