All unions were called on the hold factory and job meetings as "the most effec tive way of answering the Federal Government's pro vocative march on April 21." Labor Councilor said it deplored the recent attempts by newspaper articles and I Government statements to inflame public opinion against those who are op posed to the Government's conscription policies and participation in the Vietnam war. "We consider the. Federal Government's decision to conduct a march of troops, including conscript trainees, through Sydney on April 21 to be a deliberate attempt to incite action against any possible anti-Government de monstrations on this day." Council said "the trade union movement does not direct its opposition against the young men in our Armed Forces, but against the Gov ernment policy which com mits them to the unjust and cruel war in Vietnam."
