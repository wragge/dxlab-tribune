 Pensioners JpENSIONERS, in addition to having to live on the miserable pittance they re ceive from the Government each week, suffer other in dignities, which certainly make their lot harder. For example, I recently saw my doctor who ordered me to have an X-ray at a hospital. "Ring and make an appoint ment," he said. When I rang the hospital I was asked if I was a pen sioner. On replying in the af firmative I was told to write for an appointment. . This I did some consider able time ago and have receiv ed no reply from the hospital. A pensioner friend in an other part of Sydney has had a similar experience and has had to wait, for many weeks for the appointment. Elderly people, more prone to ailments than when they were young, need sympathetic and quick treatment. They should not be made to feel (as many do) that hospitals don't care what happens to them, that they are a nuisance and can only be "fitted in" after very long delays. Entitled to free medical care, which should be of real assistance in ekeing out their pension, this should be freely available without long delays. After all both doctors and hos pitals are paid for their treat ment of pensioners. M. A., Sydney (NSW).
