 Dylan and Yevtushenko YX7HAT a month for cul- ture! One week, Yevtushenko, the next, Bob Dylan. The two make an exciting contrast. Do they represent two cultures, or just different age-groups? If they do repres ent modern Soviet and modern Capitalist culture this is very revealing of the two systems. Essentially they both ex press revolt: Yevtushenko, critical, constructive and es- sentially loyal, to humanity as a whole and his own country. Dylan, critical, destructive, giv ing the impressipn that he dis likes and distrusts most of humanity and is alienated from his own country. Dylan's crypto a reporter "I never wanted to be an odd ball!" is most revealing. Here is. a poet in spite of himself, a. would-be conformist unable to shut out the bitter reality of life around him. In the first part of. his pro gramme at the Sydney Sta dium he seemed a forlorn and joyless figure, alone on the stage and hating his loneli ness. He perked up in the second half when singing with his "folk-rock" group. The last piece of all even had a trium phant sound, quite different from the sad and rather hope less note of the first half. It was a pity the words were inaudible for the most part;. Dylan's poetry is most inter esting. It may be that Dylan will end up by "conforming" as so many have before him. If he does he will inevitably fade cut, but nothing can take away the bitter and stirring effect of his early songs which ex pressed so well the disillusion ment and despair of the youth of today with the "Affluent Society".
