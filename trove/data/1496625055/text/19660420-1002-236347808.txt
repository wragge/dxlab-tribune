 Poison j pen letters T WAS looking through some old newspapers, « when I came across the fol lowing article in the Sunday j 5 Telegraph of June 6, 1965: "The First Battalion Royal Australian Regiment has ;J| clamped stringent regulations on its .troops to protect morale I and. wives and families from \ Communist poison pen let- ters." Ill "The Communists cannot be j||| underrated" the article goes jj&j on to say. "They will use any |J|| tactics". |fl The attitude' of the Tele- |||| graph, the most verbal spokes- Zm man for the millionaire class, ;|| ' towards, working class parties ||| is well known. However, we ;|1 can give the Telegraph some J|| credit, for its attitude towards "poison-pen" letters to our m boys in Vietnam, but we do j|| not consider that the Tele- g| graph is in any position to ||| draw conclusions as to the jVvj source of these letters. , '4 We who support the Com- ' # munist Party and its cause are || well aware of the integrity of ||| its members, and although we consider the millionaire press t||| is entitled to its opinion, we gy|| have a right to act when » k|| resorts to deliberate lies to |b| discredit the Labour Move- |Mj ment. flffl There are still hundreds of j||| people whose minds have been poisoned by anti-com- \---m munist propaganda. These peo- M pie per media of the daily press have dubbed us "trouble makers". For the achievement ||| of a policy of friendship an® ||| goodwill towards our Asian g neighbours, the pegging 01 ||Jj prices and the raising of hv ||| ing standards, let us just jfP ® right on "making trouble l|| shall we?
