 Wages cheque pROPOSED payment of employees by cheque rather by cash is a challenge to the worker to take away one of his rights — how he should be paid. The B.H.P., have been con ducting a survey at their New castle steel works on this mat ter. According to an article in the Newcastle Morning Herald the reason for the proposal is that it would save some . of their employees the inconveni ence of haying to come to the works to collect their wages on the days they are rostered off. It was also stated by the BHP spokesman that this would mean a great cut in the Accountancy Section of their pay office as there are 11,000 men employed at their New castle works. Thus the BHP would save money and the workers would suffer — mainly, the pay clerks who now count the moiiey that goes into the pay envelopes and hand the pay out. - Imagine the savings of other big monopolies such as ACI, CSR, Holdens, if they also decide to accept this idea. Most banks close at 3 o'clock and are not open on Saturday morning, so if your money goes into a savings account it means loss of time at work to collect the wages due to you, or inconvenience- to the house wife if she has to go. to the bank to collect the money. No matter which angle this question of payment by cheque is looked at, it means the worker would lose. This is a matter than work ers and unions should not ienore. On Guard, Sydney (NSW).
