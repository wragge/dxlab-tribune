 ; YEARS g'0F: iHAY IPAY: i -Jbje &lt;» u \ SYDNEY: This year's May Day March in Syd« ney on Sunday, May 1 gives trade unionists and other progressive people a further opportunity to protest against high prices, low wages and the sending of young Australian conscripts to : Vietnam. S Mr. J. Tarlington, the May I Day Committee secretary, ! said this in calling for a I bumper roll up of march ers. This year a special invitation has been made to churches and youth organisations to participate. y The Youth Campaign Against Conscription organisation has already sought permission to march and are to be given an f honored position toward the head of the procession. It j,s anticipated that there will be a replica of the original float that was used in the first | May Day procession in Barcal- \ dine, Queensland. This is to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the first recorded May Day in Australia. On that historic occasion 1340 shearers, 700 of whom were mounted, demonstrated through the town during the period of the big strike. A May Day Dinner is being held tonight (Wednesday) at the Sydney Trade Union Club at which an historic tableau is be- L ing performed by New Theatre. 1 On Tuesday, April 26 at the I Sydney Trades Hall the assist- | ant secretary of the N.S.W. I Labor Council, Mr. R. Marsh, I will propose the traditional I "Toast to May Day" at a trade | union celebration. 1 The Deputy Lord Mayor of | Sydney will receive the 10 May 1 Queen candidates at the ball in I the Sydney Town Hall on | April 29. | The successful candidate will also be announced at that func tion.
