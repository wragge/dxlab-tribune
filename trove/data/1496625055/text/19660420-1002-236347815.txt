 COORDINATED 1 The incidents are part of a whole series indicating coordinated stepping up of an anti-China campaign by the USA and its subordinates. Thus South Vietnam's Marshal Ky, now branded by virtually the whole of South Vietnam as a US puppet, came out a week ago with a demand for the US to "bomb China". The new Indonesian militarist regime has un- . ' leashed a series of provocative acts against Chinese nationals and the Chinese Government which may mean a straight-out rupture of relations. Dutifully chiming in, Australian External Affairs Minister Hasluck, in Washington, appealed to European nations to take up an actively anti-Chin ese position. US spokesmen Rusk and Goldberg, while feeling it necessary to throw in some soothing phrases for the benefit of those who are demanding friendship with China, have both in the past week re-stated the US cold war position â€” that the world's biggest power must be outlawed because (unlike any of the 114 UN member nations) it is "aggressive". All this has given added zest to Australia's pro fessional hate-China brigade, the DLP and the Liberal Rightwingers. For years they have been frenziedly trying to cut off even the limited contacts Australia has with China through trade. In this connection it must be said that the attitude of the Labor Party leadership leaves much to be desired.
