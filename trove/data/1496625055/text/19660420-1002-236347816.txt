 WEST UNIONS MOVING FOR PRICES CLAMP PERTH: The West Australian Trades and Labor Council last I week called for unions to develop a campaign to force the State Liberal Government to introduce price control," in accord ance with the policy of the Australian Council of Trade Unions The council stated that un ions had a prime responsibil ity to develop job activity in the campaign. The Council was endorsing a request from the Miscellaneous Workers' Union for action on the prices issue. Another M.W.U. proposal, for a pamphlet on rising prices, was endorsed. Further resolu tions on price rises from the Carpenters' Union reflected workers' growing dissatisfac tion with price racketeering. Higher bread prices have helped along the profit of George Weston Ltd., the huge British monopoly which now controls Perth's bread and much of the meat supply. (Weston's consolidated net pro fit for 1965 rose by a further $266,100 or 10.3% to $2,847,100). Weston Foods now owns the following W.A. subsidiaries: W. Thomas and Co., Joyce Bros. (W.A.) Ltd., Watson's Food Holdings, Anchorage Butchers and bakeries and milling com panies. Swan Brewery's increased dividend rate for the year end ed March 31 (13%) will be help ed along further by the higher price for middies under deci mal currency in its many "tied" hotels. A one in four bonus share issue had earlier helped tq soak up some of its excess profit. >
