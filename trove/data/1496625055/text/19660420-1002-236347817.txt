 Anti-China Provocations "THE American bombing of the Hanoi suburbs on Sunday represents a new and provocative escalation of the Vietnam war, and a calculated provocation against China. Hanoi is not far from the Chinese frontier, where the rajilway linking China with North Vietnam has already been attacked. (Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi was recently reported by a visiting Philippines senator as having told her that China would send troops into North Vietnam if Hanoi or Haiphong were attacked). It was only a week earlier that a US military plane was shot down over China after "losing its way" in the manner well known to students of US brinkmanship. These incidents indicate that the US has decided to intensify its aggressive pressure against China, perhaps in an effort to cover up its increasing em barrassment in Vietnam.
