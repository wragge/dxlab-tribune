Not even the US State Department claims that . there is one Chinese soldier in Vietnam or any other foreign country. On the contrary, continued US occupation of the Chinese islands of Taiwan (Formosa), Quemoy and , Matsu shows who is really doing the "thrusting". The new wave of anti-Chinese incitement con tains a grave threat to the whole south east Asian area and means ultimately especially grave danger to Australia, whose basic interests require an under standing and good all round relations with China. This was recognised before and during the last war by all authorities on Australian policy.. It is an objective fact not altered by the post-war change in China's social order.
