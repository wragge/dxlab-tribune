Under the award, most com panies deduct payments due for annual leave when a worker stops work in defence of wages and conditions . In defence of their leave rights mass meetings of meqt workers, last Monday resolved to keep to .an earlier decision not to work at Stuart and Ross River meatworks (Townsville) and Merinda Meatworks (Bowen). Meat companies are expected to press for action on sum monses issued against the union. These could make the union liable to $20,000 in penalties ,in addition to the $4000 with costs already imposed. . The Queensland Trades and Labor Council has inserted an advertisement in the "Austra lian" warning workers to pro tect their leave rights. It says that the Meat Union in Queensland has sought con ferences with the employers to negotiate protection of leave rights, but the employers pre fer to use Commonwealth Court penal apparatus to brow beat workers into accepting loss of annual leave. It says that the Meat Union still wants a conference to settle the dispute because penal provisions will not bring industrial harmony. The Trades and Labor Coun cil on behalf of the AMIEU asks all workers to support the principle that annual leave ' is an inviolate right and that workers ana unions defending annual leave must not be sub ject to heavy fines in the Com monwealth Court.
