 ragr « i First response to May Day By JUNE MILLS SYDNEY: First resoonse to our appeal I for a special May Day donation was from our long-time friend L.R. whose expressions of support for Tribune have been referred to many times in this column. A donation of $2 from J.K., Belmore, was accom panied by a cheerful note: "Just another hello, how are . you and wishing you every success in carrying out that good potted philo sophy 'pegging away'. "In affairs of today two groups loom largely — one pursuing the policy of massing money and. using power for private gain, and the other a rapidly growing group seeking to use all our resources for public good. ...
