 Building unions plan to merge C YDNEY : Two big nation-al unions last week de lined to Work out plans to amalgamate. This was decided at a meet ing between the federal exec- utives of the Building Workers Industrial Union (45,000 mem bers) and the Operative, Painters and Decorators Union (25,000 members)'. Amalgamation of these two unions would make the new union- the biggest in the build ing industry. A statement issued following the meeting said there was complete agreement that the amalgamation between two or more building unions should, whenever practicable, be effec ted as steps towards the objec tive of one union for the building industry. Federal conferences of both unions had earlier declared in favor of amalgamation; Last week's conference dec ided to conduct a- combined campaign amongst the member ships. Following a period of explanation the views of mem bers will be sought through a ballot. A joint national committee is to work out proposals to effect amalgamation. The Federal secretary and president of the Operative Plasterers Federation also attended the talks as observers. That union's federal confer ence had also carried a resol ution supporting amalgamation. The meeting expressed the hope that other unions inter ested will agree to take part in the moves towards the formation of one union in the industry. A booklet recently published by the BWIU said there are 21 unions in the building in dustry which between them occupy about -60 different sets of office premises. They have collectively a total of 140 full time officials, own about 100 motor cars and quite often officials cover the same ground. The BWIU say that this duplication of equipment and effort is costly.
