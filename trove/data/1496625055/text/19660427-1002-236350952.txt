 More agony for Viet. LONDON: If the Ky regime survives and the war goes on it will become "infinitely more beastly" in the coming months, says New Statesman editor Paul Johnson. He says the US Chemical and Engineering News re ports vastly Increased pro curement plans by the US air force for napalm. Last month the United Tech nology Centre in California got a contract for 100 million lbs of an "improved" napalm jelly which contains 50 per cent polystyrene. The magazine adds: "This is the Air Force's third procure ment in the secrecy-shrouded program in the past 18 months. "Prediction of future use of polystyrene in Napalm-B are now running as high as 25 million lbs per month." The new jelly, says John son, what the US pilots refer to as incendigel, is replacing the old soap-jelled gasoline napalm as used in Korea. According to Chemical News, "US combat forces in Vietnam are finding that the older formulations leave much to be desired, particularly in adhesion."
