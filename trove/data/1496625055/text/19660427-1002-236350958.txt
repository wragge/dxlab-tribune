 India says: USA , , should leave Vietnam MEW DELHI: Indian diplomats in Wash ington are embarrassed by US press reports that the annual report of India's External Affairs ministry has called for US forces to leave Vietnam. This is reported by the Times of India's correspond ent in New York and quoted by the Indian Communist Party paper New Age. New Age says the US admin istration is pressing the In dian Government to withdraw or repudiate the report. But in New Delhi the Ex ternal Affairs ministry's spokesman said the statement in the report fully accorded with statements by former Premier Shastri and by for eign minister Swaran Singh. The report complained of said the Government was con vinced that a lasting Vietnam settlement could only come through peaceful methods and "warlike acts and foreign in tervention should cease." The report then states the main points of India's policy which has angered Washing ton. These are that there cannot be "a military solution; a pol- ileal solution must be found through a Geneva-type confer ence; fighting should stop in Vietnam and US forces should leave; the aim must be a un ited Vietnam free of military alliances and foreign troops. The Americans are particul arly annoyed because it ap peared during Mrs. Gandhi's Washington visit that hungry India was vulnerable to US pressure on the Vietnam issue.
