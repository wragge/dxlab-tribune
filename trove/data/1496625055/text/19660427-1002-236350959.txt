United States Defence Secretary McNamara left no doubt that menacing escala tion was on the agenda when he boasted to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that Americans dropped 50,000 tons of wnbs on Vietnam . . in nn« ' aBainst a rate of 48,000 tons a month in jurope and Africa during Wortd War II and 17,500 lns monthly in Korea. tnAtTrIcan Planes» according w McNamara's gold-blooded bragging, plan to drop 638,000 tons of bombs on North and South Vietnam during this year equal to 40 per cent of the total of bombs used in the European theatre during the second world war. The South Vietnam crisis has placed more emphasis on bases in Thailand, Okinawa, Guam, the Philippines and the 7th fleet carriers, be cause the Americans cannot guarantee their position in Danang, Hue and even in . Saigon suburbs. . In the first three months of this year another 12,600 puppet soldiers defected ac cording to the Vietnamese newsagency. The American magazine "New Republic" asks: "If the South Vietnamese soldiers, policemen, civil em ployees, monks, students, school children, all of them, proclaim anti-American slo gans why should we really stay there and doom to death a still greater number of young . Americans?"
