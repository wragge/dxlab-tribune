 Lawson on record J JYDNEY: AH keen I I fans of Henry f I Lawson can now hear | some of his best | poems on long-play ing record. Clarrie Reilly, well known on the Sydney and Newcastle waterfronts, has , made the LP record "Faces in the Street" named after Lawson's poem. "Texas Jack", "Freedom Ion the Wallaby", "Waratah and the Wattle" and "The Men Who Made Australia" are included in the selec- | tion of Lawson's work. 1 Banjo Patterson's "Bush Christening" and C. J. Dennis' Romeo and Juliet from the "Sentimental Bloke" are also included. A pleasant addition to the record is provided by Newcastle's Lorna Cooper, joined by the "Nomads Three" who present Aus tralian songs which include "Click go the Shears", "Reedy River" and the original Queensland ver sion of "Waltzing Matilda." The recording of Law- son's poems is a commend able new development in the struggle to preserve and foster Australian cul ture. However the record, as with many others, suffers from having a tape record er as an audience. Retailing at $4.50, it is an inexpensive buy for Law- son lovers. I Our copy was obtained from Mrs. Barbara Curth- oys, 368 Hunter Street ' Newcastle. &lt; It is also on sale at the &lt; Sydney branch of the Waterside Workers Feder- : ation, 60 Sussex Street, Sydney. Clarrie Reilly. has re quested that all proceeds from the. sale of the record j be held in a special fund , by the Newcastle branch of the Realist Writers to be , used to encourage further reptording of Australian poetry. His own services ' in helping to make "Faces in the Street" were purely I 1 voluntary. I I
