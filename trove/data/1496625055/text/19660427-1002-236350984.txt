 Postscript on Ireland "TO points made in the Tribune's excellent series on the Irish Easter Rebellion I would add just one or two more: Over centuries the Eng lish . rulers conquered Ire land not once but many times, slaughtered the popula tion wholesale and did every thing the U.S. is now doing or trying to do to Vietnam. But, in the end, Ireland won. e Victorious in the war with Germany, Britain had a greater military superiority over Ireland in 1918-21 than the U.S. has over Vietnam to day. But Britain could not win and had to sign a treaty with those the Government had de nounced for years as the U.S. now denounces the "Viet Cong", Though Britain managed to keep a piece of Ireland which she retains today, she paid a price for it which could easily have ruined or destroyed her for ever. In 1940, when Britain faced her worst peril in 1000 years, Ireland stayed neutral and: denied Britain facilities which might have proved essential to ; defeat the threatened Hitlerite invasion. (A contrast: the Soviet re volutionary Government once, in 1917, granted full dependence to all the former; subjects nations — white 'and; colored — of the Czar. In 1941-42, when the USSR's position was desperate, the free non-Russian Soviet rep ublics rallied closely to Russia to defeat the common eh" emy). W.W., , Mosman (N.S.W. )
