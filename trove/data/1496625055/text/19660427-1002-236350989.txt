 Tribute to E. Ross How can we appraise the value of a class-con scious journalist? One who regardless of self, fear lessly with sincerity and great ability seeks out the truth and publishes it in support of the working people. The journalist whom capit alism cannot buy over with its money or its honors! His value is beyond price! I place Edgar Ross in this category and take , the oppor tunity on his retirement from the Editorship of Common Cause to pay this tribute. Throughout the long years Edgar has unselfishly and con sistently given of his best to the Australian miners, the working people of this coun try and indeed to the working people of all lands. Together with such - men as as Wilfred Burchett and Rupert Lockwood, Edgar Ross is among the salt of the earth who occupy a particular place in Australian journalism. Edgar has retired from the Miners' paper but I know we will continue to gain much from his able writing in, other fields. Such men work for the use ful people of the earth until the last. R.
