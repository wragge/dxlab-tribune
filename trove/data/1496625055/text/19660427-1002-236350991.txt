 Clerks topple pro- war motion QYDNEY: The general meet- ing of the NSW Branch of the Federated Clerks Union last week in Sydney rescinded a resolution on Vietnam sponsor ed by the union leadership and jzi ned at an earlier meeting. Clerks say that the original resolution was pushed through the March meeting without any discussion after an address by the federal secretary (Mr. Rior- dan) on his recent visit to Sai gon. Speakers pointed out that the officials' resolution had called for "vigorous" prosecution of the Vietnam war, although the Australian Council of Trade Unions, its state branches, and the Australian Council of Sal aried and Professional Associa tions opposed Australian in volvement in the war and jought a peaceful solution. The main speakers against the rescission motion were Messrs. Riordan, OToole (NSW secretary) and Macken. Follow- , ing an hour's debate the res cission was carried by 66 votes to 57,
