 QLD meat men defend right to annual leave BRISBANE: The dispute in the meat industry, cur- rently holding up production in certain North Queensland meatworks, is due to the failure of meat companies tc recognise under Federal awards that the worker has a basic right to annual leave. This was stated this week jointly by the Queensland Trades and Labor. Council President (Mr. J. Egerton) and Secretary (Mr. A. Mac- donald). "The meat issue is funda mentally industrial," the state ment said. "The Trades and Labor Council in Queensland does not countenance any interference with annual leave of the work er and his family and fully supports the meat industry union in their demand for an nual leave rights not subject to challenge, penalty, pr any action savouring of conscrip tion by the employers. "Sacrosanct" "Under state law, annual leave is sacrosanct, but Feder ally it can be interfered with by the employers. "Any dispute in the meat industry is due to the failure of the meat companies to recognise that annual leave, which is a right in State Awards must also be a right Federally. "Failure of meat companies to agree to sit around a table to discuss normal collective trade union views on safe guarding of annual leave only continues the dispute. "The union and the Trades and Labor Council have been and are willing to work for talks around the issue of annual leave in order to get a solution to the problem that is cur rently holding up production of certain North Queensland meatworks. "Their desire for a confer ence of the parties now to re solve the issue has been made known to the Australian Coun cil of Trade Unions in a tele gram signed by twenty-seven Queensland State unions. "The Trades and Labor Coun cil will assist the unions to have this dispute resolved satis factorily, at least on the basis of protecting annual leave as a right." liiiiiiliiiiiiiiiiii:!iiiiiiiii:iiiiiiiiiiiiii!M:i:iiii!iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiniiiiiiiiiiiiiin
