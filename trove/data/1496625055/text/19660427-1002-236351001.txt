 Gold miners may stop K A L GOORLIE (WA). A 24-hour stoppage by 2,000 AWU mining div ision members seems likely to take place on Monday, May 2. About 250 men who attended a meeting in Boulder Town Hall on Sunday (April 17) decided to call the stoppage unless the Chamber of Mines agreed by May 1 to extend to the A.W.U. members the $1 per shift productivity bonus grant ed three months ago to trades men on the mines. Meantime the union is con tinuing the strict work-to- regulation campaign begun on March 25. Gold mining regulations limit the time underground to a 71 hour day, 371 hour week and prohibit most Saturday work. Mining division secretary F. Lithgow. said the strike would involve nearly all mem bers in Kalgoorlie, Norseman, Mt. Ida and Mt. Magnet, ex cept for five or six men on essential work in each mine. A mass meeting of members would be held on the day of the stoppage. The strike decision arises from a dispute between the AWU and Chamber of Mines begun in December last year when fitters and boilermakers were granted the productivity bonus. In February, this was ex tended to electricians, but still denied to the miners.
