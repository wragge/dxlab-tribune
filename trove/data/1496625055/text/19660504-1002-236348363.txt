 Call to act on | housing JYDNEY: The federal secretary of the Building Workers In dustrial Union, Mr. F. Purse, last week called for a campaign to demand a greater Gov ernment home building program. Mr. Purse said that while growing unemployment was developing within the building industry there was still about 80,000 applicants for Govern ment housing throughout Aus tralia. i The Australian Council of Trade Unions' Congress last September demanded that the Commonwealth Government: Allocate sufficient finance at low interest rates to the State Housing Authorities to stop up home building. Arrange through banks and housing co-operatives for more long-term finance at low in terest rates to enable people with small deposits to purchase their own homes. The Congress also called on State Labor Councils and unions to lead a campaign, to include deputations to State Govern ments, in support of these demands. Last week the NSW Housing Industry Association warned Federal and State Ministers of widespread dismissals "unless urgent, immediate action is taken to overcome the situa tion." The association represents builders, manufacturers, sup pliers and professional men connected with the building industry in NSW. Mr. Purse said the Australian- wide figures show that ap provals or permits to build were down by over 30 per cent, for the three months ending February, 1066, compared with the same period the previous year.
