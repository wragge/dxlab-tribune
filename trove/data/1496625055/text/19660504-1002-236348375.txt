 ! II II HIM II— I I ! I jgj US Navy vetoes 1 riaht to work \ V " | pERTH: Can Australians be denied the right to work on Australian territory? Can they be sacked by a third party over the heads of their ; employer? The answer to these questions is yes — at the 3 North West Cape radio base. The WA. Trades and Labor Council was told last Tuesday how the sec urity permit of a trade un ionist working on the base had been revoked by the U.S. Navy. The dismissals and revo cations of security permits to work in the area occur red not because the people concerned were security risks but because they had engaged in industrial ac tion consistent with the terms of their award. In the case of one, the dismissal was not made by the employer, who was completely happy with the worker's services, but by the U.S. Navy. The only offence of this man— a member of the Electrical Trades Union— was his refusal to move out of good standard bachelor ac commodation ('for which he had an agreement with Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Ltd.) into 76- man barracks. The US Navy had taken over the accommodation from the first-stage con tractor Hardeman-Monier- Hutcherson. The worker's pass was revoked, but the Navy would not say why. A group of men at the base I had held about a dozen B % small stoppages over this 8 I and other matters, includ- | f ing demarcation disputes | fj when the employers in- 1 1 structed men to do work | I that should have been car- | 1 ried out only by a licenced B | electrical fitter. 1 The Council agreed to a B $ motion that unions with B members at the base B |f should take any steps ne- || cessary to overcome the ?&lt;j situation where Austra- '4 lians could be denied the it right to work on Austra- J$ lian territory. V| A deputation will wait || on the U.S. Navy and the council was also empow- fl ered to refer the matter to 11 the A.C.T.U. and A.L.P. '-f Federal Parliamentarians. ' 4; There was much critic- "H ism of foreign governments riding roughshod over the rights of Australian work- If ; ers within their own coun- ml try. T.L.C. Secretary J. Cole- m man said that two secur- |S ity screening systems were | used at the cape— one by f|| the civil commissioner and y| the other by the navy. | "They apparently swap | 1 notes and decide who will B Iff get a permit and who will If I' not," he told Council. 1 , Jf 'i of
