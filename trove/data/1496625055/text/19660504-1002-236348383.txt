 Domestic protest BBHanae I SUPPORT the recent de monstration of nurse s- which united women of all creeds in the common cause, but I deplore the use of wages of domestic staff as a lever for higher pay. Our wages may be more, but due to a chronic shortage of fully trained staff many domestics through compassion for the patients, perform many tasks .defined as nursing duties and so break down our own conditions which still have many anomalies. Both Tribune and the nurses campaign pamphlets were guilty of this. Domestic, Windsor (NSW)
