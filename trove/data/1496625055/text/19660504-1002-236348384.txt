 Wake up, Australia! IT must surely now he come apparent to all who have followed history durin? the last twenty years, that wherever there is injustice, corruption, and exploitation,, with all their allied evils, there wll be found the Americans back ing up the regime. Japan first, then Roxas in the Philippines, Syngham Rhee in Korea, Diem in Vietnam, Cuba, the Dominican Rep ublic, the Congo, and now the little Hitlers, Ky in Viet nam, and Suharto in Indon esia. Not fan behind in back ing them up are their lackeys the Aust Govt. Has any reader stopped' to inquire why1 Nagasaki, and Hiroshima were bombed, and \ not Tokio. Two bombs used ' when one would have had ' the same effect, and in fact i used weeks after the Japan - ese sued! for peace. Surely the Australian people must eventually wake up to what is going on.
