 "Serious situation" in high schools JYDNEY: The New South Wales Teachers' Fed eration announced last week that a "serious situation" facing secondary education in NSW would require the spending of $50 million above present allocations, to provide minimum necessary standards by the beginning of 1967. The statement said that in 1967 it is expected that the public high schools of New South Wales would accept an increase in enrolment greater than in any year in the history of the State. This arose from the 'addition of an estimated 13,000 sixth form students proceeding to the final year of the Wyndham Scheme of secondary education. This was over and above the normal increase in secondary enrolments which . for some years past had ranged between 5,000 and 10,000 students. "The situation creates prob lems of accommodation and staffing which can only be solved by the combined effort of the whole community. A lead to this effort must be given by our State and Commonwealth Parliamentary leaders," it said.
