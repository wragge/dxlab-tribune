 Dancers in a great tradition |N the last decade we have been brought closer to the culture of many countries by the visits of song and dance groups from Spain, Yugo slavia, China, India, Greece, Philipines, America, Africa, and t!:e song and dance ensembles of the various Soviet Republics — notably the Georgian and Siberian groups. Currently performing at the Tlvoli Theatre, the Berioska Dance Company of Moscow has 40 girls, and 30 men who will live up to the great tradition we have come to expect from dancers from this country. "Love for one's people, love for folk creation and a poet's eye to see it with, these are indispensable at tributes for all who work in the field of Folk Art" — the programmee tells us that this is the art creed of Madam Nadezhdina, the company's Director and choreographer. Members of the company bring to life these qualities in dances, both lyrical and vigorous. In a programme varying in mood, rich in colour and charm, the youthful boys and girls of this company to gether with the fine musi cians of the National Russian Orchestra win their audience to enthusiastic acclaim. Outstandingly effective are the dances that project the image of womanhood "pure and gentle, and as majestic and graceful as the birch tree". This image was most suc cessful in "Berioska", "The Swans", and "The Spinning Reel". By contrast "The Bachel ors", "The Jokers", "The Stamping Dance" and "The Cossack Suite" present the vigorous young blades of the company in fine style. .. Four Excellent soloists make the charming "Hand kerchief" dance the unique experience of the pro gramme and "Troika", a dance for three sojoists one of joy and vivre. From the whole ensemble "At the Autumn Fair" with colorful costumes, imagina tive movement and mime, and exciting music — brings the evening to a close. The curtain rises each night at the Tivoli Thea tre, at 8.15 p.m. until June 11. Be sure you are there on one of these nights! — N.D. & M.H.
