 [?] klR. T. L. LEWIS, IV1 NSW Liberal Min ister for Mines was quick off the mark to say no move would be made to prosecute the Australian Iron and Steel following Judge Goran's indict ment of the company ever the death of four Bulli miners. A 24-hour stoppage of all South Coast miners, together : with angry demonstrations, has at least caused him to seek legal advice on wbia.t lie should do. Miners' district secretary, Mr. Smart, told a mass meet ing last week of a strong blood-link between the Minis ter and the BHP's ex-chief. He is the nephew of Essing- ton Lewis! ? TTD HARVEY, the Labor Council secretary in Wollongong, tells of the so- called "safety record" at the .AI & S steelworks. Every day at least four or five workers hobble into the works while the company con tinues to minimise its records for "accident free days". The company, which carries its own compo scheme, is pre pared (at a small extra cost) to bring the injured in on full pay rather than show too many blots on their books. But if a worker prefers to go on compo and after a per iod is certified fit for light duties, he is told there are no light duty jobs! ? "yOMEN today take a vital part in production, said the NSW Metal Trades Fed eration of unions in a leaf let issued for national Equal Pay Week. Australian industry coul'd not do without them, as is seen by the fact that the Victorian Employers' Federation has called a conference on how best the large source of female labor, married women, may be used. The one subject not listed for discussion at the confer ence is equal pay. ? MELBOURNE wharfie weighs up justice. Recently' a magistrate fined a motorist $30 for having failed to give aid to two children he knocked down and injured on a cros sing. But over the last three weeks a Melbourne court has fined wharfies $75 for hav ing a smoke on the wharf.
