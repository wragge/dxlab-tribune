 MAY DAY IN MOSCOW OSCOW: The new types of solid fuel intercontinental and med ium range missiles which rumbled through Red square on mobile launch ers bore out Defence Minister Mali novsky's May Day warning to those increasing the war dang ers that the Soviet Union is "doing everything ne cessary to raise the coun try's defence potential ity." The self-propelled launching ramps seen in the May Day parade can keep rockets on the move in mountain, forest or swamp areas safe from detection. Among rockets on display were some which continually change course and cannot be tracked% or destroyed. Anti-aircraft rockets shown to have radio electronic hom ing devices which defy radio jamming and evasive action. Long range unmanned in terceptors which went past can strike both planes and missiles from the air. The mightiest of the anti missile missiles went through the Red Square in special containers. According to Tass they can destroy nuclear war heads of ballistic missiles at great distances. The giant orbital missiles can strike nuclear blows from any direction and from their size the underwater submarine missiles appeared to have tremendous range.
