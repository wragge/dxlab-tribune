 Not worth fighting for s the South Vietnamese Premier, Air Vice-Marshal Ky has spilt tire beans — the "elections" he pro mised earlier cannot now be arranged until this time next year. Understandably these statements by the Marshal, who claims Hitler as his hero, have aroused a fur ther outburst of protest from the masses of people in South Vietnam who have been showing their determination to topple the Ky dictatorship. Tribune warned in this column on April 27 that the election pledge might be another hoax. Now comes Ky's admission and, at the same time, a cable from Tribune's correspondent, Rupert Lock- wood in Moscow, warning that the United States Government has already secretly vetoed the "elec tions". Does this make sense, having in mind that US State Secretary Dean Rusk is busy re-wording Ky's statement and explaining that it has been "mis interpreted"? Yes, it does. The Americans remember very well the result of the; one and only all-Vietnam election (held after liberation in 1945) which showed, as the Americans then acknowledged, that the party headed by Pre sident Ho Chi-minh was the real leader of the nation. The Americans, through their then puppet Ngo Dinh Diem, saw to it that the French promise of elections in South Vietnam, made at Geneva in 1954, . was dishonoured. r. , II As the situation today in South Vietnam, with 80 pir cent of, the territory in the hands of the national liberation forces, is far worse for the Ameri cans than was 1954, why would Washington NOW willingly agree to "elections" — whether in three or thirty months? Ky's earlier promise, officially backed by the USA, can only be explained as an enforced manoeuvre, an attempt to gain time and to quieten the Buddhist- led upsurge of March and April.
