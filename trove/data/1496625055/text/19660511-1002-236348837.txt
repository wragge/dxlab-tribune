 ISOLATION The ringing of Hanoi with bombs, the tightening of the northern blockade, the dragging of Thai forces into the war, and the new US actions against Laos and Cambodia show the trend clearly. Expand the war, confuse the people of South Vietnamâ€” these are the tactics of the US "protectors of freedom", abetted by their compliant subordin ates, the Holt Government, busy committing more Australian ground and air forces to the inhuman war of intervention. But these tactics cannot succeed. In Vietnam itself, the people have a century's experience of dealing with foreign occupying pow ers; they outwitted and totally defeated the French, Europe's most sophisticated imperialists, and are now frustrating a massive US force on land, sea and air. Abroad, the USA has not only failed to carry its allies, but is losing them, France being the out standing example, and for reasons that include the Vietnam war. As US commentator Walter Lipmann wrote last week, the USA is "in the strange situation of being an isolated globalist power". He stressed that "in spite of . . . Rusk's 40-odd commitments to defend countries all over the world, we do not have one reasonably strong ally to share the risk and the costs of the Rusk policy". For these reasons, Prime Minister Holt's cheer-up talk on his return from Vietnam is no more than whistling in the dark. Unfortunately, however, Menzies and Holt have led Australia into a morally indefensible position, now emphasised by North Vietnam's complaint to the International Control Commission against Aus tralia's violation of the Geneva Agreement. Never before in history has Australia been placed in such a position. The Holt Government has much to pay for, and it must be- made to pay this year.
