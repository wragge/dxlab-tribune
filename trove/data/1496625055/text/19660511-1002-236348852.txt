 Cargo conference: UNIONS PRESS FOR BENEFITS /ANBERRA: It is expected that union leaders attend ing this week's Government sponsored conference on cargo handling will press for workers to share in the benefits from any improved handling methods. The Minister for Trade (Mr. McEwen) has called the con ference to consider the implic ations if container operations are introduced into the Aus tralian trade. Cargo will be loaded into containers, of about 25 tons capacity, at a terminal away from the wharf. Fully loaded containers are then taken to and loaded into specially con structed ships. The adoption of this method of handling would cut down costs due to the simplification of loading and unloading operations. The Waterside Workers Fed eration was refused on official invitation to the conference. However, the general secretary of the WWF, Mr. C. Fitzgibbon, will now attend as a represen tative of the ACTU. Mr. M. O'Brien, federal sec retary of the Australian Rail ways Union, is also attending the conference. Mr. N. Docker (WWF indus trial off iced) said this week that the Federation's policy is that workers should not suffer loss of work or conditions due to any new processes which increase output or effic iency. Workers should share in the benefits of these processes,"
