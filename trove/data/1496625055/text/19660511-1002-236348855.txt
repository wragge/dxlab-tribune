 1916 vote on conscription I gEING a disabled veteran digger of World War I, I would like to express my views on the conscription issue. During the 1916 Conscrip tion Referendum I was in an army convalescence base awaiting my return to Aus tralia. Out of 500 servicemen at the base, 75 per cent voted against conscription. It was common knowledge that con scription was not popular throughout the AIF bases. I have on various occasions been in close contact with tx-servicemen of the last war and members of the regular army, and have received an overwhelming verdict of no conscription. Having had two brothers killed: in action and myself a disabled veteran, it is appal ling that the young men of today should be forced to do the bidding of those who thrive on the business of war. I urge all returned service men and parents of all young men to let their opposition to conscription be known. A. Jones, Bicton (W A.)
