 Hoaxes in Vietnam Y>UR editorial of April 27 draws attention to the promise at Geneva in 1954 that the Vietnamese would be able to take part in) a nation-wide election no later than 1956. I feel that readers should also know that in January 1946 the whole of Vietnam went to the polls and some 90 per cent of the people voted for the Ho Chi-minh Government, and in Septem ber of that year Ho went to France and was acknow ledged by the French. It would appear that the Vietnamese people have been hoaxed more than once. H. Wijkinson, Petersham (N.S.W.)
