 Unions protest on car insurance JJYDNEY : Trade unions have called on the State Government to stop insurance companies increas ing insurance rates by 20 per cent on cars sold on hire purchase. This was decided last week when the New South Wales Labor Council condemned the imposition of the increase. The arbitrary decision by the companies came into effect on May 2 and will affect about 40 per cent of new and 60 per cent of second hand vehicles sold in NSW. Earlier, Justice Minister, ' Maddison, tabled in the House a move to delete regulation 5 of the NSW Hire Purchase Act. This regulation fixes the rates of insurance for vehicles under hire purchase. The NSW Branch of the Building Workers' Industrial Union sponsored the protest resolution unanimously carried by Labor Council. The union said it understands that the State Government tabled this regulation only three days prior to the adjourn ment of Parliament. Objections According to the law these matters must remain tabled in both Houses for 15 sitting- days during which time objections may be made by either House. "There are still 12 sitting days in which objections can be made, yet the insurance companies have taken advan tage of the adjournment of Parliament to impose these heavy increases," the BWIU said. Mr. T. McDonald (BWIU assistant secretary) said the whole matter shows a con spiracy between the Govern ment and the companies. "Now by 'jumping the gun' the insurance companies are usurping the authority of the Government.'? He said that these high in creases in rates will in the main affect workers. Council also congratulated the Labor Opposition for its declared intention to defeat the move in the Legislative Council.
