 Stalin and the Right I DONT appreciate being lectured on Stalin's "enormities" by someone like Dr. Knopfelmacher (see The Australian, May 3) and similar rightwing- ers whose policy of en circling and attacking the USSR created the only conditions in which the "enormities" could have been committed. After all, who was mainly to blame for the1 French reign of terror in 1791 â€” the Jacob ins, who were responsible for the defence of the new Re public, or the feudal powers whose invasion made action against traitors and suspects understandable if not excus able? - I may perhaps be forgiven for not regarding as fount ains of infallible wisdom per sons who, while warning us weightily about Stalin (as part of their general hate- Russia campaign) told us that Hitler was a harmless nationalist visionary, Musso lini made the trains run on time, and Tojo and his mates were charming chaps who would leave us alone if we sold them pig iron. Above all, we were told to shun, as the worst of disas ters and "red plots", the com munist-initiated proposal for an Anglo-American-Soviet al liance to stop fascism. I don't know whether Dr. K. was among those "authori- ties" or not, but they are the same as those who now win his approval for boosting Mar shal Ky in Vietnam. How many people are to die be fore they admit that they are just as mistaken about Ky as they were about Hitler? W.W., Sydney.
