The daily papers, he pointed out, charge only five cents, whereas Tri bune costs eight cents and has not nearly so many 1 pages. What our friend had for gotten is the enormous amount of advertising the dailies get, charging high retes even for classified ads. Tribune, too, is now tak ing a modest amount of paid advertising, but it doesn't pay the bills. Donations this week: Printer 17c, E. P; Key 16c, R.L.
