 WA unions' policy on o'seas ships OERTH: The WA Trades E and Labor Council has E issued a strong declaration I of policy on several ifiatters 1 affecting the maritime in dustry. Unions affiliated with the Council will deny all services to any" overseas ships which use crew labor to clean or fit holds or tanks for loading cargo at Australian ports. Any action to get this work guaranteed by law for shore based labor will be endorsed. The ACTU and all state bran ches have been asked for their support in this matter. WA Premier Brand is to be asked to set a definite date for the removal of foreign flag ships trading on the WA coast. A deputation will seek to tell the Premier that the Council cannot tolerate this threat to the livelihood of Australian workers and to the economic running of the State Shipping Service, and that pending their removal, all such ships must apply the same standards of wages and conditions as Aus tralian ships. The Council made a vigorous protest against Transport Min ister Freeth's apparent support for foreign-controlled oil com panies in their attempt to force the Australian owned Miller tankers out of the coastal oil- carrying trade and so regain their monopoly. The resolution condemned this as against the interests of the Australian people and declared that the trade union movement would resist it. All the resolutions were adopted without dissent after a report by secretary J. Cole man on a meeting of the Mar ine Transport group.
