 [?] With Tribune's Industrial j Roundsman UMMONW EALTH public servants are in an angry mood over the Federated Clerks' Union j appeal against a new award. The appeal lodged by Clerks' Federal secretary, J. Riordan. threatens the whole award and f its application to other Com- m monwealth Departments. , Sj "White Collar", journal of i the N.S.W. Branch of the Ad- | ministrative and Clerical Offi- cers' Association, says the p Clerks' Union was influenced | by a few senior technical offi- 1 cials who are aggrieved that | other public servants should I receive similar wage adjust- I ments. I Meanwhile the appeal means j that about 22,000 public ser vants are losing thousands of j dollars each . week and that , | salary justice will be delayed for over six months. Cynical members of the asso ciation claim that the Clerks' Union is saving the Public Ser vice Board the dirty task of appealing against the award.
