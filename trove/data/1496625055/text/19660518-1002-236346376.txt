 In WA, equal margin campaign pERTH: A highlight of the year in West Australia was the test case for equal pay taken to the In dustrial Commission by the Miscellaneous Workers Union backed by the Trades & Labor Council. On appeal, the full Indus trial Commission upheld Commissioner Kelly's judg ment that while there could be equal pay in special cases it could not be granted with out substantial amendments to the Arbitration Act;, and so placed the onus of res ponsibility on the govern ment. In a welter of specious arguments, buckpassing and thieats against general wage standards, the State govern ment decided to take no action, and returned the onus of res- ponsibility to the Court. Federal Labor Minister M'c- Mahon told an ACTU deputat ion in 1964 that equal pay was a duty of sate governments. Fremier Brand, in annouc- ing his Cabinet's decision not to change the faulty wage provisions of the Industrial Arbitration Act said a change as fundamental as this should be Australia-wide and not by cne State. The Parliamentary Ijabor Party announced in February that it would seek amend ments to the W.A. arbitration law in parliament this year to give the Industrial Com mission discretionary power tq grant women equal pay for equal work. Following on the Court v. Cabinet impasse the Trades & Labor Council decided that as part of the overall objective of full equal pay, to. increase its activities for equal margins as an immediate realisable gain and a lift in margins for those women workers who per form work not done by men. About 80 different unions in W.A. are expected to file applications with the Court along these lines.
