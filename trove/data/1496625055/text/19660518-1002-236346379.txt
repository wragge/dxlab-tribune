 ABC's new drama series jpHE A.B.C. is to be con gratulated on Its new drama series "Australian Playhouse'?, which aims to give Australian playwrights a chance to prove their abil ity and to improve by see ing their work performed. This series of half-hour plays is presented in Sydney on Channel 2 on Monday at 8 pm, a good viewing time. As the first in the series "The Pigeon" was the sym pathetic study of a sensitive teenager who was frustrated by unsuitable backgrounds at home and school, his strug gle against the forces that wished to make him conform to their standards was well portrayed. "The Tape Recorder", the secoend play, again showed effective use of television techniques, in creating sus pense and revealing character. It was a very interesting ex periment, as it consisted of only anei actress and a re corded voice. Tension was most successfully built up to a definite though unstated ending. "The Air-Conditioned Au thor", televised on May 2, was a thought - provoking study of the effect of success on a once earnest and ideal istic young author. Within the limitations of half-an- hour, the forces that trans formed him into a cynical writer of "best sellers" were cleverly shown. The series merits the sup port of all viewers. The three Australian authors whose dramas have so far been pre- sented have shown their abil ity to write well and her- estingly, and the technical features such as sets ana camera work have been wel up to overseas standards. Each play has dealt with a real situation in Australian life and. has shown the wide spread concern among auth ors at the harmful socia pressures of modern society- I suggest that watch Australian next Monday and write the ABC to show apprecia tion of. their efforts to a - velon a national drama.
