 Indonesia IN "Plain Australian" Tri bune, March 16) a refer ence was made to "greater Indonesia" expanionist possi bilities with the caution, "It is too early to make firm predictions. But . . ." I think it would be better to reinforce the cautious atti tude rather than raise, in any form, the "danger from the North" tradition, no matter how expedient it may seem in view of the extreme right wing character of sections of the present Indonesian ruling force. In making a relatively small point, one could unwit tingly concede a bigger one and give unscrupulous and opportunist demagogic in fluences yet another excuse to whip up vague fears which slumber in the hearts and memories of Austra lians. Despite the temporary poli tical changes in Inodnesia I think it still better, in the long run, to concentrate on explaining the terribly weak industrial and economic base of multl-millioned Indonesia and its long term programme to resettle surplus popula tions in its own under-popu lated "Wild East" of Kaliman- ton, which is far mpre inviting and available than New Guinea and Arnhem Land.
