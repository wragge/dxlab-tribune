 Persecution of overseas Chinese F. my early youth in Cen tral Europe I saw the deportation of Jews to the death camps. Later I met a iew or inem wno nan evaded deportation and lived the life of fugitives to the end of the war. Today we witness a hew fugitive race — the overseas Chinese. They are victimised in the Philippines, herded into con centration camps , in Sarawak, killed in Indonesia— "in the name of Allah, the compas sionate, the merciful". These are the words of the Moslem Koran and certainly do not justify violence against inno cent people. Recently a Chinese busi nessman was executed in Saigon for "economic of fences". The Chinese communities in South-East Asia have little or no interest in local politics. They are hard working, ar tistic and intelligent people. J. Alio, Perth (W.A.)
