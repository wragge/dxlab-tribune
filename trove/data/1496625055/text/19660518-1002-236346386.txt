It vindicates Professor Orr without restoring him to his former post— something even he perhaps would not seek at this moment. Professor Orr led a move ment for reform at the uni versity which had the back ing of staff and students, and won a great measure of suc cess. In return he received treatment more to be ex pected from Chicago gang sters or the US Central Intel ligence Agency than from a . body purporting to set an ex ample to the community in intellect, morals and culture. He was framed on a sex charge, sacked, beaten up, shot at and wounded and sub jected to gruelling court and newspaper publicity covering every aspect of his life— pub lic and private. Communications he made to professional men, and which he might have expected to be treated as confidential, were used to hold him up to public derision and obloquy. Significant was Bishop Cranswick's later statement alleging, in effect, that he had been trapped into taking part in a frame-up. University staff, members throughout Australia who stood solidly with Professor and in effect declared his Chair black, may well feel that they helped to preserve the honor of Australia and the reputation of its univer sities.
