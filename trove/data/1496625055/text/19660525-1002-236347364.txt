 HASLUCK 'MISLEADING' SAYS SEN. TURNBULL CENATOR Turnbull has accused the Minister for External Affairs (Mr Hasluck) of giving "mis leading, inaccurate, if not deliberately untruthful," reports to Australia on Vietnam. He said in Launceston, "The news of the internal fighting in Vietnam should open the eyes of all doubters in Aus tralia to the fact that the masquerade of our Government —that we are fighting in Viet nam to contain communism- is now too absurd to continue. "I call on the Prime Minis ter to tell Australia the truth. "We have had enough of the misleading, inaccurate, if not deliberately untruthful, state ments of our Minister for Ex ternal Affairs (Mr. Hasluck). "Mr. Hasluck has oh two occasions deliberately echoed his master's voice— the voice of Mr. Rusk (the US Secretary of State). "In fact, as far as Vietnam is concerned, we may as well let Mr. Rusk be our Minister for External Affairs: "The sooner the Americans and our boys get out of Viet nam, the better for that coun try."
