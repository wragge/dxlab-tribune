 WIW' THE'. INDUSTRIAL SCENE . Wage rises for Q'land, WA workers By an Industrial Correspondent JYDNEY : Increases won last week will be most prominent in workers' minds as the national wage case continues its dreary lengthy hearing before the Commonwealth Arbitration Commission. These increases are: — $1.30 increase in the Queensland State basic wage. $4.30 increase in the margin for tradesmen covered by the West Australian State metal trades award. Such increases— especially that in relation to the Queensland State basic wage— are not re garded as satisfying the nation al claims, which are for $4.30 basic wage increase and $5.90 on tradesmen's margins. But workers will regard these increases as setting a floor upon which the Commonwealth Arbi tration should build in deter mining the national claims. The increases make nonsense of the employers' claims that the economy can afford only a maximum wage increase of 60c for tradesmen and less for other workers. They point to the fact that tradesmen in the very much smaller metal industry in the state of Queensland have now received an increase equal to 24 times 60c and in Western Australia 74 times greater than the employers said was the max imum economically possible. The increases in these two States make the award rates for tradesmen in the respective State metal trades awards al most identical and very much in excess of the rates in the Federal Metal Trades award and other Federal and State awards based on it." The follow ing figures reveal the position: Current Current Total Basic Margin Award Wage Rate $ $ $ Sydney 31.50 11. 20 42.70 Melbourne 30.70 11.20 41.90 Adelaide 30.30 11.20 41.50 Hobart 31.40 11.20 42.60 Brisbane 32.70 15.50 48.20 Perth 32.65 15.50 48.15 6 Capital Cities Average 30.80 1 1 .20 42.00 This means that the wealthy BHP and its big associated in dustries in NSW, plus other big wealthy metal employers in NSW, pay their metal tradesmen award rates which are $6.50 less than small metal employers in Brisbane and $6.45 less than similar employers in Perth. Big metal employers in Mel bourne get away with award rates which are a further 80c lower than these figures. The $1.30 rise in the Queens land State basic wage highlights the injustice inflicted on those Queensland workers covered by Federal awards. Subject to exactly the same living costs, Federal award workers in Brisbane get a basic wage which is $3.70 LESS per week than those workers in the same city covered by State awards. The $1.30 increase restores the Queensland State basic wage to the amount it would have been if quarterly adjustments had not been halted during the last 12 months. This amount does not provide any reward for increas ed productivity. It was the lowest claim made by the unions. It was advanced by a small group of unions not affiliated to the Queensland Labor Coun cil and headed by the Austra lian Workers Union and Clerks union. The big body of unions, all Labor Council affiliates, sought an increase of $4.30 with an in terim increase of $2.50. To restore Federal basic wage rates to the purchasing power they had when last fixed (June 1964) increases of $2.20 to $2.40 would be needed. These are the amounts plus $1 for increased productivity., which the unions are claiming in the national wage case. The new margins in WA and the new basic wage in Queensland make each of these rates — basic wage and margins — approximately the same, and at $15.50 the mar gin for a metal tradesman in each State equals 47.4 per cent of the basic wage in each State. To make the current tradesmen's margin of $11.20 in the Federal Metal Trades award equal 47.4 per cent of the current 6 Capital Cities Average basic wage, an increase of $3.40 is needed. To make the mar gin equal 47.4 per cent of the same basic wage adjusted for price rises since June 1964 an increase of $4,50 is needed. The ACTU claim at $5.90 seeks to restore the margin to its 1947 per centage (48.6 per cent) of the in creased ' basic wage claimed in tho award case. The W.A. margins claimed flowed out of a series of actions by metal workers in that State for over-award payments and other increases. The basic wage case in Queensland was accompanied by a State-wide campaign of mass action by workers.
