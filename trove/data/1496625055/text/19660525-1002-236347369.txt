 Seamen, forgotten men QYDNEY: "For too long British seamen have been forgotten men, tak ing aU the kicks, yet called on ro mane me I sacrifices in time of war and national crisis," Mr. O. T. Yates, the Austra lian representative of the National Union of British Seamen, said last week. He was commenting to Tribune on the current British seamen's strike. Mr. Yates has an office in Sydney and he looks after the interests of Bri tish seamen in Australia. "Our main target is to win the 40-hour week. British seamen now work 56 hours to get a wage of £14, while unskilled work ers at home are getting ,this and more for a 40- hour week. "Seamen work 40 hours in port, but 56 hours at sea. "We are demanding and we won't man ships till we get a 40-hour week at I sea and £60 a month for AB's, with a correspond ing adjustment on deck, in the engine room and cat e r i n g departments," Mr. Yates said. "The final offer of the shipowners which we re jected was a 40-hour week in three annual stages, direct overtime for all hours at week-ends and on public holidays again in three stages, a 12/6 a. month increase for AB's and an increase of 20 days annual leave. "In return we would have had to agree to the withdrawal of the Sunday at sea leave agreement,, meaning an average loss of 37 days paid compen satory leave a year and a ' freeze on wage increases for three years. "We rejected their offer because the 40-hour week at sea would not have come till 1968. I,t would also take away the Sunday a,t sea leave without ade quate replacement by an nual leave, and even though there might still be opportunities for over time earnings the basic rate would stand still for three years," Mr. Ya,tes said. Mr. Yates added that British seamen now in Australia are keen to get home as soon as possible to join in picketing and other strike activities. MR. O. T. YATES I
