There are 63,000 seamen on strike. On the eve of. the strike, while seamen demonstrated outside No. 10 Downing Street, their leaders inside rejected' the offer and refused to call off the strike. Aided by Labor Minister Ray Gunther, Mr. Wilson warned f the adverse effects of the strike on the economy. Together with Mr. Bill Ho garth, General secretary of the National Union- of Seamen, 10 members of his executive Com mittee explained the men's case. The union has £130,000 in ready cash and! has taken steps to borrow another £250,000' and the men will receive a £3 a week dispute benefit.
