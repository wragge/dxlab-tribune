 Relieving the burden for working mothers By a Correspondent pERTH: As nearly one in three of all married women in. Aus tralia has an outside job and 36 per cent of these are aged between 20 and 44, the question naturally arises: What happens to the children after school? Contrary to the widely held view that they don't care, working mothers are constantly fighting within themselves a battle of divided loyalties. They worry about what happens to their children after school, when they are not at home to care for them, and they worry because they find stimu lation in working and being away from home. Some of the answer to this problem is being given by a Perth group — Children's Activ ities Time Society (Inc.), known as CATS— -which organised ac tivities for children during the school holidays. That mothers appreciate the C.A.T.S. festivals is demonstrat ed by the fact that during the January, May and August holi days last year over 8,750 chil dren attended programmes of ballet, puppet making, play reading and entertainment "in the round". But like all pioneer groups C.A.T.S. is working on a shoe string budget, often being un able to pay travelling expenses to the artists who give their services free. To really meet the demand for this type of children's activ ity backing is needed— from the Education Department or the Australian Broadcasting Com mission — in the opinion of one of the organisers.
