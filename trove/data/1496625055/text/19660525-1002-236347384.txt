 Block blockade! — REPORTS this week of increasing Soviet shipping traffic through Suez to Haiphong (North Viet nam) are accompanied by renewed talk of block ading or bombing that port — a favorite ambition of the hawks in Washington. In fact, supplies to North Vietnam are going not only on Soviet ships but also on British vessels, for example. If most ships are from the Soviet Union, " principal support and supplier of the Vietnamese fight for independence, this is in part due to con tinuing difficulties reported in land transport across China. Any attempt at a blockade of Haiphong against such shipping would not only be a totally unjusti fiable extension of the existing US aggression against North Vietnam; it would also bring closer world war between the Great Powers. Australian naval vessels, operating in Vietnam waters under US general command, could become . involved in blockading just as they have been used in the Malaysia-Indonesia confrontation. The Holt Government should immediately dissociate the RAN and RAAF from any such dangerous schemes. Ls»eass=sssESS=saEssaB«»sssssss3=3KssssB=8as
