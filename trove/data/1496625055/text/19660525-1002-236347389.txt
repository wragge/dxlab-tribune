 The Author and Society CYDNEY : "Writers cannot keep on giving out and 1 not taking in something," said Charmian Clift last Wednesday night as guest speaker at the open ing of new clubrooms for the Fellowship of Aus tralian Writers, at 189 Clarence Street, Sydney. "It is only from the society in which we live that we can understand what is happening and give back in writing what we have learnt. "There has been built up an Australian image that is out moded â€” the drover, gum trees, kangaroos. We need to see the flowering of a new. image. "Instead of waiting for some thing to happen, writers must help make something happen." Prominent writers and artists present included Olaf Ruhen, Pixie O'Harric and Doris Fitton, O.B.E. Messages of greeting and welcome to the new club rooms were received from a number of well-known writers from Sydney, Melbourne and Perth. CHARMIAN CLIFT
