 and the menj sailing her to Vietnam! Sandy Strachan was one of the I men rostered onto the Boonaroo i at the Sydney pick-up centre last I Monday. ! He said the navy vessel HMAS I Sydney came info port at the same j time as the Boonaroo . j "The boys must get supplies while they are in Vietnam, but why couldn't the "Sydney" take them as it has in the past? "All the boys who signed on the Boon aroo today would gladly go and bring our boys back," he said. John Young, the father of a four-year- old son, said: "There isadeliberate, planned attack upon our union. "Thene has never been any question of the troops being without materials." Brian Anderson, 11 years at sea, said he would "like to be bringing the Aussies home from this dirty wan" John Graham, the father of two small children, said he fully backed the stand taken by his union. Morrie Jackson is the standby on the roster which means he will man the ship if someone drops out. Although only a J young man of about J 25 he regarded the J Government's de- i cision to send the j Boonaroo as "Holt's 1 last chance to find a j loophole to divert I attention from his 1 J policy on Vietnam." j Harry Leonard J missed out on the J roster. He said when j the ship goes up to 1 Vietnam it will be a j peace ship â€” not of j war. j "We hope the j Boonaroo incident ( will lead to the down- j fall of the Holt Gov- i ernment," he said. \ JOHN YOUNG BRIAN ANDERSON SANDY STRACHAN E.
