 Army morale JF Prime Minister Holt had stayed in the army longer than he did, he would have found out that official re- ports on morale are, like most things in the army made to order. I can well remember the big flaps when I was station ed in Cyprus. When any V.I.P. came for a look round, and I can well imagine what went on at Bien Hoa before Mr. Holt got there. The tent lines given that extra sweep out, lavatories scrubbed and new toilet rolls placed on their lit tle racks. Then the greatest exhibition of all— the cook house. at lunch time with the cooks immaculate in best whites serving up chicken with roast potatoes as crisp as any conscript's mother ever baked. Just when you're tucking in and wondering why it can't be like this every day the big man himself appears with the sergeant major at his heels. How are you, son? You smile up at him and say "good, thank you sir." Then it's any complaints? No, no one ever | complains nor is ever game W- | This was ' the high I the Prime Minister saw, W I if he could have heard tn real talk round the tent lines g he certainly would have hear | a few complaints. | This is what I experienced. g but without the ever-pr® 1 danger of being wounded I killed, so I know what tn | boyis must really be thinking | If Mr. Holt had one spark | human feeling he worn | order all boys out of Vietnam | immediately. 11 R.
