 Berioska dancers FTER meeting some of the lovely girls from the Berioska Dance Company at a luncheon given by the Un- ion of Australian Women last ween, y was anxious to see them on stage. They did not do anything that many young healthy peo ple, sound of body and mind could not do, yet the way they did it was both rare and de lightful. The audience showed by their spontaneous clapping, too spontaneous at times, that they also wanted to feel they were part of this young, vigor ous, appealing group. The sheer beauty of their actions and the honour given to their womanhood could be deeply felt. There are no adjectives to express how happy this Com pany made us feel. They are a real anodyne to the perform ances too often served up to us from a bored old western world. AND there was not one bare hip a-wiggle in the whole of this wholesome perform ance. What a relief! THANK YOU, BOYS AND â€ž GIRLS OF THE BERIOSKA DANCERS FOR A RARE TREAT. WE WILL BE SOR RY TO SEE YOU GO. E. Leahy, Ramsgate (N.S.W.)
