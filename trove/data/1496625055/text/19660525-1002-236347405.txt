 Vietnam -'J'HE political arguments of the apologists for the war in Vietnam cannot for ever pull the wool over the eyes ot the people as to what is really happening in Vietnam. People in South Vietnam have become openly anti- American and also have de manded the removal of the US puppet Ky and a democratical ly conducted election. Reports on the situation in Vietnam in the press and other propaganda media are deceitful propaganda. , The combined foreign military forces in Vietnam fighting so- called "communist aggression" are really fighting against a people trying to establish their own form of government, to determine the domestic wel fare of their country as they deem fit. Evidence is ample to. show that the Ky dictatorship is in discord with the people. In support of this recently the head of the US Armed Ser vices Committee, Senator Russell, in a World News Re port as published, in Time, said "America should get out of Vietnam." And the people of Australia must demand that Australian troops be recalled. G. Mulholland, Hamilton (N.S.W.)
