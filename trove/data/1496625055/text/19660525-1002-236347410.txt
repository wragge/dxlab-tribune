 Who is this James Cameron? to t&e ABN Channel 2 Four Corners on Saturday la3t televised James Cam eron's visit to North Vietnam. . Four Corners deserves cre- dit for showing the Australian . people that North Vietnamese are ordinary people, trying to go about their business of raising crops, feeding the nation, carrying on with their industry in the face of terror from US bombings. This film is based on James Cameron's book WITNESS, the complete story of his journey to North Vietnam in the late winter of 1965. As he explains, for the best part of a year he persisted in his applications to visit that country and finally achieved his objective. Cameron, who is one of the most highly respected inter national , correspondents in British journalism, says he .went uncommitted and un- sponsored; he was nobody's guest, and nobody's delegate. He writes: "In the end, then, I got in. I saw Hanoi again for the first time since I was there, in the twilight, of French Indo- Chma, writing about its dis solution in the New Chron icle .... "I am a Westerner; I have spent much of my life in odd and improbable places, and I have become deeply attached' to Asia over the years; yet I remain a European even by inclination. I can hardly pretend that this narrative is the 'truth' about North Vietnam; an ex perience of this kind is un likely to produce a heavy harvest of eternal verities. Still, I travelled about the country; I did not see every thing I might have wished to see, but I saw a great deal more than has been seen for a "long time." And., as was seen on Four Corners, Cameron was actual ly in Hanoi, when US planes were bombing the city. He saw a hospital which had been bombed and visited peo ple who had to leave the city for "it was not safe for people to live near a bridge."
