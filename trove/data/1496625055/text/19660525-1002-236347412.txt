 B.H. miners in wage dispute gROKEN HILL: About 2,000 miners have begun a go-slow protest against a company campaign, of cutting down on wages and workers. They began the go-slow on Tuesday morning after a meeting with the manage ment and the unions- failed to resolve the dispute. The mines involved are the Zinc Corporation and' New Broken Kill Consolidated who have threatened to cut out the lead bonus because of the go-slow. The Workers' Industrial Union claims that its mem bers the miners are not breach ing the award, but the com panies are. Members of the Amalgamated Engineering Union said on Monday that they would not work if the lead bonus was stopped. Other Unions are expected to take the same stand. This would involve the powerful Barrier Industrial Council and all the workers in Broken Hill could' then become involved. The dispute began in the middle of last year, but the miners continued to work as usual until last April. 'l 'H A tvi InAn A1«- k«f AUG lUUlCd a A e WtiliUliGU UJ Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd.
