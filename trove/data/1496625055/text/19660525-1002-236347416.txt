 SA Minister attacks Govt, on pamphlet DELAIDE: The SA Min ister of Education (Mr. Loveday) has condemned the Holt Federal Government's action in sending a booklet on Vietnam to SA schools. The Minister has advised headmasters that the booklet, entitled "Vietnam â€” questions answers", was NOT to be dis tributed to school children, except in cases of special study. A previous Federal Govern ment booklet on Vietnam was sent to headmasters and the Minister also prevented its distribution to school children. Mr. Loveday said then that people could object to one side of the case being put to a "captive audience". "I have had a brief look at this new booklet , and I think some of the statements are open to considerable doubt," said Mr. Loveday. He described the Holt Gov ernment's action as "extremely discourteous."
