Tribune Ball on August 20 CYDNEY: The State Ballroom, Market Street, Sydney has been booked for the 1966 Tribune Ball on Saturday, August 20. The State Ballroom will accommodate only 420 people. As last year's attendance was over 600, we sound a strong note of warning to book early! The rule will be strictly preference in order of booking. Many people last year dis- ' covered that forgetting to bring tickets or intending to pay at the door meant long delays and even failure to gain admission. It is a violation of the law for tickets to be sold at the door for these functions. They must be purchased in advance. Tickets will only be avail able from 168 Day Street. They can be ordered now. Because of the limited, accom modation, tickets must be paid for by Monday, August 8. From that date unpaid tickets will be sold. The price is $3 (30/-) each. Cheques, money orders, postal notes may be posted and tickets will be returned. Dancing will be from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. with a delicious Slip per. POPULAR SELLER RULES 1.
