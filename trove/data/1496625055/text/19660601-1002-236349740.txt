He spoke of the failure of the U.S. military policy in Vietnam and how the troops of the U.S. and its allies "are up to their necks in the bog of war". He was confident of the outcome of the struggle. "Nguyen Thi Binh also ex pressed the people's conviction that they would win and the' the USA would be forced to "withdraw their forces from Vietnam." "We Australian communists say it is now more important than ever for the people t0 demand the withdrawal of Australian forces from Viet nam.
