 BUIZKRIEG : QN August 5, 1964, carrier- based US planes in the Gulf of Tonking raided four ports of the Democratic Re- public of North Vietnam. As Dr. J. F. Cairns, Labor MHR said at the time: "No one could say America was being attacked." In February 1965 the US, again without the slightest provocation by the north Vietnamese, began its heavy and continuous bombing raids on the DRV. On February 9, 1965 the London Times' Washington correspondent said the raids had been planned two months earlier. Labor Leader Calwell on May 18 condemned the mass US bombing destruction of "villages and food supplies, bridges, roads and railways and other essential parts of the economic infrastruc ture . . . the livelihood of the ordinary Vietnamese." Thus the US Government, on the one hand, engages in an unprovok ed air war of aggression against the socialist North Vietnam; on the other hand, it refuses to con sider the peace terms of the Nat ional Liberation Front of South Vietnam on the ground that the fighting there is due to "aggression from the North". But the Australian Army's Ad jutant-General (quoted by the Syd ney Bulletin last November 20) admitted that the "Viet Cong" (NLF forces) was "a formidable enemy fighting on his home ter ritory." Sir Robert Menzies, then Austra lian Prime Minister, said on April 7, 1965, that if he were the last Prime Minister of the Common wealth to oppose negotiations, he would still oppose them. The late Adlai Stevenson, US Ambassador ' to the UN, revealed late in 1965 he had been told by UN secretary-general U Thant that in 1964, before the US raids began, north Vietnam sought talks with the USA. However, said Stevenson, the ap proach was rejected. Australia and other "allies" were not even in formed.
