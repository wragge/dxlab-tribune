 Qn Indonesia 'T'HE following is a copy of a letter sent by the French's Forest Branch, Communist Party of Austra- lia to the Indonesian Ambas sador: We have been shocked by reports of carnage and slaugh ter in Indonesia as little by little, the horrible details are being made known to the out side world. It is reported that the vic tims were mainly Commun ists, trade unionists, progress ive intellectuals and others selflessly devoting themselves to their country's problems, that the number of dead is about a quarter of a million, that many political prisoners are still being held without trial, and that men continue to be victimised for the beliefs they hold. This letter is in protest against the reported mass killings and we should be pleased if you would convey this protest to the present heads of your country. We look forward to the day when our two countries will be friendly peaceful neigh bours, trading with each other, the people of both free to choose their religious and political beliefs without fear of persecution, as set out in the United Nations Charter. E. Morcom, French's Forest.
