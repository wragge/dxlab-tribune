 U.S. steps up war drive Confirmation of recent aggressive Ameri can actions suggests a plan to escape difficulties in Vietnam by widening the war. For example: — ® MAY 12— us planes fly into China, bring1 down a Chinese training plane MAY 21 — US troops a£ Guan,tanomo Shoot down a Cuban sentry. 0 MAY 28 — US warplanes attack a Chinese fishing fleet in the Gulf of Tonking, three killed. A warning by US Senator- Wayne Morse last Thursday that the US is "planning a war with China and our build-up . here is based on that as sumption" has been rapidly followed a.nd confirmed by events. . On Friday the Columbia Broadcasting System admitted that the Chinese Government was correct in alleging that on May 12, US planes had invaded China and shot down a Chinese training plane. On top of this comes a Chin ese Government statement that two US planes on Saturday had bombed and strafed a Chinese fishing .fleet in inter national waters in the Gulf of Tonking. The attack killed three Chin ese and injured 18, while sink ing a boat and damaging two others. All were flying "the Chinese flag. . At the same time, in its own hemisphere the US Army pro voked a diversionary incident with Cuba by the shooting of a Cuban sentry near Guantanomo naval base — the base which the US illegally seized from Cuba in 1903. The Cuban armed forces were put on the alert and in reply to a Cuban appeal, the Soviet Government pledged its full support of Cuba in the event of an American attack. In his statement warning against war with China, Sen ator Wayne Morse said the Australian Government had be come a mere puppet following the US' "bloody policy in Viet nam". Australia, like the US, has be come "an international outlaw by supporting on immoral and un constitutional foreign policy in this war, which is a sin against hum anity," said Morse.
