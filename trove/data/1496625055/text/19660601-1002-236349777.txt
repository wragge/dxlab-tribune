 McMAHON'S "GREAT MOMENT IN HISTORY" gYDNEY: The Federal Treasurer, Mr. McMahon, caused an uproar when he told a public .meeting last Friday in Sydney that Australia's participation in the Vietnam war "is one of our great moments in history." Over 200 attended the meeting at the Earlwood Methodist Hall, called by the Liberal Party to allow Mr. McMahon and Liberal Mem ber for Parkes (Mr. T. Hughes) to explain the gov ernment's policy on Vietnam. The speakers were contin ually bombarded with interjec tions and at times a noisy section of the audience shouted down the speakers. Many at the meeting later stated that the attempts to disrupt the meeting detracted from the public's desire to question the Government's pol icy. The Treasurer evaded the question: "Who is the democratically elected government, which has the support of the South Viet namese people, which we are sending troops to protect? To another question he said: "We are there at the requesl of the legitimate Government of South Vietnam. "It's not possible to get a vote there, that is true, but the people are behind their Government." Further questioned on the statement by Air-Marshal Ky that Hitler was his idol, Mr McMahon said: "We are not there to sup port Ky, but the people's de sire for freedom."
