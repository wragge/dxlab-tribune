The telegraphists are in censed at the Board's refusal to grant them increases fol lowing the $250 a year in crease granted last week to postal clerks. Sydney telegraphists who stopped for an hour last Thurs day, had called for the nation wide stoppage. Last Friday's meeting de- cided to postpone any further action pending the outcome of a hearing of their claims by the Public Service Arbitrator who has now agreed to deal with these claims on June 8. The men had previously de cided to consider a national 24-hour strike and a work to regulations as part of their campaign.
