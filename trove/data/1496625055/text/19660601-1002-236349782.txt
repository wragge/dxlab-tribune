 fjj A tenner from the 0M Man' By JUNE MILLS "THE anti-Vietnam war protest action of the Sea men's Union around the manning of the Boon- aroo and Tribune's extensive coverage of the struggle inspired a $1.52 donation to Tribune j Fund this week from Canterbury. This was one of a num ber of donations this week which have sent the fund indicator over the $1,600 mark. I We particularly welcome the visit from "The Old Man" and his donation of $10 and note with pleasure j.A.C.'s donation from Queensland. Newcastle's Butch Whar ton, always on the alert for donations while selling Tribune, wrote last week that two regular customers always give him 30c to 40c donation; -other people I passing his stand give him a donation even though they buy the Tribune at work or are subscribers. Other street sellers — Les and Bob of Bankstown, Bill Fitzpatrick of Oxford Street and others — Bill White in the Domain, do a very good job for the Fund. Keep it up, boys, Tribune needs the money.
