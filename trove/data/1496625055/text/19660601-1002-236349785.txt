 'Vote not enough' -WIDF loader CYDNEY : One of the greatest problems facing Aus- tralia was that of obtaining equal pay for women, said visiting women's leader Betty Harrison. Miss Harrison, who was speaking at a reception given in her honour at the BWIU hall, last Thursday represented the Women's Internationa) Democratic Federation at the UAW National Conference. "If you are to maintain a full economy and make the country bigger and better, you cannot do it without the work of women in industry." Miss Harrison continued. Australia was one of the first countries to give the vote to women, Miss Harrison said, but the vote was not enough. "No man can be free so long as another section of the community has discrimination practised against it," she em phasised. The age of automat ion demanded equal pay so that men and women could , work together to face its challenge. Welcome The reception, arranged by the Women's Committees of the AEU, WW, Miners' and BWIU, was attended by rep resentatives of some 20 trade unions. Mr. Ralph Marsh, Assistant- Secretary of the NS Labor Council, in proposing a toast of welcome to Miss Harrison and the New Zealand delegates, said that the Australian trade union ' movement was glad to greet overseas visitors.
