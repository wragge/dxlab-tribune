 Milkos protest scabs gYDNEY: A further stoppage of 300 workers at Dairy Farmers' Harris Street plant took place last week in protest against staff men acting as "strike breakers." Over 1000 employees of Dairy Farmers Ltd in Sydney, Newcastle, Wollongong, Bathurst and Moss Vale held a 24-hour strike the previous week in support of a $6 a week wage increase. The stoppage was called by the NSW Labor Council following unsuccessful negotiations with the company. A strike meeting of 600 workers from 18 unions (pictured) at the Sydney Trades Hall decided to back the claim with further stoppages to be determined by the union stewards committees on the job. Apart from the wage demand the unions are demanding that the company officially recognise the job committees. The original claim for wage increases began about two years ago. Last week the Harris Street workers objected to clerical staff (non-union members) operating bottling plants and loading trucks during the strike. They demanded that these workers join the Clerks' Union within seven days or further action would be taken.
