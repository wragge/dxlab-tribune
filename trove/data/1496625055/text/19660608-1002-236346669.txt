 WA clerks' vote rebuffs officials jpERTH: A motion that recommended lifting of last year's expulsion of five prominent militants was carried, it is understood, by 101 votes to 48 at the annual meeting of the rightwing-dominated WA Federated Clerks' Union in Perth on May 31. The meeting refused to re ceive the minutes of the un ion's last annual meeting, and is understood to have rejected the balance sheet and called for the dismissal of the aud itor. During a debate on the min utes submitted by union sec retary and leading DLP mem ber W. R. Sawyer, some mem bers claimed that they were not an accurate record. The five expelled members waited outside the meeting but were not permitted to enter by the executive. At the 1965 annual meeting, the secretary of the Fremantle tally clerks' section of the un ion, Mr. A. G. Nash, claimed that there was a shortage of about $10/300 in the union's assets. The $10,000 had been written off as non-collectable union dues. Though Mr. Nash and four other union members who had led the fight to clean up long- festering sores in this union had the overwhelming support of those present at the 1965 meeting, which elected them after Sawyer & Co. had fled, they were later expelled by the executive on a nonsensi cal charge of "masquerading as union officials". Mr. Sawyer described the meeting which had . elected them as "improperly consti tuted". Mr. Nash then unsuccessfully applied to the Industrial Com mission to have the union de- registered. . In February of thes year the Fremantle tally clerks' section re-elected Mr. Nash as secre tary — a demonstration of con fidence in his leadership. After last week's meeting Mr. Sawyer airily brushed its de cisions aside on the grounds that the annual general meet ing "had no power other than to make recommendations to the union's State executive and State council"— an exposure of the lack of democracy in the present set-up.
