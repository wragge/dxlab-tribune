 [?] TELL MINISTER JYDNEY i A mass strike meeting of 2,000 Sydney Country Council workers last Friday condemned the interference by the State Minister for Local Government and Highways (Mr. Morton) in their wage negotiations. About 4,000 workers held a 24- hour strike in protest against this interference and in support of a service increment scheme of $1.65 for first year, $3.30 Cor second and $4.95 for the third year of service. Following several negotiations between the County Council's negotiating officers and the unions a report was submit ted to a recent meeting of the council. The general manager, Mr. Washington, recomme n d e d against the claim stating it would result in a trading def icit which could only be res olved by increasing electricity charges. The council by the , majority decision directed the general manager to confer further with the unions. A conference took place at which a letter was read from Mr. Morton warning the council of the consequences of granting an increase. The Labor-controlled Council last Monday strongly attacked the Minister for his interfer ence and decided that further talks be held with the unions. Workers claim that big elec tricity concessions are given to big business to the detri ment of workers' wages. . Mr. J. Duckei 'NSW Labor Council organiser told last Friday's strike meeting that over the past 10 years the average price unit of electricity retained throughout the State has dropped from 2.17c per unit to 1.948c per unit. Mr. Ducker was quoting from ah address by Mr. Morton to the annual conference of the Local Government Electricity Association held last month in Wollongong where he said: "There could be no more dramatic demonstration of the advantages to be gained from large scale power station gen eration and bulk supply trans mission to distributing author ities." What the workers are dem anding is for some of these "advantages" to flow to their pay envelopes.
