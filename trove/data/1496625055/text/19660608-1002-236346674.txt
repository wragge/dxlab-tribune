 Visitor from Down South BRIGHT, cheery face appeared around my door this morning— Dave Clark, from Melbourne. Dave is a long distance run ner and came to Sydney to run in the Waterside Workers' Federation Hungry Mile race. Dave ran second. The race was held last Thursday from Circular Quay (near our coat- hanger) down Sussex Street (the "Hungry Mile") to the WWF Sydney office. Dave is very interested in children and children's organi sations; I'm sure that a num ber of our Melbourne readers know him well. We'll have to ask him to tell iic his traininor rniitinn. — DINEWAN.
