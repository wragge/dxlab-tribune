 "Special" warfare 'JpHE establishment of "the first brothel quarter built exclusively for American sol diers in Vietnam" has been an nounced by Time Magazine. It is located at An Khe in the Central Highlands of South Vietnam and is called the An Khe Plaza. "Half-finished, it is a 25-acre sprawl of 'boum-boum parlors' built of concrete blocks and sur rounded by coils of concertina barbed wire," says Time, in its issue of May 6. "Eventually there will be 40 parlors bearing such rubrics as Paradise, Caravelle, Golden Hind and the Moderate Tea room." Vietnamese girls who want to work in the brothel quarter, un officially called Disneyland, have to get a permit and visit the clinic once a week for medical examination and an injection of US-provided penicillin to sup press disease. A US colonel told Time: "We want to get the greatest good for our men with the least harm". He said nothing about the good of the Vietnamese girls.
