 POETRY NOW IN his introduction to "Vietnam Neighbours", his latest collection of verse, Len Fox says: "I had hoped to base my next booklet of poems on the Australian tradition, but events in Vietnam have been so tragic, and of such importance to Australians, that I feel I had to attempt to say something about this Asian country where my wife and I lived for two years in 1956-7 ..." Our descendants in the future world If there is any world left for them Trying to understand our times May not turn to books of poems, Preferring to find our days ' reality In headlines, captions in the daily papers : Village razed . . . Napalm bombs on school ... Prisoner tortured . . . Stocks of foodstuffs burned . . . Women blindfolded . . . Boy taken for questioning . . Dam bombed . . . Growing flood of refugees ... Houses set fire to . . . Gas used on mass scale ..." Archbishop says we're winning Vietnam war Here they may discover a strange poetry , The real and tragic poetry of our times Â» (Reprinted from ''Neighbouring Vietnam", by Len Fox.
