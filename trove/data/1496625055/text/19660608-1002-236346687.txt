 "Wharfies are a terrific bunch" JJYDNEY : Former Australian Olympic star Betty Cuthbert said on Sydney's waterfront last week: "I think wharfies are a terrific bunch of fellas." Betty was one of a number of sports leaders who were full of praise for Sydney water s i d e workers who last week collected almost $800 for the Jamaican Games ap peal. She said that if it were not for those who had donated in the past she, herself, would never have been able to represent Australia. On the initiative of the Waterside Workers' Fede ration Youth Committee, a "Hungry Mile" footrace and other events were or ganised to raise finance to send Australian sportsmen and women to Jamaica for the Commonwealth Games (see story Page 12) . The "Hungry Mile" is the name given to a sec tion of Sussex Street, Syd ney, along which unem ployed waterside workers once trudged , looking for work. A large crowd lined Sus sex Street to cheer the waterside workers who took part in the running and walking events. "BLOODY FINE" When presented with $750 at a social function following the races, Mr. Arthur Tunstall (secre tary-treasurer of the ap peals committee and the assistant manager of the Jamaica team) said: "Don't let me hear any body . criticising wharfies. "All you seem to hear in the daily press is that they go on strike. "But I will tell the press and people in Jamaica what Australian wharfies are really, like. "As an Australian I would say they are a bloody fine lot of blokes." Mrs. Doris McGee (na tional secretary of the Women's Amateur Ath letic Union of Australia) said it was wonderful to get support from trade unionists. "After all , the athletes in the main are workers, so congratulations to the waterside workers for their initiative," she said.
