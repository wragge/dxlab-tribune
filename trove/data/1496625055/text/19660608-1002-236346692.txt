 TU's say train more youth MELBOURNE: A con ference of trade unions held here last week rejected the Federal Government's adult train- ing scheme. The conference, called by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, said the unions do not agree that there is . a serious and acute shortage of trades men. "Where shortages may exist, these have resulted from the failure of the employers, both Government and private, to train apprentices in ' adequate numbers," the unions said. This situation can be readily corrected by; increasing the number of apprentices within these establishments; utilising the additional scope for train ing apprentices as agreed upon between the unions and em ployers in 1962: and by bring ing back to the industry ex perienced skilled tradesmen. Apprentices Ample evidence is available to show that a ' large., percen tage of employers train few or no apprentices. The Government's scheme provided for the training of adults under 25 years of age ' for a period of six months at a technical college. The basic wage would be paid while at college and the tradesmen's rates paid during a further 2i years of workshop training. It also relegates the appren ticeship system to a position of minor importance leading Inevitably to its elimination. "It is therefore objectionable and has caused considerable public concern and industrial discontent", the unions said The unions have proposed that a -tripartite committee be set up to review the appren ticeship system and recommend alterations and corrections de signed to strengthen the sys tem. To help induce youth into the trades there should also be a reassessment of wage rates and conditions.
