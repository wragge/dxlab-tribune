 THE ETHICS OF BIG BUSINESS Jptteu to t&e Sdetox IT is reported in the Sydney Morning Herald (May 26) that G. E. Crane has provisionally agreed to buy Australian factors Ltd. paid capital for a sum calculated at 16.67c in the dollar (3/4 in the pound) on losses formerly disclosed by the factoring company after the date of purchase. This deal has to have the approval of the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court. The money received from the Sale will be divided among the shareholders, debenture holders and the unsecured Creditors. While this may be presented as giving some return on capital hopelessly lost in the collapse of Australian Fac tors, there is no altruism in the actions of G. E. Crane. It is estimated hy the Herald's Financial editor that this takeover of the taxation losess will create a tax sav ing to G. E. Crane of $1,150,000. The cost of the takeover Will be in the vicinity of $450,000 leaving a net profit on the deal of about $700,000. Out of the travail and losses Of the investors in Australian Factors, G. E. Crane will make a handsome profit and at the same time Australian Govern ment revenue will be over $lm. worse off. A similar proposition is be ing advanced for H. G. Palmer where the huge potential losses amount to $25m. (market value possibily worth $4m). The whole thing, gives the lie to any claim that ethics operate in business, especially big business, or in those daily newspapers that appear to approve this discovery of a loophole in the recently re vised Taxation Act This sort of deal is referred to as a success story â€” there is no doubt that Australian workers have another and more correct word for it.
