 Dr. Zhivago. Â¥ READ with interest your review of the Pasternak film "Dr. Zhivago". Your reviewer asks "What would Pasternak have thought of this film, had he lived?" Anyone who wrote the kind of anti-Soviet criticism that Pasternak wrote could scarce ly be naive enough to expect the capitalist world to treat his maudlin sentimentality in any other way than it has been treated. Surely his sister should know better also than to ex pect anything other than "ex ploitation" of his name and his novel. Gwladys Bird, Kew, Victoria.
