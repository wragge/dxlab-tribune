 Big hand for more Shaw pETER O'SHAUGHNESSY as Bernard Shaw on Love and War (showing at the Q Theatre, AMP building, Circular Quay, Sydney) is due to go off very soon, but should be back for a return season. When I went on Friday (lunch-hour) it was stacked to the doors with an audience that warmly responded to Shaw's humorous but terribly biting attacks on imperialism and anti-Communism. Actor Peter O'Shaughnessy gave a performance that made you wonder whether Shaw himself could have been any better. He described and incited the British Black and Tan war on Ireland in terms just made for today's US war on Vietnam. Asking himself was he a Communist or Bolshevik he said: "Of course I am" — so, he said, was every civillised person in some degree. He smiled at the Americans who had entered the first world war to extend their own sort of social and polit ical system and got — instead —the USSR. The middle-class audience- clerks, typists and junior ex ecutives—enjoyed every word. Encore! Critic, Sydney.
