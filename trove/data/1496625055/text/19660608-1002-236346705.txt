 TO UNITE TRANSPORT gYDNEY: Land transport unions are considering a move to establish a Nat ional Transport Federation to strengthen union opposi tion to the replacement of workers through automa tion and mechanisation. Mr. M. O'Brien, federal secretary of the Australian Railway Union, said the move has been initiated to . get greater cooperation and coordination among unions because of the change in the structure of transport. "Automation and mech anisation can and will dis- , place labor in all sections of the transport industry . unless prompt action is taken. 'We cannot ignore the recent Government spon- sored conference on con- tainerisation of cargo," he- said. Mr. O'Brien said that unless prompt action is taken, Australia's transport will be completely subject ed to the dictates and con trol of the international shipping cartels and the monopoly oil interests. The unions that are ex pected to support such a federation include the ARU, the Transport Workers' Union, the Tramways Un ion and the Federated Locomotive Enginemen. A federation of these un ions, embracing over 200,000 workers, would be come one of the most powerful industrial bodies in Australia.
