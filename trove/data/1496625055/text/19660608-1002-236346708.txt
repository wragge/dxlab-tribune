 I Strikes roll on W.A. goldfield PERTH : A packed meeting of the mining division of the Aust. Workers' Union at Boulder on Sunday voted for rolling strikes until the Chamber of Mines agrees to productivity bonuses for all members. The mining section of the AWU is claiming $1 per shift productivity bonus for 2,000. miners. The pro posal for strike action on- May 2 .was postponed to June 5 to evaluate alternative proposals for more piece work and incentive pay from the Chamber of Mines. While goldmining members of the AWU fight . to improve their pay and conditions, discontent is so great that labour turnover on some goldmines has reached a record of more than 100 per cent a year. This was revealed by the president of the Chamber of Mines of WA, Mr. L. E. Elvey, in his annual report to the chamber. He shed a tear or two over the failure of their scheme to employ suitable Italian 'miners in the goldmines be cause the "onerous conditions" imposed by the Italian Government could not be accepted. In fact, the Italian Government sought guarantees of pay and amenities which the goldmining companies think are too good for Italian (or Australian) workers.
