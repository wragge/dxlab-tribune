 8« Ballet beauty Glazunov. It is a welcome choice to add to the widening reper toire of the Company, one which gives plenty of scope for the. Corps de Ballet as well as the principal dancers. From the time the curtain goes up on Act 1 to the closing curtain of Act III there is something to delight, whether it is the sets, costumes, music or the very imaginative chore ography. This is a ballet with very little padding out, there are few moments of waiting for something new to happen. In fact one sometimes finds it hard to assimilate all aspects, there seems to be so much beauty. The blending of exquisite but simple sets, rich costumes and intricate choreography makes for an exciting evening,, one which shouldn't be missed. Garth Welch . and Marilyn Jones danced the difficult leading roles beautifully and were supported by at least eigfrt otheij soloists of very high standard. When one notes that there were another four principals who were not in the program it seems that the basis has well and truly been laid for a healthy, national company. Its permanency will depend on support from audiences and if the reaction by last night's audience can be used as a measuring stick, the now two year old company is here to stay. Much credit must go to Miss Peggy Van Praagh and Robert Helpmann, who are Joint Art istic Directors. Mr. Helpmann's devotion to the development of ballet in this country and his confidence in our own dancers could well be emulated by established figures in other artistic fields. "Raymonda'" will be playing until June 21st, followed by "Pineapple Poll" and a new production of "Giselle" . until June 30th. The final program will be three modern ballets, "Illyria" "Elektra" and "The Lady and the Fool" which con cludes on July 16th. There is enough, in these dance programs to satisfy the most demanding taste.— MkA.
