 Too many strings to I WA metal margins rise I pERTH: A recent Metal Trades award in Western Australia gave trades- | men in- the metal industry a long overdue but nevertheless welcome M margins increase. 11 But a careful look between the lines of the Commissioner's detailed decision leaves a few disturbmg .thoughts. For . in- 1 stance: © Although a claim was made for other metal workers the argument and inspections of work were directed almost sole ly to tradesmen. Only trades men received an increase. O The case was argued and the decision made on "work value". Most if not all of the arguments accepted as support ing the claim for tradesmen ap plied also to non-tradesmen. O The unions announced they did not intend to seek by other means rates higher than those awarded by the Commissioner and also agreed that over-award payments, should be absorbed in the increase. The Commissioner warned that he would amend the award to make it illegal for employ ers to pay rates in excess of the award if any of the unions did not honour the above under takings. The sole ground for increas ing the tradesmen's margin was that margins for other workers had increased to a greater extent over a period of time than had the trades men's margin. Examples of this, as quoted by the unions, were increased margins over a period of time and mainly during the last 12 months for bus drivers, trans port workers, W.A. Public Ser vants, shipping clerks in Can berra, road plant drivers and parking inspectors. The unions also drew atten tion to press reports , which claimed a greater percentage increase in margins for water side workers than for trades men over a period of time. Use of increases in other awards is a new .and novel way of assessing "work values" but the Commissioner gives this method his full backing. Use of this method by a wage fixing tribunal will intrigue union leaders concerned with margins in the main Federal awards covering manual work ers. The Commissioner advances the view that amongst the fac tors entering into an evaluation of work values is the circum stances in which the work is performed and these circum stances, he says "extend beyond the immediate environs of the factory and include the whole context of standards and values in the community to which the workers belong." Workers in general will agree that this is a sound proposi tion. They will also agree that workers engaged in . production processes are entitled to retain the relative value of their wage rates when compared with other occupations of lesser im- M portance in production. l| But the Commissioner having |g adopted this view and granted Is a $4.30 increase to tradesmen - |jg on the basis of it provokes two ; ||| important queries: , |j| © Why adopt this view ana J| stop at . increasing tradesmen s $j| rates only?
