 11$ backs Castro kill ' plot EW YORK: Exposure of the recent plot to assas sinate Cuban premier Fidel Castro by renegade agents of Washington underscores the seriousness of the provocative actions of the US military from its base at Guantanamo base in Cuba. On May 30 it was revealed by the Cuban Government that a speed-boat which had start ed from Miami, USA, had been intercepted five miles west of Havana by the Cuban Navy. The Miami headquarters of the plotters, financed by Washington, last Monday ad mitted that the boat and its occupants had been sent out from Florida. This latest action came on the heels of the shooting down of a Cuban soldier guard on the Cuban side of the border with the Guantanamo base, which is occupied by the US against the wishes of the Cub an nation. Washington has ad mitted that US soldiers killed the Cuban guard and that there have been at least 11 in cidents along the Guantanamo border since last March. All this is happening only five years after the US organ ised the unsuccessful Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba. The New York Times has now admitted that, on the in sistence of the Administration it had suppressed, or toned down reports of the plans for that invasion which, had they been published as received, might have prevented it, thus saving the US from a disaster. After the failure, says the Times, President Kennedy said he wished the Times had pub lished the reports in full.
