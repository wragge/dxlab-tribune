 Landlord and rates T HEARTILY disagree with the proposed $10 poll tax and agree with Tribune that it would be another slug for the worker to bear. I see the imposition of such a tax as a "way out" for maladministration of many councils and a further boost' for big business. If such a tax was. imposed the State Government could .adjust its levies on councils to a higher scale, thus, eating up the increased revenue. Then the Federal Govern ment could reduce its contri butions to the States and use the additional monies gained for further dangerous adven tures in the South-East Asian regions. As I see it councils must levy big business and land- lords higher rates.
