 Voice from a golden age WE often hear that period, when opera house and concert hall rang to the songs of Caruso, Melba and McCormack, described as the golden age of the voice. The scratchy inadequate record ings that remain of these voices make such embarrassing hearing that we must say they are lost to us forever, but today we can hear such a renaissance of the first tra ditions of vocal art and such voices that we may well say that we are experiencing a new golden age of song. If this is so then the art of Soviet singer Zara Dolukhanova— People's Artiste of the Armenian Republic and Lenin Prize winner — must be regarded as the purest gold. She made her bow to Sydney audiences as soloist with the Syd ney Symphony Orchestra under its musical director Dean Dixon, in the Sydney Town Hall on Satur day with the performance of three of Verdi's best known operatic arias. These arias are in Verdi's grand est manner and present in musical dramatic terms the tragic outcome of impassioned love in the lives of three such differing heroines as Aida the Ethiopian princess, slave to the Egyptians; Princess Eboli of the Spanish court of King Phil lip II, and Shakespeare's Des- demona. Dolukhanova presented these , arias with a polished elegance of style, expressive tone and precise musical phrasing, and if her inter pretations seemed a little restrain ed, no doubt this is more suited to the concert platform, than the more dramatic demands of the operatic stage. Her first achievement was the plaintive "Willow Song" where Desdemona oppressed with the premonition of tragedy, sings to her maid a haunting folk song learned from her mother in child hood. ' Dolukhanova's voice is of remark able range and timbre, — she sings both contralto and soprano roles — and we look forward to her re turn when her recitals on July 2 and 4 with Soviet pianist Nina Svetlanova will include much of the music of her native Russia.— H.
