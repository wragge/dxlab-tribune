 BE ATLE HAIRCUT DANGERS ARE NOT REALLY NEW Jetted I OTifflWttuiaag . U tk 1 igpHHiSi Iff HBi I f If "HE action taken by the New South W ales State Govern ment to . have youths with long hair work ing in factories or wherever machines operate, wear hair nets is wise. , In 1919 a similar fashion of long "bobbed" hair prevailed. I was working on a vertical drill (bench size), whilst operating my hair fell forward and was caught by the revolving shaft. I had a bald patch two inches wide extending to the rear top of my skull. My luck was in, I was not scalped, but I was worried for weeks wond ering whether new hair would grow. It did! A more distressing ac- cident happened to a young woman who was a capstan lathe operator â€” she was the factory's most beautiful girl, 19 years old. She wore a sort of cap . with wisps of tresses frilling her face, a re volving rod of metal caught a few wisps of hair and the girl was en tirely .scalped. She died a few years later in hos pital. "Safety guards" were not enforced on factory owners then. W.G.D., Warragamba, N.S.W.
