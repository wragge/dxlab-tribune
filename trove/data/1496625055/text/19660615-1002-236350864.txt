 ALP stays firm in SA DELAIDE: — The A.L.P. Convention in South Aus tralia last weekend has re soundingly condemned the Fed- eral Government on the Viet nam and conscription issues, has shown confidence in the possibility of defeating the Holt Government and has re buffed those who seek to mis use the issue of State aid for education for opportunist ends. In addressing Convention the leader of the A.L.P., Mr. Cal- well, re-affirmed the intention of the Party to contest the com ing Federal elections on the main issues of defence and for eign policy, "the undeclared war in Vietnam and the related evil of conscription of Austra lian youth"., The resolution on these ques tions was carried with one dis senting voice, whose "one-out" statements were seized on by the press to give an entirely er roneous impression of the feel ing of Convention delegates. The resolution stated- that "the Government had neither the right nor the authority to impose military conscription for overseas service on our youth for the purpose of assisting foreign countries in their mili- — tary adventures." It went on to brand Ky as a dictator and declared that Labor Party initiative should be. used ' to take the .Vietnam problem to the United Nations. Strong attempts were made to alter the recent decisions of the National Advisory Commit tee on Education. This took the form of seeking to amend the Committee's report to allow the , question of benefits to non- State schools to be decided by individual states. During a spirited debate the supporters of the Federal deci sion pin-pointed the real issue as the failure of the Federal Government to make finance available for education. The Convention endorsed the Education Committee's propos al by a majority of 97 to 65 in' defeating the amendment mov ed by D. Dunstan— the S.A. At torney-General. The remaining items of the Education report were carried unanimously.
