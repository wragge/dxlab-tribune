 Maritime full steam ahead By Gloria Sanderson THE only change in votes this week is from Paddy King. His energetic team turned in another $18.39, taking him fur ther ahead. However, we've heard 'that in Newcastle the usual "favourite" is just about to chalk up a score. A late report from South Australia says that Lorraine Loyden is now flying the Sema phore flag in place of Jimmy Donaghy. A question has been asked about whether popular seller candidates who receive dona tions from customers can claim these amounts as cent votes. They certainly :can! This is a sure indication of a "popular" sellerâ€” one whose customers give cash support to the paper. In fact, popular seller can didates are in a good position to ask Tribune customers for money to help their campaign for votes. Money intended for votes should be sent to Trib une Popular Seller Competition, giving the name of the candi date for whom it's meant.
