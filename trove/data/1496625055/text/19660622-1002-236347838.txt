 Backing from Sydney workers Last week in Sydney, over 200 maritime workers at a meeting outside the wharf at No., ll WaLsh Bay congratu- lated the British seamen for their stand against "the wealthy British shipping com panies". A resolution of-. support, to be cabled to the British sea men, was carried by the demon strators against the conscrip-.. tion of the "Jeparit" crew to the Vietnam war zone. "The high freight rates these companies charge on Austra lian imports and exports have, been bleeding this country dry", the meeting said.
