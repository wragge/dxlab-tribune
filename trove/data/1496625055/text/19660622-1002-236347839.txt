 Aspac upsets Asia From Rupert Lockwood fpHE Seoul Foreign Ministers' Conference which Austra lia attended is described by Pravda as "a new and dan- gerous plot against the peo ples of Asia and the Pacific." Pravda also saw Seoul as a step: towards clearing /the road for Japan's entry into an ag gressive Pacific bloc. A leading Japanese conser- vative paper, "Nihon Keizai", said the purpose of the con ference was to create a power ful anti-Communist alliance in the a.rea of Asia and the Paci fic". Seoul is generally expected to lead to further escalation of America's South-East Asian war and recruitment of addi tional satellite battalions. The Canberra, ANZUS and SEATO meetings will further develop the Seoul policies. The Burmese newspaper VBotataun" declares that the Seoul meeting is regarded as a United States attempt to re cruit new allies in Asia and "thus expand its military gambles against socialist coun tries and the national libera tion movement and to exert pressure on neutral countries." This is why the people in Asia object to the Seoul meet ing in the name of peace in Asia and throughout the world, the newspaper adds.
