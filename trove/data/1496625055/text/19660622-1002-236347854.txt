 Jeparit 's for peace, too gYDNEY: Seamen Union crewmen of the "Jeparit" last Thursday in Sydney joined with 200 other sea- I men, wharfies and other un ionists in a protest demon stration against the Holt Government's Vietnam pol icy. This was outside the Walsh Bay wharf where the "Jeparit" was loading war supplies for Vietnam. New Zealand seamen from two ships unloading joined in. Like their brother union ists on the "Boonaroo" (now somewhere in the war zone) the men on the "Jeparit" have decided to make the vessel a "peace ship," in reply to the Government's use of the Australian Nation al Line to conscript civilians into to the war. Ken Hall, a Jeparit crew member and father of three young girls, told Tribune a meeting of the 18 Seamen's Union members that morn ing had unanimously formed a committee to send back first hand information to Australia.

George Jenkins, the union delegate and father of two t young children, said: "The whole crew believes that Australian servicemen 8 should be in Australia, not I in other countries fighting I people struggling for inde- I pendence." 8 He said the crew had sign- I ed on under protest, "not 8 against the Australian ser- 8 vicemen but against Holt's 8 policy which has forced 1 these lads, including con- | scripts, into the rotten 8 war." 8 Bob Frew, a delegate and 8 father of three, said: "All of us would rather be going to bring our boys back."
