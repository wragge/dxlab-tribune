 I GUN ATTACK ON CALWELL I"pHE dastardly shooting attack on Labor Leader Arthur Calwell at Mosman on Tuesday night !has alerted the Australian people to the dangerous effects of the militarist situation into which this country has been plunged. Mr. Calwell had just dej- livered a powerful speech of condemnation of the Holt Government's brutal Vietnam war and conscrip tion policies, before a big audience. This was typical of his -leading part in this ca?paign, vital to Aus tralia's future and to the coming elections. The political forces behind the gunman must be publicly investigated and exposed. Whatever the personal motives of the individual behind the gun, this resort to armed violence to meet political issues is a direct outcome of the cam paign of incitement to violence conducted in re cent months by sections of the daily press, certain military officers and prac tised by ultra right groups. These groups have been working up their dis ruption of peace demon strations and have con- centrated attention on meetings on Sydney's North Shore, including Mosman. The attempt to assassinate Mr. Calwell as he left in his car (he suffered facial injur ies) indirectly reflected the in creasing desperation of the pro-Government forces, faced with steadily growing mass public opposition to Australian involvement in the Vietnam war. It must be seen as a warn ing that Australian democracy —fortunately free of any tra dition of political assassinations in the American style— will come under increasing attack' in coming months. The whole labor and demo cratic movement must rally its forces in a united campaign that will sweep the militarist and repressive government and its policies out, and orient Aus tralia to peaceful and con structive development.
