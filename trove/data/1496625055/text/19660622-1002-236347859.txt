 Two poems on Vietnam Memento Mori A shell explodes And my back grows spikes. Barbed wire catches my clothes As J see my rice field disappear Above my eyes. My face becomes muddy. The sound of jets fills the air As the water about me boils And my skin- turns black. Bullets splinter the wall of my hut and my childrens' eyes Reflect twenty years of fighting. : f II My train pulls into St. James. Something splits 'through the window glass â€” peoples' faces this time. , I am not Vietnamese or a soldier But why then are there deaths on my mind? B. Searle.
