 [?] Hot tin that paid off I By "Pegasus" I |N Tribune's May 4 issue I suggested that it would pay to follow the New 3 Zealand galloper Apa (by Gabador from Kings Lady). . I| My faith in tipping Apa has been fully vindicated, for out of his last four races, he's had two wins and a third. He won the Moreton Han dicap run over 104 fur longs, and then went on to win the rich Brisbane Cup , run over 2 miles with his new race jockey Darby McCarthy, on top. Apa's starting price in the Moreton Handicap was 7/1 and a very generous 13/2 in the Brisbane Cup. Apa has at last reproduc ed his true form on the Brisbane turf, form which- enabled him to win the Auckland Cup (2 miles) early in the year. His con nections have now aimed him for the Doomben Cup, to be run on July 9, and worth $20,000. I think the Doomben Cup run over 11 furlongs might be too short a distance for I Apa for he's always shown I his best from over 2 miles. But I would not rule him out of calculations at the moment, particularly as he has taken to the Brisbane turf which is far less spongy than Sydney's. Garcon (by Rawalpindi from Festive Air) trained i by T. J. Smith, was a most impressive winner of the 2-year-old Handicap (7 fur longs) last Saturday at Rosehill (Sydney). Garcon, having his third rim since a spell, finished far too strongly for the second horse, Forest Piper, who was backed in from 100/1 to start at 9/1. More over, as this was only Forest Piper's second race, he must be worth follow- ing. , Garcon's first race since coming back from a spell was an excellent fifth to brilliant 2-year-old Nebo Road; his second after the spell was another good ef fort: he finished sixth be hind Matariki, an equally brilliant 2-year-old. And so I feel that the form from Garcon's first race will work out ex tremely well and he should be coupled with Forrest Piper, as two sure winners for the near future. I New Era In League By The Challenger |AST Sunday's rugby league match at Sydney Cricket Ground when the Balmain > "Tigers" mauled the "Saints" of St.' George to take out a 1.0-3 decision, ushered in a new era in Sydney rugby league football. It was an historic occa sion, being the first time in about . 90 years that the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust has opened the ground— Sydney's best— to Sunday sport. Of over 125,000 fans who attended all rugby league 1 matches in the Sydney metropolitan area last weekend, 56,000 rallied to the Sunday game at the Sydney Cricket Ground. The previous day at the 4 Sydney Cricket Ground, the N.S.W. team had beat- en the Englishmen before I a crowd of 39,000, so the 4 fibres seem to in I that big-time Sunday M games are here to stay. '-| Test Preparation 1 Or Destruction I Test with I the Englishmen to take H place on Saturday, a ques li tion that should be promin-' J ent m most League fans 8 minds is whether the aZ fl tralian test players can M stand the pace of the pre- H Test build-up. H ®rjflsh half-back Tommy H Bishop pm-pointed this M when he said that he was H pleased it was the Austra- || lians who were "running 11 their hearts out" just one lif ' Te? Prir t0 the First H And not only that, but M the number of injuries be- m mg suffered by the Aussies li on Test eve ckn lead one flj to the conclusion that they M . y most likely crack up if!® instead of reaching their til peak for the big game. tS The Englishmen in their 3 approach to pre-Test games ijp have to a degree exhibited a somewhat artificial "looseness" in their game and a similar attitude to 1 / tackling. This coupled to I the Aussie Team's strenu- | , t ous and somewhat hazard- I i> ous preparations, indicates I ; a win for the Englishmen. Who will win the . .First Test? We can . only assess this from what we have ' seen so far, and evidence v, seems to show that the .Englishmen stand a better than even chance. g|| Sports goods 1 prices fight 1 DERTH: "Tom's 1 , Weekly" quotes || an extract from the || "Australasian Sports- || goods and Toy Re- 1|| tailer" which com- m plains bitterly "T o m the Cheap ||l Grocer's" success in |i| bursting manufactur- ||j ers'. price ring agree- 1|| ments on several lines || of goods. 1| The latter publication || May, 1966, ran an article jg headed "disgraceful devei- g opment in Perth", ana pre- m dieted that "Tom «ie Cheap Grocer" was gome . to be "a real problem w m the trade in Perth."
