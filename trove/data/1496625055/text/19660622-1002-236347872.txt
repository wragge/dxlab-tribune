 COLD WAR ON THE ICE-CREAM SELLER If'-aillsllsil i Letters f to the Editor |F you think it's fun, with plenty of money attached, operating those musical ice-cream vans that roam around the suburbs, think again. The hours are long and the returns are scanty despite the proprietors' alluring advertise ments for labor, as I found recently when I gave it a go for a while. After trying it for one of the companies for a fortnight, I found my return was about $50 for a 70 hour week. In sunimer, I was told, the returns were bigger, but the hours just as long, or longer. The weekends were the best- paying times to operate, but this meant I . saw . little of my family. The big concerns owning the vans don't pay holiday money or provide workers' compensa tion rights. The seller is tech nically not an employee but a contractor. None of the laws drawn up to protect a worker apply to him. He gets a quarter of the value of his gross sales. And then the taxman takes his whack, of. course. You also have to know the local councils' regulations and take the rap\ for any breach of them you may knowingly or otherwise commit. I'd advise anyone who's thinking of taking on a job like that to first of all read the small print on the con tract. Don't just go by the wording of the jobs vacant ad vertisement. The hearts of your new bosses (alias, your partners in your new contract) are colder than the ice-cream you'll be trying sell. "Peter Penguin" (Leichhardt)
