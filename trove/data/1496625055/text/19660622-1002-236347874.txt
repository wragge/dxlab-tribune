 Printers tie up Perth papers pERTH: Printing indus try employees pre vented the publication of newspapers in Perth for two days last week when they took solid and courageous strike action against the powerful news ' combine West ; Australian Newspapers Ltd. Gagged by both press and court, they returned to work under protest in the face of threatened penalties of $1000' against the. union and $100 against each member if they continued. (A mass meeting of 600 mem bers on June 13 had previously unanimously decided to con tinue the strike.) Before the return to work, the "West" was told that any adverse, reporting of the strike would be met with suitable retaliation and its report was suitably restrained. However, the action taken by the W.A. Industrial Commission unanimously directing the un- ion oacK to worn ana savageiy attacking the strikers, strength ened the employers, who re fused to publish the union's resolution and statement. Because of the "West's" octo pus control of the State's only morning and evening news paper, several radio stations, T.V. station, one weekend newspaper and other publica tions, the public had little op portunity to hear the union side.
