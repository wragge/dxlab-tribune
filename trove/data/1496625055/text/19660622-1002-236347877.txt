 Party protests Verwoerd blows C YDNEY : The Communist Party's central com mittee last weekend issued a new challenge to the repressive policies of the South African Government. It condemned the sentencing to life imprisonment by the South African Government of the outstanding Communist and fighter for the people's liber ties, Abram Fischer. "Mr. Fischer ranks with Nelson Mandela, also serving a life sentence, as one of the most distinguished South Afri cans who are now paying the penalty for having served the true interests of their country by fighting against the racist apartheid policy and for a Republic of South Africa based on equal rights for all", it said. "We point out that the apar theid policy stems from the desire of the white monopol ists in South Africa to exploit to the maximum the low-paid labor of Africans which apar theid makes available to them. "We call on the Australian people to join with us in de manding the release of Abram Fischer, Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners in South Africa. "We also call for the lifting of restrictions placed on Mr. Ian Robertson, president of the National Union of South African University Students, for having, in his official capacity, spon sored the recent visit to South Africa of US Senator "Robert Kennedy. "We condemn the restrictions as typical of the attacks on freedom which are part and parcel of the enforcement of the apartheid policy and call on other Australians to add their voice to the demand for the release of these patriots. Protests should be sent to the South African Ambassador, Green Square, Jardine Street, Kingston, Canberra ACT).
