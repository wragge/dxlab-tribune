 Stop sackings or we stop: unions C YDNEY : Building unions have threatened a 24- . hour stoppage of all workers in the Public Works Department unless the NSW Government stops the sackings in the PWD. This was decided by a meet ing of unions last Friday fol lowing the sacking of 19 wor kers and a rumOur that wide spread dismissals are pending. An urgent telegram from the unions to Jthe Minister for Public Works (Mr. Hughes) demanded the reinstatement of the dismissed workers. "No more workers could be dismissed, particularly when your department is letting out Government building contracts to private contractors," the unions said.' Mr. M. McNamara (acting president of the Building Trades Group of unions and secretary of the Builders Lab ourers Union) told last Thurs day's Labor Council that they had heard of another 90 to be dismissed. He said the Minister's sec retary "has the audacity to say that the unions will only be informed if more than 200 are to be dismissed." Mr. McNamara said that a $1 million contract has been given to the contractor, H. W. Thompson, for extensions to the Rydalmere Mental Hospital while PWD workers are being sacked from this site. . Mr. L. Schurr (secretary of the BTG) said this week that lunch-hour meetings of PWD workers are being held to back the unions' call for strike action. He said the Labor Council will be asked to arrange a conference with the Minister as a matter of urgency to de mand a stop to PWD work being handed to private con tractors.
