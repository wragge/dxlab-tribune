 f JUNIOR TRIBUNE 0B0ELLO Junior Tribune readers, Every state in Australia has many wonderful scenic spots. One of the prettiest in New South Wales is very close to Sydney. In fact, it is only 73 miles from Sydney on the Bell Road. It is called Mount Wilson. nauunc wwson is a volcanic mountain and has a rain for est. There are many good walk ing spots to go to — the walks are fairly easy for young and old and the trails are well marked. i : The walk that i like the best is down to and through the rain forest. You walk down from the usual lovely gums and shrubs towards a little waterfall and as you descend mto the rain forest the trees and the undergrowth change. The rocks are wet, the under growth glitters with thousands f little diamonds of dew, and you are surrounded with large and small tree ferns. The gums grow straight and tall, some them so large that four People with outstretched hands cannot reach around the trunk. Moss and other plants attach themselves to the trees and yu stand still and quiet, you can hear the drip, dnp, drip of water and dew. There are so many diff erent greens to be seen, from the delicate light green of the tree ferns to the dark green of the trailing creepers. You can really let your imag ination go and you can see all sorts of animals and creatures in the twisted, tangled roots of the creepers and trees, par ticularly in the section called "The Cathedral of Ferns". Not only does the rain for est offer you this beauty but it is inhabitated by many var ieties of birds. The bell-bird and whip-bird are continuously calling. The day that I walked through the forest I was lucky enough to hear a performance by that wonderful mimic — the lyre bird— no, I didn't see him — perhaps if you go you will be lucky enough to not only to hear him but to see his dance. — -Dinewan.
