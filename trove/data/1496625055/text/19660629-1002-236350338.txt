 Press 'misleading' on Aboriginal strikers' camp ARWIN : "Inaccurate and grossly misleading/' is how the North Australian Workers' Union de scribes recent newspaper reports that the Aborigines who walked off Newcastle Waters Station some months ago, were almost starving at their camp. The Aborigines walked off Newcastle Waters Station last July protesting against an Arbitration Court decision not to grant them equal pay with whites for three years. A report has been accepted by the union from a life mem ber and ex-organiser, Mr. R. F. Antony who made an investig ation of the conditions of the Aborigines camped at Elliott. He was accompanied to Elliott by the Aboriginal organ iser of the union, Mr. Dexter Daniels. The newspaper reports, under the name of Douglas Lock- wood, said that the Aborigines wer being forced to hunt lizards and dig nuts because of a shortage of food. Mr. Antony said that â€”they arrived" at the camp a week after Lockwood's story appeared and there was still food there. Reporting to the union on his investigations, Mr. Antony said: "Anyone who is acquainted with Aborigines knows that no matter how well they may be fed on our foods, they will still dig and hunt for their natural foods. "The 120 people Lockwood is alleged to have found, are a figment of journalistic imagin ation." There are less than 80 people at the camp.
