 [?] Wtih Tribune's Industrial 1 Roundsman yHEN politicians make promises it's some times handy to have it on tape. At least the NSW Public Ser vice Association has found that Premier Askin's address to their ' last conference which was rec orded, might be useful in their wage case before the State In dustrial Commission. An overflow mass meeting of public servants last week con demned the Public Service Board's wage offer and called on the Government to intervene on their behalf. The association is claiming yearly increases from $104 to $1,282 and the Board has only offered $24 to $342. This year some Common wealth public servants received increases ranging from $218 to $282 and Victorian public ser vants $316 to $1,050. On tape Askin said: "The Government's policy is that, generally speaking, the salaries and working conditions for our public servants shall not be be hind other States—in fact, we prefer them to be a bit ahead." Now the Association wants .Askin to back up these words before the Commission. rnHE NSW Labor Council's disputes committee has decided to back the Miscellan eous Workers' Union in its fight with the Public Service Board over contract cleaning of public schools. The Board is called on to remove the contractor (General Contract Cleaning Pty. Ltd.) or a union black ban will be plac ed on the construction and maintenance of the schools in dispute. ? Mum, is that conductress really that flat? No, it's just her jacket, dear- it makes her look like that. Mum, they always seem to wear those crushed, grey blouses, And her skirt has a zipper— just like daddy's trousers. Well, dear, the whole shabby uniform is out of date, Like a lot of buses in this Liberal State. —From a girl who cares.
