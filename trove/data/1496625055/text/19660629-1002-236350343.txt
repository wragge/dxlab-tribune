 De Gaulle's tour step to new agreement? From Rupert Lockwood AAOSCOW: President de Gaulle's triumphant tour of the USSR could well end in an agreement that might change the face of Europe. That seems to be the opin- ion of the most responsible commentators, who also note the impact" which the De Gaulle visit is having on other European nations made restive by Washington dictates. The London Daily Sketch wants to know when Britain is going to follow De Gaulle's example by breaking away from the USA and pursuing an independent policy. The New York Times re ports that De Gaulle assured Soviet leaders that the days of military blocs are num bered. Genevieve Tabouis in the Paris Jour says that all efforts to minimise the international significance of the De Gaulle visit have suffered fiasco. TASS interprets Paris news paper commentators' opinions on the visit thus: "The cold war is a matter for the past at least in Europe and every thing must be done to prevent its, comeback and to exploit the prevailing situation for the establishment of a more last ing equilibrium and peace in Europeâ€” and then all over the world".' Positive Izvestia says the visit sums up positive shifts in relations between the USSR and France arid is the starting point for new advances. New Times sees De Gaulle's mission as . opening up; entirely new prospects for the consoli dation of general security. New Times forecasts that the talks opened in Moscow between De Gaulle and the Soviet leaders "will produce useful results and a substan tial contribution to the cause of strengthening security in Europe." When De Gaulle cried in Russian "Long live Russia!" to conclude his speech of greetings from the French to the Soviet people he perhaps had some enduring arrange ment for European peace in mind as an alternative to the crumbling NATO wstr bloc.
