 Better, but not enough I think everyone will agree that the first number of the Australian Left Review repres ents a vast improvement on the old ; Communist Review, which had long since out lived its usefulness. Its format is much more attractive and compact and its editors give every indicat ion of wanting to tackle vital and controversial topics of concern to all those interested in seeing the development of creative Marxist thought in Australia. At the same , time, it is obvious that there is still room for considerable im provement if the magazine is to fulfil its important role of making Marxism relevant to present-day reality. Greater attention, I think; should be paid in future issues to ensuring that all contributions measure up to the quality necessary for such a venture. In the first issue, it seemed to me that only John Sendy's article on "Dem ocracy and the Communist Party" got anywhere near probing beneath the surface of its subject. Lastly, why is it that when- ever people get into print in Communist publications they are almost invariably deprived of the names their mothers gave them and reduced to the anonymity of a single initial? Such an approach seems to me to be about as Australian as a glass of vodka neat arid a caviar sandwich. Roger Miliiss, (Sydney).
