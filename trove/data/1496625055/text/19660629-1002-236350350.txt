 London won't swallow it "T"HE refusal of the British Government, restated by Foreign Secretary Stewart this week, to send troops to Vietnam even if they are no longer "needed" in Malaysia is highly significant. ihe expected scaling down or British troops in parts of Malaysia, especially North Borneo, evidently means some thousands of "Tommies" will go home. It is all too plain that the British don't believe in or accept the basic American and Australian excuse for their presence in Vietnam — the alleged "southward thrust by Chinese Communism". Other SEATO members, too, have shown their indifference to this story by refusing to take the present SEATO conference seriously. France has only sent an observer. Pakistan this week, as the Sydney Morning Herald complains, is actually preparing to entertain the Chinese premier on a state visit to Pakistan. The British scepticism as to the threat of ,a "Chinese take-over" is the more significant in that they have more at stake in a material sense than anybody else, drawing big annual dividends from their £400 million investment in Malayan tin, rub ber and oil. Mr. Holt, of course, is not in a good position to argue. Only last week Australia sold another en ormous consignment of wheat to China, our fourth biggest trading partner. How can he expect to convince Pakistan, France — and Britain that he really sees this partner as a monster of aggression which is all set to engulf Australia? These are some of the realities behind the diffi culties of the SEATO organisation, which began its conference in Canberra this week already split and contemptuously labelled as a mere "facade" by an important participant, the Thai foreign minister, The tattered excuse of "Chinese aggression" will scarcely rebuild SEATO at this stage, but it remains clear that the US and the Holt governments are un yielding in their determination to use force to extend their grip on Asia and the Pacific. That is the real threat to Australia's future.
