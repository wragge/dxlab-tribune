 In brief . in brief . in brief , 1 \ 1 > TOKYO TO FORE IN ASPAC MOSCOW: Tke Asian Pacific Council (ASPAC) formed at Seoul, where Australia joined America's less re- putable Asian satellites, is described in Pravda as the Pentagon's new-born war pact. ASPAC?s purpose, says Pravda, is "to harness to the same chariot Washington's allies in east Asia and the western Pacific." Pravda describes Japan's attempts at ASPAC to have its members form a bloc at the United Nations as "a man ifestation of the cherished dream of Tokyo's reactionary circles to head the Asian bloc in the international arena." Pravda commentator Olga Chechetkina says: "It is now absolutely obvious that Japan was one of the principial organisers of the Seoul con ference and, in the absence of an official US representa- ive, the Japanese delegate assumed the role of first fiddle at the conference".
