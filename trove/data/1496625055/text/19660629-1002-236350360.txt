 And in j USA- boots! MEW YORK: Last Thurs- 1 day white police at | Canton, Mississippi, at- | tacked Negro and white civil rights marchers with tear gas, truncheons and boots. Police used the excuse that the marchers were allegedly try ing to set up camp in a "prohi bited" school yard. The marchers, mostly negroes, were gassed and then savagely kicked by troopers as they lay j prostrate. Earlier, they had met violence in Philadelphia (Miss.). The Communist Party of the ; USA immediately sent a tele- ; gram to President Johnson, de manding that Federal troops be sent to protect the freedom marchers in Mississippi from , ' attack by white racists. ' J ; The telegram was sent by un- j animous decision of the 18th National Convention of the ! party, then meeting in New 1 York. ; It demanded the sacking of i Attorney General Katzenbach and FBI chief Hoover for con niving at the whites' violence. i i In his report to the Congress, CPUSA chief spokesman Gus j Hall said the correctness of the , j last Congress' decision that the ; !&lt; j Negro civil rights struggle was i political had been confirmed. 4 J Henry Winston, national com- H mittee member, a Negro who i lost his sight while suffering j imprisonment in the US for his ! beliefs, opened the Congress. The 300 delegates included 4 veterans of the US Communist j; movement who have held out j through many years of persecu- ;!; tion and victimisation. See also page 9.
