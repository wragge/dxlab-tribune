 CONGRESS IN UGANDA; DICTURED above is Mme. Jeanne Martin of Mali, one of the leading figures in the struggle being waged by African women for equal rights and a better way of life. And as General Secretary of the permanent Pan-African Women's Congress organisation, she's playing a prominent part in organising a most important gathering for African women in only four week's time. July 24-31 is the date and Kampala, capital of Uganda in East Africa, is the place. If you can make it you'll meet women from 27 African countries— delegates to the 3rd Pan-African Women's Congress. Most of them will be from newly independent nations, but there'll also be representatives from Angola, South Africa and Portuguese Guinea, so there's sure to be a broad range of discussion. It will be a Congress with a difference, though, because it won't all be just talk. There will be technical training courses as well—in cookery, needlework, child care and hygiene. The idea is that all those who attend will then be able in turn to teach members of their local Pan-African Women's Congress branches back home. Just in case you won't be able to go but think the Congress is worth supporting all the same, there is a way you could help. The organisation estimates that costs will run over $20,000 —including delegates' fares and the buying of equipment. Any size donation would help. You could either make it personally or arrange it through your trade union. In either case, please send it to the U.A.W., 64a Druitt St., Sydney, where it will be(.fptwardpd,on. , . v«-w > v
