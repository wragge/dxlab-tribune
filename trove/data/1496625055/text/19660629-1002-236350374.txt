 Peace missions "DEACE" missions to Hanoi sometimes arouse 1 the suspicions of those who know the real source of the Vietnam war, since the keys to that war and its peaceful solution lie in Washington and South Vietnam. This has been emphasised again this week by visiting Saigon foreign minister Tran Van Do, who said that his government would "never negotiate" with the National Liberation Front — the patriotic organisation which controls most of that country despite the force of the US invasion. When Dean Rusk claims the US is "waving the banner of peace" (while brutally escalating the war) he is seeking support in a sceptical and indig nant world. In any case, he means peace with every one except the majority struggling for freedom in Vietnam. Peace missions must see their main ob jective as being to get that position changed, with recognition of the NLF. Thus, while genuine fact-finding missions from the Australian labor movement and other sections to all parts of Vietnam could do nothing but good, Mr. Calwell's reported proposal for a joint parlia mentary peace mission to Hanoi needs careful ex amination. A prime essential, as Mr. Calwell suggests, is ...... discussion of proposals to be made by any such delegation to resolve the Vietnam problem. Such discussion will show that Hanoi is by no means the only — or even the main — -place to be approached. If those proposals centred on a return to the Geneva Agreement and on breaking down the real obstacles to peace, such an initiative could undoubt edly serve a valuable purpose. " " V " " ' "
