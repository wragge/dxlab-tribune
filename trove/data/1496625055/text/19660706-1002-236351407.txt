Soviet- French declaration is on the theme that Presi dent de Gaulle and the Soviet Government arrived at a genuine program of peace which could mark a enw stage in international relations. It could benefit all nations; This comment is supported by many European papers. Before he left, De Gaulle outlined three stages that were being followed: first, relaxation of tension; next, concord; then co-operation. The main points of the joint Soviet-French declaration signed in Moscow were for normalisation of relations between European nations, against proliferation of nuclear weapons, a Vietnam peace on the Geneva terms excluding foreign inter vention, regular and continuing contact between the USSR and France including a direct line between the Kremlin and the Elysee Palace and the launching of a French satellite by the USSR. The French Communist paper Humanite calls the declaration the opening of a new chapter in French-Soviet relations. Soviet leaders L. N. Brezhnev, A. N. Kosygin and N. V. Podgorny accepted De Gaulle's invitation to visit France. The Declaration said both governments agreed that "the problems of Europe should be first of all studied within European limits." The situation in Vietnam, they said, aroused "increasing, alarm because of the aggravation of the war in Vietnam".
