 I m n g o v 1 1" i h" 11 Q 11 g-JELLO Tribune Juniors, This week we have a happy little fellow for you to make as a gift for your school fete. He is simple and quick — here's what you need. a ping pong ball, a little bit of cotton wool, 4 pipe cleaners, scrans of cotton material. paints or textra pencils for drawing on the face and three pieces of the old style egg car ton. You firstly make a hole each side of the egg carton for the arms and legs (see drawing) and knot them on the inside. Glue the two pieces together for the body, then glue the cot ton wool to the top of the ping pong ball for hair (you can colour this to match his clothes). Paint on his face, glue on his hat (you may prefer to cut down the other piece of egg carton if it is too big). Glue the head to the body. Out of strong cardboard cut two hands and feet— glue them to i the pipe cleaners and paint I them black. Your mannikin is now ready to dress. You can either dress him as a clown and Mummy will help you with this, or you may have some other ideas on how to dress him. A little bit of net gathered around his neck and wrists adds the finishing touches to his out fit. Chuckles . . . Teacher: George, what is a synonym? George: A synonym is a word you use when you can't spell the other one. >K V j|&lt; DID you hear about the ab sent minded professor who returned from lunch as saw a sign on his door "Back in 30 minutes" and sat down to wait for himself?
