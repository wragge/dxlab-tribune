 I Poet to the rescue From Rupert Lockwood j JVA O S CO W: Yevgeni I Yevtushenko recited | his poetry for three hours to 10,000 people who paid from one rouble to 2.50 roubles at Moscow's Pal ace of Sports. Yevtushenko was raising money for earthquake-stricken Tash kent which, while he rec ited, rocked to new shocks. Tashkent has now had its fifth seven-point earth quake (a most serious quake measured on the 12 point system) since April 26 last, and some 400 other shakes some of five and six points. Yet people there keep on working in offices, shops and factories and going to cinemas and theatres. The Soviet State unlike private insurance com panies was ready to ex tend home insurance once the quakes began and' private home owners are having their dwellings re placed by substantial state aid. All parts of the USSR are rallying to Tash kent's aid with money, materials and voluntary works teams.
