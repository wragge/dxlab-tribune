 MORE QUESTIONS ON I ABORIGINE'S DEATH I LAST week Tribune published a story exposing the inhuman | treatment associated with the death of an Aborigine in | Griffith, who died manacled in the hack of a police waggon be- tween Griffith and Goulburn on June 20. r ' He was Harold Hampton 36, married. with five children who had. left Griffith Hospital of his own accord the day before his death where he had re ceived. attention for a mental disorder he had suffered with hom the age of 18. He was arrested on the Sunday and returned to the jail, not the hospital, manacled hand, and foot. He died in the police wag- pn while being transported to Gouiburn from Griffith after beng remanded into police custody for psychiatric treat ment. Tribune posed a number of questions that the inquiry into his death would have to answer. There are other questions associated not with the death, but with the life of Harold Hampton that again reveal the callous attitude of the author ities generally to the Abor iginal people. What had the Aborigine Welfare Board done about the living conditions of this men tally ill man and his wife and five children? With other Aborigine famil ies they lived next to the local rubbish . dump in a tent. Last year Hampton served si?: months in Long Bay jail, convicted on similar charges after a mentai breakdown. Why wasn't he sent to hos pital instead of jail and was there anything done about medical treatment before and after his release?
