Signatories We publish below a statement signed by 246 Australian trade union officials , from 46 unions , protesting against the Federal Government's involvement of Australia in the war in Vietnam. "We, the undersigned Union Officers, declare our opposition to the Federal Govern- ment's decision to send conscript troops to Vietnam. "We join with the many leaders of other sections of the community who have opposed Australia's participation in this particularly cruel and undeclared war. "The very serious situation now operating in Vietnam is a matter of grave concern; this conflict could lead to another world war which in today's circumstances would be nuclear war. "We declare that all nations and peoples have the right to self-determination without the threat of force or military oppression. "This right ss being denied to the Vietnamese people who have had Imposed on them a series of military Governments without being given any vote or right of selection of their own Government. "We declare that the flolt-McEwen Government has no mandate for the actions it is undertaking, and challenge it to put the conscription issue to the people by referendum. "We ask all trade unionists, together with all other sections of the people, to join with us in a call on the Federal Government to — Use its influence in bringing about an end to all military aggression in Vietnam; End Australian participation in the inhuman Viet- nam war; Revoke the conscription for overseas service; Act to obtain a peaceful settlement of the Vietnam ! war on the basis of the principles of the 1954 Geneva Accords. '/Our nation needs a policy of peace, trade and friendship with our Asian neighbours. "This requires action by Governments to withdraw all troops and take positive steps to seek a peaceful solution by negotiation through the United Nations Organisation." In making the declaration, the union leaders call on all trade unionists to support their protest to the Federal Government against its commitment of "our Nation and our people to this cruel and undeclared War".
