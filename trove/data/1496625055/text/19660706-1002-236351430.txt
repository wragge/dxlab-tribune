 Care of the aged pHE Federal Government's decision and instructions to NSW general practitioners to keep non-nursing cases out of nursing homes has come as a shock to most social workers and people interested in the welfare of the aged. The Federal Government at present pays a subsidy of $2 a day for these patients, and no doubt wants to save a few dollars at the expense of the elderly people; there is no question about the amount of dollars squandered in the un just war against the Vietnam people. Surely the Federal Lib eral Government is reaching an all-time low when they have to pinch dollars in this fashion. According to a report in the Sun-Herald, 19/6/66, 3,500 eld erly people will be affected; the report says, in short, that these people have been told by the Federal Government to find another home. A lot of good people inter ested in the care of our aged have from time to time put for ward sound propositions to both the State and Federal Governments, but like other social matters all of these de pend on finance. And when it comes to finance the Fed eral Government holds the purse strings and is more interested in interfering in the affairs of other countries than providing for the care of their own peo ple. As a positive contribution for the care of the aged, the Red- fern-Waterloo Communist Party branch proposed to the Federal that it subsidise the State Gov ernment $4 to $2 (as they do charitable institutions) to con struct in the Redfern-Waterloo area a block of 100 flatettes, with welfare and medical cen tres attached. We backed our application with 1800 signa tures from residents of the area. In the meantime the subsidy to nursing homes does provide some relief for our aged people. I am afraid that my protest to the Federal Government is going to be sharp and to the point. Jim Sharrock, (Red fern).
