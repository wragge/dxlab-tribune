 Seamen condemn Ca Swell attack ADELAIDE: the at- tempt to murder the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Calwell) "stems directly from the war hysteria whipped up by the Holt Government, the DLP and other forces who have com mitted Australia to ad- venturous war policies in Vietnam and South East Asia". The statement was made by seamen at their stopwork meeting at Port Adelaide last week. The seamen continued: "The prevailing climate of politics in Australia, with American type violence, i,s a result of the slavish following of US directed foreign policies. We pledge to redouble our efforts to unite all sections of the Labor movement to bring down the Holt Govern ment this year as a step to wards developing an indepen dent Australian policy and way of life". Other SA protests have come from the Labor Party and the Waterside Workers' Federation.
