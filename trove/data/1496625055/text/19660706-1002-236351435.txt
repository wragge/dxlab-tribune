 Bonanza out of the boom rpHEY gave their lives for the cause, is the title of a book let which came into my hands recently. It contains several case histories of communists and other progressives in coun tries such as Spain, Iraq, Por tugal, Greece, Czechoslovakia and Lebanon who suffered and died at the hands of the fas cists. I shall quote a short excerpt from this excellent little book: "I hate imperialism with a passionate hatred, and I shall fight it until my last breath. I want everyone to fight for the end of that monster which fattens on the tears and suf fering of the millions. . . "Glory to communism, that all-powerful universal idea in the name of whose triumph thousands of heroes, men and women, are ready to face every trial ! . "Glory to those men and women who have perished in a noble cause, whose courage and staunchness have demonstrated the grandeur of their principles, whose struggle and sacrifice have stripped the mask froro the face of imperialism ana its base servitors and lighted the way to the victorious future.
