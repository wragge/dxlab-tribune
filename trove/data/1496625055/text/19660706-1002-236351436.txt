 War against civilians C YDNEY : The US raids on Hanoi and Haiphong last week would certainly have been accom panied by extensive civilian casualties. This was stated by a former Sydney headmaster, Mr. W. E. Gollan, who was in Vietnam in the second half of the last year. He was a member of the World Peace Council delegation which visited Hanoi to discuss the question of ending the war with Vietnamese government and peace organisation leaders. Mr. Gollan said that while in Vietnam he saw an American air raid and noted that the heavy ground defence forced the bombers to unload their bombs at a very high altitude. From this experience he would say that precision bombing was impossible and last week's raids on oil storage tanks "would certainly have been accompan ied by extensive civilian casual ties." Mr. Gollan said that for over a year the Americans had been waging a war on the civilian population, not concentrating on military targets as had been claimed. He had seen the victims of US bombing attacks, including peasants shot while swimming after work, children whose legs had been blown off and surviv- ing patients from a leprosarium bombed by US aircraft despite a big red cross painted on the roof. The main significance of the recent raids was that they meant the stepping up of the Americans' terror tactics and disgracing the name of western civilisation among these people, living at comparatively primitive standards.
