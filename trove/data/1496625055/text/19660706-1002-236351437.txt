 Ruthlessness in Spain pjERE is yet another story of the police-state treatment of workers in Franco's Spain. It concerns Herminio Minguez Ducal, a tram conductor in the Madrid Municipal Transport Service (E.M.T.) who was elect ed by the transport workers to attend a conference to negotiate a new collective contract with the Department of Transport. The management and the chief of the Franco government- controlled union attempted to force the negotiators to accept the same conditions as before the conference. The transport workers refused this. Minguez Ducal and another three delegates were arrested and forced to sign false state ments, after months of inter rogation by the Franco police. . Minguez Ducal was sentenced to six years imprisonment and the others from two to five years. Minguez Ducal was released in 1964 and again arrested in 1965. He was accused of having "illegal propaganda" in his pos session, namelyâ€” a copy of a letter sent to the French League of Human Rights. For this, he has been sentenced to 41 years' imprisonment. There should be protests from Australia to the Government in Madrid against actions of the oppressive Franco regime and support for the Spanish work ers further struggle for a demo cratic Spain. C.V.
