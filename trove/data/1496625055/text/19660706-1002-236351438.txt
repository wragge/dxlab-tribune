 Christianity and Communism O? a recent occasion of 60me importance to me personally, I received messages of good will from the Methodist Church and from the Central Commit tee of the Communist Party of Australia. This collocation of import ant segments of Christianity and Communism is of more than private significance for, in spite of underlying philo sophical divergences, both are committed to the realisation of the brotherhood of man in all human relationships. This is an immense task in which there is unlimited scope for the co-operation of all who are dedicated to it. Probably it cannot be accom plished without the active fel lowship of Communism and Christianity, the two most per vasive organised influences in our world today. Mutual distrusts of many years will die hard, but that they should be speedily over come is essential to man's pro gress and well-being. E. E. y. COLLOCOTT, Sydney. NOTE: The occasien was the celebration by the Aus tralia-Soviet Friendship So ciety of the 80th birthday of Dr. Collocott, who is its na tional chairman.
