 False arguments defeat Communist A DELAIDE: Failure of the Woodville City Council to solve in reasonable time some of the difficult problems of the Semaphore Park District led to the defeat of Commun ist councillor Jim Mitchell in the elections last Saturday. In a record poll rate-payers swung to the alternative can didate who promised a- rapid solution to outstanding matters. Two of the problems, that of sewerage and storm water drainage have been the sub ject of local campaigning for a long period. At his final Council meeting Mr. Mitchell was able to have Council adopt a $16,0QQ loan program for storm water drains in an affected area and a further $11,300 loan money for street work. Thus his successor enters Council with a good basis for work in the immediate future. A new feature of local gov ernment elections in Wood ville this year was the. strong entry of Liberal Party organ isations and allied bodies be hind one of the mayoral can didates. The vigorous display on this occasion of Liberal activity has caused serious comment in Council and ratepayer circles which have traditional links with the labor movement. It is believed that a new political confrontation is likely to arise in future polls. Mr. Mitchell's opponent pro duced a special anti-communist leaflet quoting the R.S.L. con ference resolutions and refer ring to Vietnam amongst other matters. He declared with some effect apparently that the State Labor Government and the Woodville City Council would not assist the locality with works while it had a Communist represen tative. This argument is false and casts a slur on both Govern ment and Council which have functioned in the normal way and within the limits of their ability in the district.
