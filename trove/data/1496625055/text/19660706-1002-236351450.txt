After being sentenced at the Sydney court of Petty Sessions v last Friday the peace supporters were kept in the cells for some | hours while the necessary sure- I ties were being found. I r Those charged Those concerned were Messrs. Rex Hewitt, J. Stanistreet, J. Palmada, D. Jones, R. Darnley, M. Jones, D. McGregor and J. Munday. Police alleged that they were among 250 to 300 people who had demonstrated outside the American consulate in Sydney on June 30. It was claimed that they had sat down on the pave ment and "obstructed the pas sage of a person." For the defence Mr. M. May suggested that they had done this after the US consul had refused to see a deputation. He told Mr. Riley SM that the accused had taken part in a peaceful demonstration on an issue on which the Australian population was divided. Mr. May said that the placing of people on a bond for such an offence could hinder the ex ercise of their democratic rights.
