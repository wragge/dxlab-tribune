 Further talk-ins I planned by CPA Already there have been symposiums in Sydney and Melbourne on the draft Outline History of the Communist Party prepared by E. A. Bacon, a CPA spokesman said last week. A seminar on the Marx ist method in history has been arranged for August, and a symposium on auto- mation ano lis enecis upon the workers and the activ ity of the trade unions is planned. That such functions of fer, on many subjects, new possibilities for the free exchange of opinion, had been demonstrated by the history of symposiums, he said. Additional material on the history will be made available in roneoed form, and consideration will need to be given to pro posals to publish an exten sive history to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Communist Party in 1970. Immediately, however, probably the most effective procedure would be to prepare a brief publication drawing lessons from the past and reassessing var ious events and. decisions in the light of the Party's present understanding.
