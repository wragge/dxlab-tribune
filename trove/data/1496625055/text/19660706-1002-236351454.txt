 A rocket from Bankstown By Gloria Sanderson yHAT'S no rocket shooting across Sydney's skyline â€” i'.'s Bruce Steele! Bankstown's popular seller candidate added 34,000 to his votes with 120 extra sales and 28 sellers handling 5 papers each week. Newcastle also puts on a dazzling display. Charlie West opens his account with 10,000 votes earned by 28 annual subcr'.ptior. renewals and 7 new annual subscribers. With Paddy King steadily piling up points week by week, and the South Coast quietly confident, iU looks like a veritable battle of the giants for state honors in New South Wales. I've just had news one of Sydney's most popular "pop ular sellers" will he joining tho competition. Madge O'Grady who for years has been one of Tribune's staunchest wor kers will represent the team of Sydney Domain sellers. Looking forward to hearing from you, Madge! Red Faces over "Bluebag" Last week we made one of the worst "blues" you could make. To put the record straight; Bill Britton though he comes from Newtown has been and is one of South Sydney's staunchest supporters. The "rabbitos" were hopping mad about our misrepresentat ion and so was Bill. Many humble apologies, Bill!
