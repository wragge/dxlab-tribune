 Cut out heavy Viet fines, says Labor Council gYDNEY : The NSW Labor Council last week pro tested at the harshness of the fines imposed on peaceful demonstrators against the extension of the war in Vienam. Fines and bonds were impos ed on eight trade unionists and students who were arrested at a recent demonstration outside the US Consul's building in Syd ney. Good behaviour bonds of Â£50 for 12 months and fines in ad dition to 28 days hard labor should three of those arrested breach their bonds, wnere im posed for minor traffic offences. The Builders Labourers' Un ion, which sponsored the pro test said the union intends to contact all MLA's on this issue because of the principle in volved. "It is the right of our citi zens to peacefully protest for the policy of this Labor Coun cil and the Australian Labor Party against the extension of l the war in Vietnam. "We are of the opinion that that action has been taken in concert with the Holt Govern ment to dampen down public objections to the war in Viet nam on the eve of the Federal elections. "We must support the right of our people to protest without any fear of recrimination and in doing so help to bring about the defeat of the present Gov ernment, the BLF said. Mr. J.,Mundey (a BLF organ iser and' one of those arrested) told Council the arrests took place on the same night Labor Council condemned the Ameri can bombing of Hanoi. He said it was only after the US Consul refused to meet a deputation that some of the demonstrators sat down.
