 Mass exodus from Hanoi From Rupert Lockwood THE older suburbs of Hanoi re semble a disturbed beehive as cars, carts and bicycles loaded with humble personal possessions roll along narrow streets in a mass evacuation according to a Soviet newsagency correspondent in Hanoi. Many fathers and mothers in Hanoi are parted from their, child ren who are being taken to schools hidden in the jungle: to reduce the risks of American aerial mass acre. All pre-school children, primary, seven-year and secondary school pupils, pensioners and their families are being evacu ated immediately. The total evacuation will total about 300,000 and only essential work ers, staff and anti-aircraft uni1' s will remain. How- ever, evacuation cannot ensure complete safety from prowling American airmen. American planes just scored a hit with napalm and aiV.i-person- nel bombs on a primary school in Tanuen village with 60 casualties, mainly children.
