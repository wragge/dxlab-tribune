 Sll says hands off Cambodia From Rupert Lockwood TUfOSCOW: An official Sov- iet Government statement warns that provocative front ier actions againsjt Cambodia by America, Thai and baigon forces "have of late been as suming an ever more alarm ing nature". The Soviet statement says: "The American, Saigon and Thai forces are systematically violating the frontiers of Cam- V.bodia and invading her terri-; tory. The United States is stepping up military and poli- . tical pressure on Cambodia. I,t is beyond doubt that the acti- visation of provocations on the frontiers of Cambodia which must be inviolable is directly connected with the US course for escalation of aggressive actions in Indo China. "Tribute is paid in the Sov iet Union ,to the restraint and courage of the people and Government of Cambodia who are resolutely upholding the independence, neutrality and territorial integrity of the country."
