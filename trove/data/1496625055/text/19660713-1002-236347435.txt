 j u n j o r t r ' h n n e - UELLO there, j This week we have a story from Judith F. of New castle. Judith in her letter also mentions she is a member of the Junior Eureka League. This is the first story we have had from a reader, and I hope it will be just the beginning. My dream "1"HE afternoon felt hot and stuffy. 1 flopped on my bed and was soon fas!1- aslaArv 1 (oil aa Jf I was being whirled into space, beautiful colours en circled me, suddenly it all stopped. I found myself on the most beautiful island imaginable. The tropical palms swaying in the cool breeze made you think of lyre birds dancing to the music of bell birds. Turning and looking towards the sea I saw huge waves curling over, breaking, then running up onto the soft , yellow sand. Behind me were small flower covered hills, adorned with the most beautiful of colours here and there small trees blotted out the flowers. At the foot of one hill stood a small hut. Still breathing the scent of the flowers, I be- ban to walk towards it. Feel ing tired, and seeing a bed inside, I advanced quickly. The hut was absolutely charming inside, placed on a small, delicately carved table was a bowl of flowers. The beauty of the lush vegetation through the window was in credible. The Island was the most wonderful place I have ever been, I wish my dream lasted longer but my wish has not come true. â€” Judith F, II years, Newcastle, N.S.W.
