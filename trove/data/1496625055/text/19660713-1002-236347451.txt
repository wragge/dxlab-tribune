 Slow-moving but sincere THE WATERSIDERS, by Michael Davis (A H, & A. W. Reed Pty. Ltd.) $2. 15. Reviewed by ALEX DRENNAN (New Zea land) . MICHAEL DAVIS sets out to dispel the popu lar image of the wharfie as a "loafing anarchist". He does not write a plug for them but rather tries to understand, which is fair enough for a novel. But it misses out elsewhere. It is slow mov ing. The author worked two years on the wharf in Napier (New Zealand) . All the wharfie terms are . there, but the reading is too light for my taste. In places there is movie- style slapstick â€” "... he made a neat movement and struck a match &lt;on her behind. 'Well, I'm damn ed', he repeated, ignor ing the blonde's aston ished leap in the air." The story takes place a decade after the big 1951 lock-out, and that event receives some soft men- tion. After a death down the hold, a Londoner comments: "In the Old Dart the stevedore drives the sports car and the wharfie a bike. Out here it's sometimes the other way round. But it's still the wharfie that gets his- . self killed. Remember that, cocker." The story gets right into the thick of the wharfies. If it had got its teeth into something good there, and let it eat its way out, it would have been a book that we all would want to . read. As it is, anyone looking for the technical side of being a NZ wharfie should read "The Water- siders", by Michael Davis. (Available from New World || Booksellers and other book- 1 shops.) ii
