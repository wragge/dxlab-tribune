 Barred from a career in his own country by color, Dean Dixon (above) is a conductor with an enviable reputation in Europe, and as musical director of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra brought his current concert season to an impressive climax, leading the full orchestra and expanded choir in a performance of Mahler's Second sympnony. Dean Dixon's leadership of this long symphony brought it to a close with a swelling torrent of sound, with two hundred musicians and singers helped by the great organ with all stops out, giving everything they had to overwhelm the musical doubts and questions expressed along the way in a triumphant affirmation of faith in the ultimate triumph of humanity over resignation and despair. Such is the development of the orchestra and choir under his direction that we look forward to the time when he can give them his full attention which is at present shared by the Symphony orchestra of Frankfurt in Germany.â€” -H.
