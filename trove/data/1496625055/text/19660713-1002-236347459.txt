 Australian ship line YHE Seamen's Union of Australia advocates a policy of peace and goodwill to men of all nations and . resolutely opposes war. We seamen also recognise the urgency for a National Overseas Line which we con- cider should be an integral part of Australia's economic and defence system. Seamen are entitled to speak up on these issues because 3,000 Australian seamen serv® in the merchant navy in Won War II: In time, of war, wnen a seaman goes to work, he goe? to war. For many years the Austra lian Council of Trade UnlJr has pleaded with the comp cent Federal Government establish a National Overs Shipping line. In failing., , develop such a line the ernment has displayed a "eP able lack of initiative anu foresight. Tribune readers should not just allow the Federal Govern ment- to rely on overseas sin ping monopolies to servi Australia's vital overseas an oastal trade routes. They should support and activate themselves around i campaign. J. D. SEELEY, f, S.S. "Lake IUawarra. | L£A!MO r Ii/s -foi you l"
