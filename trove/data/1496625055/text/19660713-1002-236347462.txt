 Unplanned automation WISITING North Queens land after an absence of some years, I was very dis turbed by the unfavorable and really tragic trends of the economy as well as social life arising from unplanned implementation of automat ion in the sugar industry, on the waterfront. ' As a result of the huge re duction of the . number of workers in the sugar mills, the closure of the Cairns railway workshop there is a squeeze oh the small business man; many have already gone out of business and have sought employment, in larger firms which are in a stronger position to withstand the economic squeeze. Whole towns such as Tully, Babinda and Gordonvale are reduced to ghost towns. An example . of automation is a farmer who previously would have required a work force of about 24 me.n, now using a huge harvester manned by his four sons, employs three other men part time. Sugar mills, previously pros perous, are in the grip of the banks who virtually own them. If the people had decent political leadership this situat ion brought about by unplanned automation could have been at least partly prevented by the establishment of other industries but I suppose planned thinking would be alien to capitalist economy.
