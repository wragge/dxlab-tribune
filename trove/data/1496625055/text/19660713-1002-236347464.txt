 Letters to the iliifl WHEN IS A WAR BASE NOT A WAR BASE? Answer: When it's in New Guinea j NOTICED that at the United Nations Trustee ship Council at New York a spokesman for the Soviet i Union, Mr. Romanovich, said that the Soviet Union had information that Aus tralia was converting the jointly administered Terri tories into an aggressive military base. This wais denied by the Aus tralian delegate, Mr. Dudley McCarthy, I thought it might interest your readers to send down what was published in the South Pacific Post about the establishment of the bases in' New Guinea. Readers of Tribune can draw their own conclusions. The Post in its issue of October 9, 1964, said, under. this headline, "Big Air Force Base, £20 Million De- icnoc vyuiiw) , mm a nuge xo Air Force base will be built at Botam, near Wewak. "The expansion includes be sides the Air Force base: "£4 million on the water transport division base in Port , Moresby. . "$4 million extension to Murray Barracks. "£2 million on extensions at Taurama Barracks. "£1.6 million on extensions of the Goldie River Training Depot. "An estimated £2 million for the setting up of two Euro pean' army battalions at Lae. "£2 million on extensions of Moem Army Base." Where then does this leave Mr. McCarthy's denial of the Soviet delegate's charge? A. New Guinea reader.
