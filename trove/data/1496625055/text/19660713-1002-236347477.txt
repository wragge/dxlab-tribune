 foreign jbplicf: yotirt'S j piRST results of a pub lic opinion poll on conscription carried out by delegates last Satur day morning were an- nounced at the 23rd NSW State Conference of the Eureka Y outh League in Sydney last weekend. Opening the session on Youth and Foreign Policy, Mr. Rex Hewett gave the figures from a breakdown of the first 420 questionnaires returned. Forum organiser Gerry Watt said the EYL was hoping this would be a very unique get- together of young people. While delegates from unions and jobs would be especially welcortie the Forum would be open to all young people. Young people were being asked to come along and speak their minds, whether it was on wages or allowances, conscription or training, sport or entertainment. Conference delegates on Sat urday morning had sold over 40C copies of the magazine Target and conducted the public opinion poll, in Suther land, East Sydney, Balmain and Blacktown. The results so far had shown that 86.7 per cent were in favor oi conscription if Australia were attacked, yet only 29.2 per cent were in favor of Aus tralian conscripts being sent tc Vietnam, while 66.6 per cent were opposed. 61.5 per cent were in favor of a referendum on sending conscripts overseas. Opening the Conference State President Don McDonald said: "We need to fearlessly look at our work and put forward not only what we are against but also show what we are for." minimi— «BBm—Ean——ng—a« JOHN GREGORY Technician, aged 21 "First stop conscripts going to Vietnam."
