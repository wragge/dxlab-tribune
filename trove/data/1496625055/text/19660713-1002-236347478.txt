 CROSSMAN Dave Baldwin with his colour ful stand at King's Cross. Call in a computer i By Gloria Sanderson I LA5\ week's news of the 1 Bankstown rocket brought 1 an immediate 'phone call' 1 from Paddy King's Maritime | supporters announcing tneya h be launching a space ship 1 from their area . . . and it | was no idle boast! 1 30 sellers who sell more than 5 Tribunes every week brought Paddy 1,000 votes each, helping to take his total to the compu- tor-size tally of 74,716! To show the contest won't be a walk-over in Sydney, Dave Baldwin added 23,600 to his score and Frank Hamill opened his account with 17,000. In Newcastle there's a close tussle developing with Red Lobley, Clarrie Lobley and Charlie West vying for top hon ours. Not so spectacular— but in the overall adding up to consider able finance and Tribune sales building — are the extra hund reds and thousands of points chalked up by other candidates from week to week. They're all putting up an effort to benefit the paper which is the real ob jective of the Popular Seller competition. I'd still like to receive items of news interest from our can didates and 'photos of popular sellers in action, SYDNEY Paddy King (Maritime) 74,716 Bruce Steele (Bankstown) 35,200 Dave Baldwin (East Syd ney) 24,000 Frank Hamill (Cumber land) 17,400 Bill Sanderson (Peters ham) 7,073 Bill Britton (Newtown) 5,435 Stan Knopman (Bondi) 1,586 Jack Dye (Kogarah Hotel Stand) 800 Jannali 530 Jane Tabberer (Narra- been) „ 500 Bob Greentree (Liverpool) 300 Vic McAnalen (Canter bury) 224 NEWCASTLE Red Lobley (Seamen) 11,300 Clarrie Lobley (Wall- send) 10,300 Charlie West (Cooks 1 Hill) 10,000 Butch Wharton (Mere- wether) 800 SOUTH COAST Rus Critcher (Nebo) 8,550 SOUTH AUSTRALIA Joe Brazel (Adelaide) 2,700 Lorraine Loyden (Sema phore) 1,600 Edith Semmler (Chelten ham) 1,022 Pat Flintoft (Enfield Pros pect) 700 Ted Dyer (Rail) 600 Jeff Thomas (Marion) 500 Val Burns (Norwood) 200 TASMANIA Barbara Bound (Hobart Town) 2,837 WESTERN AUSTRALIA Adam (Belmont-Midland) 2,620 Isla (Innaloo) 200
