 Unions to clean up building game gYDNEY : The Building Trades Group of unions have decided to "clean up the building industry." ine August meeting of the group will plan a big campaign to include wide publicitv and exposure of bad practices and conditions in the industry. Demands will be made on the Government to legislate to pro tect workers' interests. A job action campaign has been suggested by the BWIU with the aim of achieving an agreement with the Master Builders' Association. In a letter to the Group the BWIU said: "Recent changes in the building industry such as the extension of sub -contracting have led to the undermining of conditions and standards that have been won by the building unions over the yeas. "For example, there is a growing frequency of cases where workers are being denied their wages through sub-con tractors either going bankrupt or disappearing without paying the wages. " 'All-in' methods of .payment aimed at denying workers pay ments for wet weather, annual leave and other entitlements are developing. "Sub-contracts are being let to persons who are not nor mally employed in the industry and who do not have the ne cessary trade qualifications, at a time when building workers are finding it more difficult to get employment. "There is a growing disregard for job conditions, hygiene and safe working conditions."
