 Sydney wharf ies seek attendance pay lift OYDNEY: The Job Delegates' Association on the Sydney waterfront is planning a campaign to ease the chronic unemployment among waterside workers. Over the past month the average daily unemployment has been i,uw men ana one aay last week it reacnea a peak of 2,000. JDA Secretary, Mr. J. Healy said the men are demand ing a six hour minimum attendance money payment. This would guarantee a weekly wage rate of $38 as against the present $15.50 paid to waterside workers when no work is available. Mr. Healy said the Federation has shown its good faith throughout the present all-in conferences. It is now up to the employers to show their good faith by paying increased attendance money. He pointed out that that the union's attendance money demand of $38 is still far short of the employers' $45 a week offer as a base rate for permanent employment. Since . September last year there has been a big drift of young workers from the waterfront. These young men with dependant wives and small children have been forced to leave the industry because of the low weekly earnings. The JDA is calling on gangs and delegates to organise deputations to Federal Members of Parliament, the shipowners and the Stevedoring Industry Authority. The job delegates are also planning a large delegation to the NSW Labor Council's Living Standards Conference to be held in Sydney on July 30. Among the demands the delegates will take up is the need for the nationalisation of the industry.
