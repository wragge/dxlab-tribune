 Does Johnson have disease ? From Rupert Lockwood JyURRAY Kempton, in a despatch from America tc the London Spectator says that watch- ing President Johnson these days "is very much like observing the pro gress of a disease". Kempton says "He was marvellously im pressive as a confidence man; he only depresses as a bully." The Spectator corres pondent forecasts that before the November elections Johnson "will be desperate and commence to do desperate things.'' The London Morning Star comments "This is the man and this is the' Policy which Mr. Wilson supports." And this is the man with whom Holt wants to go all the way.
