 Warsaw powers ready with DRV volunteers From Rupert Lockwood OSCOW: A new crisis looms for the bombers of Hanoi as the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Treaty member nations take positive steps to im plement the Bucharest decisions. An official Soviet announcement says, that the CPSU political bureau and the Soviet Government have: â€” "Instructed competent gov ernment agencies to take all necessary steps flowing from this (Bucharest) statement in support of x the Vietnamese people including those con nected with rendering econo mic and military aid to repel American aggression with due account of the requirements caused by the new phase of the Vietnam war." The CPSU political bureau and the USSR Council of Ministers in this official state ment emphasised that the Bucharest Warsaw Treaty de cisions were "a new important confirmation of the growing unity and cohesion of socialist countries". Pravda says that the Sov iet people's views are in full accord with the Warsaw Treaty members' readiness to allow volunteers to go to Viet nam if requested by the De mocratic Republic of Viet nam Government. Soviet army paper Red Star in an editorial on the Buch- arest declarations said: "No one and nothing, not even Mc- Namara's electronic comput ers, can foresee the develop ment of events if the United States does not come to its senses and does not stop fan ning the flames of war in Vietnam." Red Star warns that American escalation "may cause a chain reaction that will transcend the bound aries of Asia". The official Soviet warning of positive action to aid Viet nam beat off the foreign at tackers comes as Washington prepares ever more escalation. Saigon puppets and certain Pentagon generals are calling for land invasion of North Vietnam and more brutal bombings. British Tory leader Regin ald Maudling claimed that Soviet leaders told him on his visit to Moscow that American aggression in Vietnam "has brought the world almost to the razor's edge between peace and war".
