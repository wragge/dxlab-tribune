 Outof . Commonwealth REPORTS over the last few days indicate that at least two African Presidents — Ken neth Kaunda of Zambia (above, left) and Tanzania's Julius Nyerere (above, right) — are fast running out of patience at Britain's chronic failure to resolve the Rhode - sian crisis — so much so that they are now threatening to leave the British Common wealth. The crisis, now dragging on into its eighth month, was precipitated by rebel racialist Ian Smith's declaration of whites-only Unilateral Inde pendence. Britain's tepid at tempt to topple Smith through "sanctions" — mainly designed as a sop to militant African pressure — have proved purely farcical. Rhodesia has been left with abundant loopholes and considerable burdens have been forced on land locked Zambia. Meanwhile, Rhodesia's four million Afri cans are no closer to majority rule. President Kaunda has now taken the first steps towards pulling Zambia out of the "Club" in protest against the ineffectualness of British pol icy towards Rhodesia, and British leaders are worried that other African Common wealth members may follow suit. Tanzania, which was one of -the seven African nations to break diplomatic relations with Britain over UDI, has been tipped as the most likely after Zambia to sever its Commonwealth links.
