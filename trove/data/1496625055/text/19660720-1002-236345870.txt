 Harry Stein goes Zen — Another wild night up at the Cross IT was one of those cold and miserable nights Sydney has been having lately. So it looked like another wild night at the Cross for me. Borrow a hook from the library and hover over the radiator. As I walked along to the library, the spruiker outside the Heavenly Club called out "Come inside and meet the lovely young Ilady that certain gentle man got all lost over." I sidled up and said, "You mean he and she." "You catch on fast" he replied. "Look", I said, "just what was between those two? After all, the big age gap, and him being a man of the world and all that!" "How old are you son?" the spruiker asked. I tell and he said "You are nearly old enough," and then he tells me all. "The rapport between those two," he said, "was just amazing, and the thing he admired most about her was her mind. "She is really terribly, terribly intellectual and to gether they spent many long winter nights discus sing Zen Buddhism. Yes, she is quite an expert on the subject. "But why don't you come in and meet her? You are just her type — short, robust and very, very intellectual " So I cordially thanked hi,m and agreed to drop in to meet her for a long chat on my way back from the library. I want a book all about Zen Buddhism, I tell the I librarian. She put her fingers to her lips and said shshsh Be careful what you are saying — you are right next to the children's section of the library. She then bent under the counter and handed me a slim volume in a plain envelope. "You be sure to have this back in a week," she says, "it is under very heavy demand". "Don't worry," I replied "if I'm not back in a week just ask the first Good Samaritan you meet, he'll know where I am."
