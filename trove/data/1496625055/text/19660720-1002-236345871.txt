 A sad tale of the Never-Never J YDNEY : A prospectus issued by H. G. Palmer ' Ltd. was altered to remove any hesitancy or warning about the company's prospects when, in fact, more than half its major assets were bad dehls. Crown witnesses and the Crown Prosecutor, Mr. Shan non, QC, alleged this at the start of the HG Palmer case ir. -Sydney's Central Court. A'.; June 30, 1964, the com pany had. more than 100,000 potential bad debtors owing more than $29 million. These bad debts were included in the company's main asset — $48 million in outstandings on hire purchase contracts. The prospectus issued was based on these misleading fig ures, Mr. Shannon said. It was a most optimistic and enticing publication graph ically depicting on the cover the association between the company (H. G. Palmer's) and MLC Ltd." This deception induced the public to lend $4 million to K. G. Palmer for unsecured notes and debentures, it was alleged. Other "highlights" of the pro ceedings included. Statements that MLC officers and directors were warned about the huge unack nowledged number of bad debts before they published the prospectus. Allegations that MLC-H.G. Palmer directors failed to withdraw the prospectus after the company started trading at a loss and they made sudden larger bad debt provisions. Mr. Shannon said the pros pectus was altered when the company in fact had a "grave, immense and growing bad debt problem unacknowledged in the company's accounts." "The situation was of such dimensions as to render false the whole of the accounts and the entire statement of accounts in the prospectus," he said. The nine men before the court include two directors and a former general manager of MLC Ltd., and a former Lord Mayor of Sydney — Sir Norman Nock of Nock and Kirby fame.
