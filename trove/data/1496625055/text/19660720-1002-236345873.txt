 I it n ; f\ r t r i K n n a |ELLO Tribune Juniors, Recently I received another copy of that terrific children's magazine from France, Jeunes Annees ("Young Years"). Apart from a section for the Junior Naturalists there is a whole section on a wonderful idea called "CARTONVILLE". it is a good idea for your school fete, or any other kind of fete, and a really good idea for the Junior Eureka League Camps. All you need is a lot of empty cardboard cartons, sticky tape, glue, paints and patience. You can plan a model vil lage or re-enact some section of history. The photograph of a finished Cartonville above gives you some idea, of the finished effect. The JEL's in Sydney usually have a stall for the Tribune Fair so this might be am idea they'd like to take up — you might like to use it in your State— you could charge a small donation for people to have a tour through your city. The little figures are made from cardboard, but you might like to use dolls. Unfortunately there is not enough room to show you all the pictures but the builders of this village are not all jun iors. If any of you decide to have a go we'd like to see a photo of the results. Winner winner of the flowers of the States was Nell Symes of Liverpool. Here are the answers that Nell gave (all illustrated) : 1, Waratah (NSW) ; 2, Common Pink (Victoria) ; 3, Red and green Kangaroo Paw (West Australia); 4, Cooktown Orchid (Queensland); 5, Sturt Pea (South Australia) ; 6, Great Blue Waterlily (Nth. Terri tory) ; 7, Blue Gum (Tas mania); 8, Wattle (Australia). Congratulations, Nell! Miniature town of Cartonville built entirely from from cardboard packs.
