 Pickets step crashers' SYDNEY: With criminal disregard for human life, truck owner-drivers, during the night last week, with lights off and number plates partly cov ered, drove straight at striking pickets at up to 40 mph outside the gates of Imperial Chemical In dustries. About 100G production, main tenance and transport workers at the company's Sydney plant have been on strike for over two weeks for a $4 weekly wage rise. Earlier, workers at the Mel bourne and Adelaide plants were also on strike in sup port of the same demand. The Sydney men will meet today (Wednesday) to discuss a return to work. They say they have now suc ceeded in stopping the "picket line breakers". For a couple of nights last week the striking unionists' lives — and the public — were en dangered by transport trucks in the employ of ICIANZ crash ing through picket lines at the gates of ICIANZ at Matraville. The trucks, about eight one night and three the next, with headlights switched off and their number plates partly cov- erer, drove at speeds up to 40 mph through the picket lines, causing the unionists to jump for their lives. "They were nearly all 'owner- drivers'," the strikers told Tri bune. "The other transport company drivers were OK. When told what the strike was about they just turned around," said the strikers. "Women, children, anyone could have been killed," said Mr. Dave Cunningham, the Ironworkers' site union dele gate. "I chased three trucks in my car, They had their lights turned off, their number plates covered and raced at over 40 mph," said Mr. Cunningham. Commented one of the strik ers about the incident: "It seems the ICIANZ influence doesn't stop at the factory gates."
