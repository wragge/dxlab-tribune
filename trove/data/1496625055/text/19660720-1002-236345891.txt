 Injustice for pensioners As the law now stands a male receives the aged pen sion at 65 years and a female at 60 years. A grave injustice occurs when there is a greater difference than five years in the ages of a man and his wife. I know men well over the seventies still working be cause of this anomaly and it is common for men to be at least 10 years older than their wives. Unfortunately if you turn 65 before your wife turns 60 you can't win, for if your wife goes to work and earns more than $14 you cannot get the pension due to permissible in come regulations. So a married couple in the above age bracket can take their choiceâ€” try to live on one pension which is impos sible, or the man keeps on working until he drops both of work and old age. The other alternative is to send the wife to work to keep her husband on a wage that is only a portion of the male There is no doubt that the law must be altered to pro vide that when a man reaches retiring age his dependant wife should also receive the full pension, subject only to permissible income as it ap plies to property. There is an opportunity for trade unionists to take a keener interest in this mat ter, particularly in view of the Living Standards Confer ence. This is election year so if you suffer, or will suffer, in later years under this injus tice, put the proposition to candidates to work for amend ment to this law. Jim Sharrock (Redfern).
