 FOLKSONG With a guitar chord. An insight to past Joys and Struggles In a way not Seen before. People listening, though Often singing too. And as they sing We are side by side With an American negro, An Aldermaston marcher. Or in the backwoods or bush Of a centurg ago. > Perhaps before the song A word is spoken. And with the song we Understand and appreciate What we barely saw before. I am laughing at some new fun Going away happy. Itoo can sing with Some purpose, Work easier with such A Song. Terence Moore
