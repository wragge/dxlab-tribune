 HAND OF FRIENDSHIP TO VIETNAM PEOPLE "Jepari t" crew writes to Tribune Letters to the Editor WE- the Seamen's Union members on board the M/V "Jeparit", now en route to Vietnam, would like to thank you , for the very fair and honest coverage that you gave this vessel, along with the "Boonaroo", when we were protesting against manning ships carrying war material which will be used to help the acts of aggression against the Vietnamese people. The Seamen's Union, along with the whole Labour movement and sane-thinking people from all .walks of life, condemn this filthy war, started by the US war-lords in the interests of the Wall St. industrialists, backed by their Australian counter parts and fully supported by the Holt Government. The fact that, as members of a militant trade union, we are being directly in volved in this, filth, weighs heavy on our minds. We appreciate that Tribune, along with the Guardian, has always spoken up in support of the workers and the . Trade Union movement, and has played a majoi role in the fight against the conscription of Aus tralian youth to the Viet nam war. The "Jeparit" may b&lt; sailing to that war, bul the Seamen's Union mem bers pn board extend tc the Vietnamese peoph our fraternal friendship, in the hope that peace and independence will soon be theirs. Once again thanking you for your support in the past, and we hope that next November will see the first step towards a better life for all â€” that is, the defeat of the Holt Government. K. Hall, On behalf of the crew, M/V "Jeparit".
