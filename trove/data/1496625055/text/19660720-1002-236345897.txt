 ORR: I victory fin death || I By a Correspondent 1 I yHE death of Syd- 8 I ney Sparkes Orr 1 i does not overshadow I | the victory he won by | his courage and per- | sistence over those 8 who victimised him. I Taking uj> the cause of I administrative reform in I ,the University of Tasmania, I he found himself in head- on collision with the Es tablishment. He was framed, sacked and black balled from "Society". But he fought on and his persistence won to his side the bulk of university teachers throughout Aus tralia who declared black his vacant chair of philo sophy. It is unfair of a special correspondent of The Aus tralian to suggest that 8 some imputation rests on him. The fact tha,t the Uni versity of Tasmania paid him a large sum in com pensation for wrongful dismissal and his main opponent resigned from the Council was as much vindication as anyone could expect. Few people are as easy to "frame" on sex charges as teachers. Frequently all such a teacher can do is to demand a full and fair inquiry and this Orr did. | It was no fault of his that the authorities refused to | reopen the case. | He may have been "no 1 giant", as The Australian's | writer suggests, but he got 1 better results than many I a giant has done in 6uch | circumstances. The Tas- B manian University isn't the | place it was when he ar- I rived.
