 Thanks for greetings JpLEASE convey to the Com munist Party central com mittee the thanks and appre ciation of my wife and my self for the pree tines sent. +n me on the occasion of my 90th birthday. One of a trade union fam ily in the days when we had to fight to retain organisation I early learned of the need for and value of protest meet ings, demonstrations and struggle. My teachers in those early days were trade union social ists not afraid to speak out and speak up, who laughed when the British gutter press brought out the articles and cartoons the socialist tiger and the red octopus, seeking, to make the people fear us. Socialists have always fought for unity, contending that the helping hand builds friendship and brings peace. We are not daunted when threats are made to bring ut "White Papers" as we kn0 that all who are game enough to openly fight for freedom . are tabbed by the .powers-tn&t- be as dangerous persons. The common people always respond when a clear, human case is put to them. When wj trade union and Labor ar leaders together plan a P ?" gram of action to solve many problems of our coun try and its people, fewiesw present it as the voice of i&o throughout the Common wealth, we will have a g ernment really labour and no afraid of its objectiveâ€” s ialisation of production distribution. Yours for unity, Jack Kim urn (Belmore).
