 Girl burns Aborigines powers Act CYDNEY: A copy of the 1909 NSW Aborigine Protection Act was burnt outside the NSW Parlia ment last Wednesday, by 21 years old Sydney Uni versity art student, Sue Johnson. She was backed up by 15 other students whe were demonstrating against the trial of two Sydney students who were in court that day at Bowraville on the NSW north coast, for breaches of the Aborigines' Protection Act. It was alleged that they accepted an invitation of Aborigine children to visit their home on a reserve. The magistrate dismissed the charges on the grounds that it could not be proved that the homes were on a reserve. Sue Johnson, who is the secretary of the Student Action for Aborigines Com mitted, explaining to the press why she had burnt the copy of the Act, said: "I burnt the Act because Section 8 prohibits anyone from entering an Aborigine reserve without permission of the police or Aborigine Welfare Board. I feel that this mitigates against assim- ilation which is supposed to be the policy of the Govern ment. "This Act also gives police rights to enter the reserves. The relations between the police and the Aborigines are not very good and the Act gives the police powers that are easily abused. "We have had complaints about this from Aborigines I in Moree, Bowraville and I Bogadilla. 1 "They have a strong griev- 1 ance because under the Act I police can enter their homes 1 without a warrant. This i,s | something that they wouldn't 1 dare do to a white family." 1 Recently a petition signed I by 50 Aborigines in Moree claimed that police entered their reserve and searched houses at any hour. Before the action was taken by Miss Johnson, a police sergeant read out sections of the Printing and other Acts to try and prevent her burn ing the Act.
