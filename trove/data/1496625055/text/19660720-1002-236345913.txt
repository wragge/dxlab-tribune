 GOVT. HELP SOUGHT FOR UNWED MOTHERS SYDNEY : The Australian Women's Charter is pressing for full payment of Social Services to unmarried: mothers living with their parents and says that Government assistance should be given to young girls arrested on morals charges. The Charter's president, Miss Lucy Woodcock, said the means test which is now applied to the girl's family in many cases results in the unmarried mother being forced into hostels. If she goes to a hostel she . ..$2 tov the cHHcC tfut " 'if'' iiving W" "home gets only $4,50. "These hostels are in the main only . venues for adopt ion," Miss Woodcock said. "It is much better for the mother and child to be kept with sympathetic parents, but the present situation often makes this impossible due to financial difficulties." Miss Woodcock, who was a school teacher and headmistress for 47 years, said her 23 years at Erskineville Public School re vealed many examples of the effect" this problem has on children. She said this problem was among the matters her organ- isation would be raising at the NSW Labor Council's Living Standards Conference this month in Sydney. Miss Woodcock said another matter which needs serious attention is the number of girls between the ages of 14 and 18 who' come- before the court on morals charges. "Every Monday morning about $3,000 are collected from these girls at Central Police Court, but nothing is done by the Governments to try and rehabilitate these young wo men. "All that the authorities seem to care about is the revenue they receive from prostitution." She said that many of these girls originally came from the country looking for work. "These girls, particularly the young ones, need proper assist ance, housing and education," Miss Woodcock said.
