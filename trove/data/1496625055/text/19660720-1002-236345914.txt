 Kocan case Court hearing , Labor leader came close SYDNEY: How terribly close to death Opposition Leader A. A. Calwell came on the night of June 21 was disclosed in the evidence at last week's lower-court hearing of the charge against Peter Ray mond Kocan of attempted murder. A piece of a bullet was af terwards extracted from his chin, along with pieces of glass from the car window. Another part of a bullet was taken from his coat collar, close to the lapel. A few inches of difference would have turned what some papers are already playing down as "the Mosman incident" into a tragedy with grave implica tions for Australian political life. Kocan was stated to have said that he wanted to assassinate a public figure so as to set mmself apart from "other no bodies". Kocan allegedly said: "I did not agree with Mr. Calwell's politics and that made it easy to choose him." Mr. Barry Robinson, secre tary of the Youth Campaign Against Conscription, testified that after the shooting he had, n the spur of the moment, asked Kocan: "Are you a mem ber of the Nazi Party?" Kocan had not replied. Mr. Wayne Haylen testified that after the shooting he had pursued and caught Kocan. Evidence was that' after fir- ing, Kocan had thrown away a gun which was produced in court. Kocan, aged 19, is short and of slight build. He wore horn rimmed spectacles. He appeared to be listening closely to the evidence and conferred occasionally with his counsel, Mr. K. Murray. At one stage when Mr. Mur ray was temporarily absent, Ko can was asked whether he would allow the case to go on. Kocan declined. Mr. Calwell gave evidence in a clear, firm voice. His face showed no trace of the injury he had suffered. Kocan was committed for trial at the next sittings of the Central Criminal Court, begin ning on August 15. Mr, A. A. CALWELL
