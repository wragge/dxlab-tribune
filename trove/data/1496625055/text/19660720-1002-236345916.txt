 Young man I in a hurry By June Mills "JN haste to catch the post, am still a young man in a hurry," wrote my long-time friend J.K. when sending $2 donation to Tribune Fund. I can only admire the spirit of this man who for upwards of 60 years has been an ad vocate of international socialism. There are many fine old "'Stal wafts """"of the labor movement who recognise Tribune as an- important medium for socialism and they include a. number of pensioners who from their meagre pension spare a dollar or sometimes more, like W.R., for, example, who this week sent $3. It won't take such a big whack to get that indicator up to the $2,000 markâ€” $33.01 is what's needed. Let's try and make it next week!
