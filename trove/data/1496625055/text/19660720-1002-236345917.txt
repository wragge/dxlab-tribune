 Special ACTU wage-rise talks urged JYDNEY: The Australian Council of Trade Unions has been asked to call a special Federal Unions' Conference to review the wages position and plan a national campaign for the improvement of wage standards. This proposal was made by the NSW Labor Council last week following its condemna tion of the national wage deci sion. Council said the Common wealth Arbitration Commis sion's basic wage and margins decisions "constitute a further attack on Australian living standards. "The claim of the unions was for an increase of $4.30 in the basic wage to meet price in creases of $2.30 since the 1964 basic wage decision, and an additional $2.10 as a share of the increased productivity. "The increase of $2.00 in the basic wage is less than the price increases since 1964 and nothing whatever has been given for in creased productivity. "The judgment also makes clear that the Commission is more determined than ever in its opposition to quarterly cost- -of-living adjustments to the basic wage, and that it has gone a long way towards adopting the claim of the employers for so-called total wage rates. "The deferring of a decision on the margins claims, pending an investigation by a Commis sioner into work values and relativities, is a further attack on wage standards. "It defers adjustment of mar gins for an indefinite period and could lead to the ending of national cases on margins affect ing the trade unions as a whole, and lead to individual hearings for the various industries in volving long delays and heavy costs. The Commission has re jected in advance the claim for restoration of 1947 relativities. Council said the failure of the Commission to concede any real advance in wages imposes on the trade union movemen4- the task of continuing its campaign of direct negotiations with em ployers to secure the wage claims of the ACTU.
