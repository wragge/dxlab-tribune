 Metal unions to share premises CYDNEY. The Boilermakers' and Blacksmiths' Society and the Amalgamated Engineering Union have de cided to combine their Research Departments and to move their federal offices into the one building. This move is part of the step being taken for closer cooperation between both organisations which together embrace almost 120 thousand trade unionists. Mr. J. Garland, Secretary of the AEU's Commonwealth Council, and other AEU federal leaders attended the recent meeting of the Boilermakers' Federal Council at which the above proposals were agreed upon. It is proposed that the Federal Office of the Boiler makers and Blacksmiths move into the AEU's building in Chalmers Street, Sydney and that the Sydney District Committee of the AEU join the Sydney Boilermakers in their Castlereagh Street premises. Discussions have also been held by the AEU with the Moulders, Sheet Metal Workers and Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen but as yet developments towards closer cooperation with these unions are still in the talking stages.
