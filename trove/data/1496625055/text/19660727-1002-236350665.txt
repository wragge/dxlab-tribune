 Cleaners step en S. Coast IXfOLLQNGONG: Cleaners at Wollongong, Corrimal, Berkeley and Kemblawarra public schools held one-hour protest stoppages last week over the failure of the Public Service Board to pay female cleaners on the agreed pay day. Without conferring with the Miscellaneous Workers' Union, the board has issued a circular directing headmasters and de partment supervisors that if a cleaner had time off during a pay period, the pay cheque is to be immediately returned to the department for re-issue. District organiser for the Union, Mr. Nixon, said that this order means that many people do not get their cheques for periods up to five weeks. "In Wollongong the women arc saying, no pay, no work," he said. Mr: Nixon said a conference between the . Government's Stores Department and the union last year established that if a cheque did not arrive on the date payable, then the Education Department in Wol longong was to re-issue the cheque immediately.
