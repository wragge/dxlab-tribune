 I Harry Stein goes ail the way 1 Trouble with Zara's brass euphonium | TOLD the doctor I was having trouble with my Watusi.. He said not to worry — it was to oe expected at my time of life. He asked if I'd taken I anything for it. I told him yes, two les sons from Fred Astaire. Did it help, he asked? Well, I said, it helped my Watusi, but there was the side effects. Well, he said, Rome was not built in a day, you know. I told him this might be solace for an Italian mem ber of the Builders' Lab orers' Federation, but I was a member of the A.J.A. He then asked me to have a look at his Frug. It was awful. He begged for advice. I suggested he might lubricate the joint, so he opened a bottle. He said it gave him ever so much relief. He wanted to give me a cheque for my usual jour- B nalist's consulting fee of i a hundred guineas, but I I told him that like Mac- | quarie St. we always sent our bills out at the end of the month. Just then the phone rang. He picked up the receiver, listened attenti vely and said he was on his way. Quick, he said, you'd bet ter join me on this one as a special consultant. It's Zara Holt, he ex plained. Harold got his head stuck right up her brass euphonium. She 1 kept repeating, "Oh, Har- 1 old, how could you?" but I all he could mutter was: I "You know how I am these days— I just have to go all the way." 1
