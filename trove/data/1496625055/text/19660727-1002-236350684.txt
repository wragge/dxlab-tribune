 LONER ON THE MAKE I A LFIE, the hero of Lewis Gilberts film of the same name — now showing at Sydney's Paramount — is a young man on the make. His world is inhabited entirely by "birds" — the sexually eligible section of the female sex aged between 15 and 50— and he accepts their favours without feeling or affection as they tumble eagerly into his bed or the back of his car. But it's a lonely world. Alfie trusts no one and loves no one. His philosophy is a simple one of looking after himself and ,not getting "involved". As soon as his conquests start to show any permanent interest in him, says Alfie, it's time to blow through. On he moves to the- next source of pleasure. But independent as he tries to be, Alfie cannot help getting in volved with other people — or at leas', by his irresponsibility In affecting and even ruining their lives. Gildn— beautifully played by Julia Foster— mothers h's chilld and pours out her love on him, but when Alfie fails to respond marries a dull but sincere bus- driver, taking the baby — the only being who really means anything tf hirr. — with her. A chance escapade with the frustrated middle-aged wife of a fellow sanatorium-inmate (Vivien 1KB Merchant) leads to her pregnancy.
