 WA draftee's funeral Farmer of 21 sent to die in Vietnam pERTH: The Government's policy on conscription was criticised by the Rev. Dr. B. R. Adderley after he had conducted Requium Mass at the funeral of WA's first national service conscript to die in v letnam. The small town of Nannup came to a standstill on Friday for the funeral of Lance-Corporal Marinko ("Tich") Tomas, 2'1, who was buried with full military honors in the dairy-farming district where his family has toiled for 35 years. "The present policy of conscription is unjustified, unjust ancl Chorally wrong'';' said Dr. Adderley, speaking as a private citizen. Though he thought Australia's involvement in Viet nam "was both necessary and honorable", Di\ Adderley said conscription for military service there was a very different matter. People not consulted "I do not think that the Australian Government, or any democratic government for that matter has the rightl — and I am not now talking of legal right but of moral right — to conscript a random selection of young men to engage in a shooting war overseas while the rest of the population stays home and does nothing. . . "No real attempt has been made by the Government to call for volunteers, nor have the people been con sulted", he said. Since "Tich" Tomas, of sturdy Yugoslav stock, apply ing their natural love of the land to their dairy farm at Cundinup, died in Phouc Tuy province from a shrapnel wound, his family have been deluged with more than 300 letters of sympathy from people all over Australia. "Tich's" boyhood friend, "Daily News" columnist John Cornell, wrote a poignant article on the scene at Cun dinup after the funeral. "How senseless, not just the war in Vietnam, but all war, seemed on that wet, green farm last night."
