 Little America A USTRALIA becomes more like America every day. One could even go so far as to call it little America. We ape our American counter parts in every conceivable way — music, the way we dress, our radio and television sta tions (with the exception of the ABC) are all dominated by false American propa ganda. The Government of our country is pursuing a policy of warlike aggression against the people of Vietnam because the masters in Washington dictate that it must be so. I shudder to think what it will be like in five years or even less. Already I feel I don't belong in Australia, because if one is anti-American or opposed to their actions in Vietnam, then one must be a Com munist, and if one is a Com munist there is no place for MBWBHIIWIIIIIIIWWBBBM— — —— BBB them here according to some of the authorities.
