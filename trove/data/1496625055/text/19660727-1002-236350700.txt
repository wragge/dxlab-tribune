 Indo-China worth a gamble HPHE reason why the USA are in Vietnam was very neatly expressed by a correspondent in the Daily Mirror recently in which he quotes the New York Times, February 12, 1950:-— "Indo China is a prize worth a large gamble. In the north are exportable tin, tungsten, zinc, manganese, coal, lumber and rice. In the south are rice, rubber, tea, pepper, cattle and hides." He then quotes President Einsenhower, August 4, 1953:— "Now let us assume we lost Indo-China. If it goes several things happen right away. The peninsula would scarcely be defensible. The tin and tungsten we so greatly value from that area would cease coming. So when the US votes $400 million to help that war, we are not voting a give away pro gramme . . ." In other words the US is there because of the /raw materials, and any altruism about free dom, etc. is sheer bunkum. WJ5., (Newcastle).
