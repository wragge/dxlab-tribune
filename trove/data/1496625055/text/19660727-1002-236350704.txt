 Aborigine station hands await talk results JARWIN: Aborigine workers on stations in the Northern Territory are eagerly awaiting the oi tcoLrse of a conference with the Northern Territory Workers' Union and the pastoralists on July 29, a Darwin :orrosnondent writes. This conference will discuss their demands for equal pay with white workers that the Commonwealth Arbitrat ion Commission in March this year, refused to grant for three years. Following the Commission's decision about 80 Aborig ines from Newcastle Waters Station walked off the property and camped at Elliott about 80 miles away. They have not returned to the station since. Feeling is running so high here among the station Aborigines that is is expected that there will be further walk-offs from other stations if at the July 29 conference the pastoralists do not make a definite move for the granting of equal pay.
