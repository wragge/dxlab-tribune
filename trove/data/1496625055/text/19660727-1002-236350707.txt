 Ironworkers' jobs go NEWCASTLE: Over 170 ironworkers will be dismissed fom Lysaght's Newcastle plant between August and the end of the year. The sackings come at a time when there is a general tight ening up of employment pros pects in the district. Many of the retrenched men (some with over 20 years ser vice) will find it difficult to get other work. These new sackings at Ly- saghts will bring the number of ironworkers dismissed by the company to about 1200 since 1958. The dismissals are a result of the company transferring its cold rolling operations to Pt. Kembla, on the NSW South Coast. On August 13 the mill sections are to begin closing down and about 100 men will be immedi ately displaced. The Federated Ironworkers' Association is seeking a sever ance payment of $50 for each year of service for the men dis placed, irrespective of lenght of service. The company has offered $50 to those with 10 or more years' service and $20 to those with over three and less than 10 years' service. Officials of the FIA say nego tiations are still being held with the company on this matter.
