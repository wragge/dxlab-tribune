 The gunless gunman Theatre'': L - - . i ' JJEAN O' Casey's moving account of the Irish "Troubles", "The Shadow f a Gunman", which Pened at the Ensemble Theatre at Milson's Point last week, is the tragedy of a man who knows he's a coward. Because he keeps to himself, all the fellow-lodgers in his Dublin tenement think that introverted poet Donal Davoren j? a "gunman"— a member of the underground Irish Repub- hcari Army, defending the uisb people against the terror- rph of the infamous Black and Tans. "pavoren doesn't have the ho ge disenchant them, -cause he knows that it will ?ss ace- So he accepts e)lV Owning friendship and endures their braggadacio and' —in the case of starry-eyed Minnie Powell — wins their love. During a raid on the tene ment by the Black and Tans, Davoren and his boastful room mate Shields panic when they find that a Gladstone bag left behind by a friend contains IRA Mills bombs. To save Donal, the patriotic Minnie tries to hide the bag in her room, but is caught by the Tans and Donal, hating him self, allows her to be led away, as it happens to her death. James Upshaw's production made the most of the pathos and humour of this classic of the modern theatre, aided by strong performances from a competent and well-balanced cast. Don Reid is sincere and con vincing as the poltroon-poet Davoren, and Don Pascoe — despite an obvious tendency to chase laughs — effective as the pidgeon-Uvered Shields. Lorraine Bayly, however, does not completely avoid the pit falls of the over-innocent part of Minnie. Doreen Warburton turns in an amusing cameo as Mrs Hen derson and Kenneth Laird is good as the drunken Grigson. Full marks must go to pro ducer Upshaw and his actors for their brilliant use of the Ensemble's intimate in-the- round stage to capture and transmit the close and dingy atmosphere of a Dublin tene ment and prove that O'Casey, too, can be done outside the proscenium.
