The Fund is reeded to take the policies of the Communist Party to the Australian people for: e A new foreign policy based on peace and friendly trade in place of war with our Asian neighbours and the lands of socialism. A new home policy of ris ing living standards, rather than rising prices and profits for big business under the Holt Government. Every branch is urged to develop a six months planâ€” NOW. As a basic part of their plan branches are asked to con sider a modest program of two suitable functions before Christ mas to hear a leading Party speaker. Experience shows that peo ple want to hear Party policy and when they understand it better will support it financi ally.
