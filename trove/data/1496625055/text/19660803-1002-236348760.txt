 UNIONS WANT ACTU WAGES CONFERENCE CYDNEY: The 250,000-strong Metal Trades Federation of unions has asked - the Australian Council of Trade Unions to call a federal unions confer ence to consider action over the ' 'unsatisfactory and inadequate" national wage decision, following the MTF's annual meeting last week. Earlier the NSW Labor Council had also unanimously called for a similar confer ence. The MTF said the $2 did not even compensate for increased prices and the deferment of a decision on margins was a fur ther attack on workers' wa-ge standards. The eight metal unions comprising the Federation are asked to make award appli cations to ensure that mini mum award rates are no less than the 1966 Metal Trades Awr.rd decision. Unions are also asked to base their margins applica tions on economic grounds â€” in line with ACTU policy. The annual meeting en dorsed a proposal from the NSW Branch of the Federa tion that a national deputa tion go on Canberra on Octo ber 5. The deputation will demand the implementation of the Australian Labor Party's pol icy in opposition to conscrip tion and the withdrawal of Australian troops from Viet nam. "We consider that this de putation will offer the oppor tunity for many hundreds of workers to play some part in getting rid of the Holt Gov ernment", the federation said. Workshops throughout NSW are asked to elect delegates, and the Victorian, South Aus tralian and Queensland Branches are asked to sup port the deputation. The ACTU's Wages Commit tee which met last week in Melbourne called on unions to apply for an interim increase in margins based on economic grounds. "By this we mean adjust ment for prices and produc tivity while indicating to the Commission that a significant element in economic adjust ment involves a consideration of the under-valuation of skill flowing from the Commis sion's marginal adjustments in the post-war period."
