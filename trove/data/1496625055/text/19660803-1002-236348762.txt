The Peking People's Daily accused the British of opening Hong Kong as a base of the United States. The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam warns that the United States "intends to send tens of thousands of soldiers to Laos at a time when it is intensifying the aggressive war in Vietnam and committing numerous armed provocations against Cambodia." These American plans foi' Laos, the statement added, "create an extremely serious threat to peace." President Ho Chi Minh speaking to a delegation from an international organisation of journalists in Hanoi about the captured American pilots said "It is not the American fliers we took prisoner who are the main criminals but those who sent them into our air space— Johnson, Rusk, McNamara and US imperialist circles. We treat the captive pilots well and will do so in future." On volunteers offered by socialist countries Ho Chi Minh said: — "Vietnam is very thankful to them for their fraternal assist ance but at present there is no need for them. The Vietnamese people relying on their own forces are now fighting heroically and effectively. The question of when and in what form this help may be useful will be given special consideration."
