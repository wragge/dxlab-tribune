 BONN BOASTS - GAS WARFARE kAOSCOW: West German military leaders and monopolies widely accused of assisting American chemical warfare in Vietnam are be coming more open about their preparations for bacteriological and poison gas warfare. The West German military magazine Truppenpraxis features an article entitled "Means of Biological and Chemical Warfare", which shows that Bonn's activities in this field are . well advanced. Colonel Zalyotny writes in Pravda "When reading this article one cannot but recollect recent foreign press reports that Bonn is participating in the American chemical warfare . in Vietnam." Colonel Zalyotny says that a considerable part of the poisonous chemicals used in Vietnam have been produced either by West German firms or under West German licences and that West German firms have constructed their own poisonous chemicals plants in Vietnam. Ivan Shcedrov, Pravda's Vietnam correspondent, in dis cussing West German chemical aids to the dirty war says that 40 miles north west of Saigon he saw for dozens of miles trees without leaves covered with grey dust. The smell reminded him of carbolic acid. The same picture greeted the correspondent and guerillas when they arrived at a village â€” the land around was devastated. Local residents told the Pravda correspondent that Americans began dropping from planes and helicopters what looked like grey clouds settling slowly on the forest, homes, streets and orchards. People began gasping for breath. Many bled from ears and noses. All cattle and crops, vegetables and fruit perished. Shcedrov lists West German-American agreements under which the Germans supply toxic gasses and chemicals and have built chemical plants near Da Nang, Nongshon and elsewhere.
