 THE TRANSPORT SCHEMOZZLE — and Askin asks for more |>|AND in hand with a broken down transport system is the Askin Government's record of broken promises. One of its pre-election baits was that fares would not be raised. Prior to the decimal currency adjustments in January, Sydney and New- castle fares rose by 3d. for 13 of the 27 sections in the fare scale. All fares ending in 3d. or 9d. were adjusted to the next highest multiple of 6d. This fare grab was buttered up with a promise that additional bus travel concessions would be considered when the results of the fare rise could be assessed. Last Thursday the NSW Minister for Transport, Mr. Morris, announced that the concessions for season tickets at a discount in selected areas and a flat rate for pensioners for combine travel on Sundays on any Government transport would have to be deferred. In last week's Tribune, an article by Harry Roberts put the commuter's case for radical improvements in Sydney's run-down public transport system. Below we publish comments by two prominent trade union officials on Mr. Roberts' article — Dr. Lloyd Ross, NSW Secretary of the Australian Rail- . ways Union, and Mr. Pat Ryan, NSW Secretary of the Bus Employees' Union. NSW Transport Minister Morris has also agreed to make a statement for Tribune on the transport situation, and we are also approaching spokesmen for the State Opposition and the Communist Party for their views.
