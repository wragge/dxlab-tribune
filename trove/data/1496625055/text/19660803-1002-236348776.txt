 Margins claims hearing next week CYDNEY: Union claims for increased margins in the Metal Trades Award will again be before Conciliation Commissioner Winter next Monday, August 8. This follows some brief proceedings before the Com- missioner on July 18 when he set out for consideration by the unions and employers some suggestions as to procedures in the "work value" investigation he is to conduct. Proceedings next Monday are likely to be only short and formal. The unions, however, are expected to ask the Commis sioner for an interim increase in margins pending his full investigation. At present margins for tradesmen in the metal Industry employed under State awards in Queiensland and Western Australia are $4.30 per week higher than under the Federal Metal Trades Award. Non-tradesmen's rates are $2.30 and $2.75 higher in the Queensland State Award before Commissioner Winter. With the tatt xhtuity likely to take some time, the unions arc looking for an immediate increase.
