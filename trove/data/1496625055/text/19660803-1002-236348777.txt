 i „ n » a p 4i- f 9 I-bl 1 1 itF=== — — — — I received a letter from Dave Clark of Victoria, whom I mentioned in the column some time ago when he ran second in the Watersider's "Hungry Mile" race. Well, Dave gives us a brief run down on some training methods. He says: "I'll be as brief as possible and would add that this type of training made less severe, that is, cutting down the mile ages I mention, would also be suitable for a young person who wants TO BE PIT. "I consider EXERCISE of great importance if one is to live a full life as is possible— a healthy mind in a healthy body. "AUTUMN— April-May (or if you are just starting). PUN RUNNING— running on . beaches, tracks through the bush and hills. Varying place from day to day running 30 to 40 miles a week and also varying running between 6 miles and 10 miles. At the - same time some body strengthening exercise such as weight lifting— BUT NOT ON THE SAME DAY AS YOU RUN. "For a younger person 10- 13 years: 10 to 15 miles would be ample. REMEMBER IF YOU ARE GOING TO TRAIN WEIGHT LIFTING THIS SHOULD BE DONE UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF A TRAINED PERSON. "For 14 to 16 years the run can easily be pushed up to 30 miles. "Your distance running can . be done alone or with other I runners— it is good to change the pace, increase pace, de crease pace— surge up the hills and slopes — BUT DON'T RACE ALL THE TIME, EN JOY YOUR RUNNING. "Just a few points about this training— running is the basis of all fitness and is easy to do— all you need is some where to run." Dave will answer any ques tions you may have on run ning and is willing to help as much as is possible by mail. Somehow I don't think I could even jog trot 15 yards with the flu I've got, so all flu sufferers will have to start training when we're better, Dave! Dinevan
