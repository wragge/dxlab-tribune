 Publishing I take-over I T5EADERS of J. R. Hughes' re- fl view of "The Invisible Gov- fl ernment", by David Wise and fl Thomas Ross, in last week's fl i rioune, may De mteresea to Know that this book is now out of print and is unlikely to be re-issued. Tribune understands that this is because the publishers, the well- known English firm of Jonathon Cape, have been partly bought out by Sydney Bernstein, the American owner of British Gran ada TV. It is believed that as a result of this change of ownership, Jonathon Cape has decided that it would be undesirable to reprint such a damning indictment of American policy as "The Invisible Government". Tribune has been asked by New World Booksellers, which have received several enquiries for the book since the publication of our review, that the book is out of stock and that they are unable to obtain more copies. We have also been asked by New World Booksellers to state that they have sold out of the Seven Seas edition of A. L. Morton's "A People's History of England" and have only In stock the Lawrence & Wishart edition, whieh sells at $2.30 and not $1.25 as stated In Tri-" bune last week. We regret the error.
