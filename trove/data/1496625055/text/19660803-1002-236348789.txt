An expatriate English actor- uknight (John Gielgud) hangs him self in his swmming pool when Rhis Hollywood studio finally dis penses with his ineffectual ser vices, thus involving his visiting nephew (Robert Morse) in the gruesome business of arranging his funeral. Should be simple, but not in Los Angeles. Morse finds himself in the clutches of Whispering Glades, a multi-million under taking establishment which is cashing in on death by using traditional American business methods of schmaltz, sex and soft- soap salesmanship to bleed grief- stricken relatives seeking to inter their deceased "loved ones". Falling in love with pretty Anjanette Comer as a mortuary cosmetician (she touches up the corpses), Morse takes a job with a pet undertaking firm that uses the same method on animals. Miss Comer suicides when she realises that the millionaire owner of Whispering Glades (Jonathon Winters) — who plans to turn the park into a more profitable old people's home— is a fraud. In a macabre and morbidly, hilarious ending, her remains are blasted off into eternal orbit as part of a new service for the dead fl devised, with the full co-operat- If ion of the United States Air Force, fl to overcome the increasing short- fl age of burial space in Whispering gl ninHptJ Be R.W.M.
