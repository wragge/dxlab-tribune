Mr. Bartos confirmed earlier statements to Tribune, in cluding that while in Vietnam he flew into "Vietcong" territory teams of US-paid assassins who got $20 a head for murdering "Vietcong" leaders. Talking to Tribune staff-man HARRY STEIN, he alleged that many of the US Central Intelligence Agency operations in Vietnam are unknown even to the US State Department The CIA, he said, worked with the various religious sects, the Cao Dai and others. "Any wedge they could drive into the Vietcong they tried to exploit. "One of the CIA agents spent hours at a time building up all kinds of exotic and crazy things to confuse the Vietcong, like leaving ammunition on the battleground that was faulty and leaving weapons where the Vietcong would pick them up and have them blow up in their faces . . . it appears to be the CIA practically directing the whole American effort over there."
