 | Further, hut | net far j j enough j I A STATEMENT by S | Mr. Paul Hasluck, g | Minister for External I j Affairs last Thursday ! I dissociated Australia 1 8 from a call by Air f S Vice Marshal Ky that | 1 North Vietnam should jj be invaded and | | China be confronted j I now. J /' Last Thursday our Par- g _liamentary Round s m a n | phoned Mr. Hasluck in i | 'Perth and asked whether g g, :he would like to comment | T'.on Ky's statement. Mr. | j Hasluck said he would g 2 ; make a considered state- 8 i":ment. 8 I-.r In a statement released j in Canberra later that day g Mr. Hasluck said: "These ! I" statements were made by | j .Prime Minister Ky on his j own authority and the Aus- ? V tralian views are well i | known. I j "We ourselves have ac- | J cepted the need for limit- g J ing operations in Vietnam 8 | to those necessary to pre- | vent communist aggres- g 1 sion succeeding and, while I j supporting the restrained | I bombing of military tar- g I gets in North Vietnam be- 1 J cause of their direct rela- I 1 tionship to operations in g g South Vietnam, we have = | no military objective ex- I | cept to end the fighting in I i>;the South." | j By dissociating Austra- j S lia from Ky's invasion call, g |.T>Mr. Hasluck went further ' ISthan the US State Depart- | ment press officer, Mr. I IRobert J. McCloskey who S p. said he "would not wish | pto comment direct on Pre- g f|mier Ky's call." He added, S p however "Our position of | 2 - not seeking a wider war | J remains." s I Mr. McCloskey's assur- | L: ance that the US does not g gfjwant a wider war has no J ilmore value than previous j PI assurances that the US I j didn't want to escalate the j |->war in Vietnam. g J ; It is clear that Ky is not j IBjust speaking for himself I but also mouthing what at j least one section of the g 1US State Department is j thinking. On other occa- | sions spokesmen for the g 8 Department have flown 8 g kites watching for the res- I 5 ponse. g fi Mr. Hasluck's statement, | | however, makes one thing . 1 clear and that is if Ky's g I call does eventuate then 1 g Australia is committed to | I dissociate itself from it. j
