 Excessive ideology T FEEL that the criticisms of The Realist which have appeared in Tribune are, if nothine else, lone overdue. However, the problem is not a particularly simple one and therefore is not likely to be solved by a few acrimonious letters, including this one. . , . The shortcomings of The Realist lies not in the fact that it uses ideology, so much as in the fact that it uses it excessively and without due regard to the standards of good literature. A political article could just as readily qualify as literature as could a poem, a novel or a short story, provided, of course, it was well written and its in clusion in the pages of a liter ary magazine need not detract from the general standard of the publication. Finally, I want to deal with the most obnoxious proposi tion that one must write down for the workers. It is true that some workers do read comics or confine their atten tions to the sporting sections of newspapers and are there fore not 'given to perusing the pages of literary journals but what of the others â€” the people who buy the best-sellers, in fact the people who make up the vast majority of the read ing public? Are they as illiter ate as some of the pundits of working class literature would have us believe? I am of the opinion that this erroneous attitude comes not from the workers themselves, but from the "blue stocking" pseudo-intellectuals who join ed the movement to "liberate the workers". What we really need is liberation from these snobs. Marx and Engels never wrote down for the workers, yet they appear to have put their views across rather ef fectively.
