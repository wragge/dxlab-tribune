 High costs hit us too By June Mills ""HE Living Standards conference in Sydney 1 i last Saturday heard .many speakers on the . g ! high cost of living. Anyone with experience in 1 I running a house knows how difficult it is to 8 stretch the income to buy all that is needed. : 1 It's not only food, cloth ing and other household costs that have skyrock eted. Costs for produc tion of Tribune have also been affected. So it is good to see that we've passed the $2000 mark— but only just, and if the Fund is to surpass © the $3000 target by the end | of the year all our friends 8 — old and new— are ,spe- | cic.lly asked to remember g Tribune's needs. How are the cent jars going? By now they should be on the way to being full— count those cents and send us in the total. Dollars also are accept able and this week special thanks go to all those who | have sent them in. I Donations this week: E B.C. Lakemba $2, M.
