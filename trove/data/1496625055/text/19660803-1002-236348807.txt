 CPA s funds quest "too, we are not broke, but rising costs and responsibilities to develop our policy means we must have more money." Mr. Claude Jones, a spokes- i uian for the , Communist Party Australia, told Tribune this weex when asked the reasons . for the Communist Party's recently announced, $100,000 appeal. Asked why the Communist farty Is continually appealing 1(?r funds, he replied "The simple facts are that we have no other source of revenue except what we raise from our members and supporters". . Mr. Jones agreed with Trib une that $100,000 was a lot of money to raise by the end of next year. But he said, "this is an election year and like all pol- i ical parties we must spend large amount of money. And unlike all other political parties we have to raise our funds the hard way. "No thinking person has any Illusions that big business provides the money to finance the activities of the Liberal and Country parties and the DLP. "For example, there has been an appeal launched for $300,000 to build a Country Party head quarters in Canberra. One of the main committee members is Mr. C. R. Fisher, the chair man of the US dominated Mt. Isa Mines Co. Maybe this is Mr. Fisher's way of saying thank you to the Country Party Premier of Queensland for his Government's violent actions against the courageous Mi. Isa workers in their epic struggles last year." Asked whether he was con fident that the $100,000 appeal of the Communist Party could be raised by the end of 1967 Mr. Jones said he was absol utely certain that as always CPA members a'nd supporters would respond to the appeal. "They know that the money will go toward the campaign to defeat the Holt Government in the Federal elections, for an independent foreign policy, and for , improved living standards for the Australian people, and to further the struggle for peace and socialism in our country".
