Mr. White declined to serve in the Army although called up because, as he said on the eve of going to answer a court summons on Wednesday: "The National service Act is the embodiment of what I con sider to be morally wrong and I will never fulfill its terms." Mr. White (21), was dis missed by the Department of Education when he refused to comply with his call-up notice. A nation-wide poll of Aus tralian university students last week showed that 68 per cent were opposed to conscription for the Vietnam war.

One of those killed and three of those wpunded were con scripts. In Western Australia, a Ro man Catholic, Danilo Covich, claimed exemption from the call-up because of his religious beliefs, the first Roman Cath olic on record to do this.
