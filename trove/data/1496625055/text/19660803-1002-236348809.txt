 Real leap forward up North 'yHE really big news this week comes from New castle where the four candi dates added a total of some | 67,000 votes to their scores! V Cash, new subscribers and 1 renewals of subs accounted 1 for this terrific effort. From Western Australia, Adam was given a big boost by a combined canvass in his area which sold 50 Tribunes! Rumor has it that Usa, from Innaloo, will get the same sort of help from the same group of canvassers. This is the real spirit of the Popular Seller competition. A little red a-nd green bird tells me Bill Britton's votes get a weekly Friday night injection J from a collection among I clients of a certain well known I Sydney hostelry. (I'm not sure I whether this is a tribute to E Bill's Tribune selling, his sup- I port for the South Sydney Rugby League team or his abil ity to drink beer â€” but it cer tainly helps Tribune!) Maybe other pop sellers would like to take up this idea for a pleasant way to get votes.
