 Stoppage stops pay ploy SYDNEY: A threatened stoppage by workers in three Sydney metal factories last week prevented employers' atiempis 10 aDsorD me basic wage increase in over award payments. The three shops involved were R. E. Jeffries and its wholly owned subsidiaries, D. C. Naylors and Anchor Plate. All three firms, under the direction of R. E. Jeffries, re fused to pay the wage increase to those in receipt of over award wages. A combined protest stoppage was initiated by workers at Naylors and the other two fac tories had agreed to take part. The stoppage was called off when the managements agreed to pay the increase. However, workers at Naylors stopped work in protest against the planned dismissal of workers allegedly due to shortage of work. This factory, according to the management, "has .been non union since 1945." Now the workers say it's 100% unionâ€” and will stay that way.
