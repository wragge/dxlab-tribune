 Unions tell W.A. Govt.: don 't meddle / pERTH: Interference , in the affairs of : trade unions by the De- i partment of Labour and r National Service was j condemned by the WA | Trade.- and Labor Coun- ' cil last week. T.L.C. secretary J. Coleman read a Press release from Lab our Minister Bury about last .month's internal air lines dis pute over pilots' wages. This was an attempt by a government department to in terfere in a dispute between a union and an employer and was a misuse of public money, he said. Council expressed "alarm at fthe continued inroads being .made by the Department of 'Labour and National Service 'into the affairs of unions throughout Australia." It considered that the Dep artment was being used as an instrument on behalf of the em ployers to publicise and pro pagandize anti-union thought. "The recent statements of the jFederal Minister for Labour and some of the activities of the Department of Labour .clearly show that it is being developed into a weapon to smash militant trade unionism and to bolster the employers' policies against the unions."
