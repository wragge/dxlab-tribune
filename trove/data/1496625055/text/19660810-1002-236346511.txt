 The Great Wage Robbery j Prices on the up-and-up By Jack McPhillips AGE robbery resulting from static wage levels and riling prices is again highlighted by a recent further adjustment of the State basic wage in West Australia. Purchasing pawer of this wage is substantially maintained by regular quarterly adustments, the most recent being the 61c rise on August 2. This adjustment was made to meet price rises in the June quarter re vealed by the Statistician's Consumer Price Index. This makes the current State basic wage for Perth $33.26. The unadjusted Federal basic wage for that State is currently $32.80— 46c per week lower than the State wage. . Workers on the lower I Federal basic wage — for example waterside work ers — are subject to the same living costs and must pay the same price rises g.s those on the higher State basic wage. PlIIW'IIIW— w— — — Further price increases will aggravate this injus tice. Had the Federal basic wage paid in Perth in 1953 been adjusted quart erly to meet officially re corded price rises since that date, it would today be $34.30 instead of $32.80. So it is $1.50 lower in purchasing power than it was 13 years ago. But that is only half the story. The accumulated loss suffered by workers in WA covered by the Federal basic wage will, by the end of the current quart er, total approximately $1426. A somewhat similar position exists in Queens land where the current Federal basic wage is $1.70 lower than the State basic wage. Figures published re cently by the Building Workers' Industrial Union in that State show accum ulated loss between Aug ust 1953 and July 1966 to be $819 for each Queens land worker covered by a Federal award. The total loss to all Federal award workers in that State is estimated by the BWIU to equal $57 million. This survey also shows a loss by Federal award workers due to lower mar gins than in State awards of $410.35 between March 29, 1965, and July 11, 1966 — an average of more than $6 loss per week. The absence of regular wage adjustments to meet price rises is a form of wage robbery.
