 '"wyMfinj OVERTIME OR ELSE, CEMENT MEN TOLD IITHGOW : A court order served on 33 tradesmen at Portland Cement Co. by NSW Industrial Commissioner Manuel carries the threat of fines and/ or six months' imprisonment for failure to work overtime. The order, served under sec- tion 25 (4) (i) of the NSW Ar bitration Act, is regarded by union leaders as a serious ap plication of the penal legisla tion when individual workers are threatened with fines and jail while campaigning for higher wages. Commissioner Manuel, at a court , in the workers' meal room, warned the men. con cerned of the penalties for not observing his order! The dispute arose from a joint demand by 140 tradesmen at Portland, Kandos, Charbon and Maldon Cement Compan ies. The men are claiming a wage rate equal to the average being received by metal tradesmen in other industries. Bonus When the claim was served on the companies last Febru ary, a fitter's wage, including his $2 a week dirt money plus $3 attendance bonus was $47.70 as against $52.50 being paid in other industries. The companies offered a fur ther $1 a week on the attend- ance bonus last March and said that if the unions were prepared to wait until June 16 the "workers' problems would be solved". After agreeing to wait, the union official and job dele gates were then told that noth ing could be given because of the national wage case and pending the outcome of the BHP's application for a new Southern Portland Cement Award. Union leaders say that it was clear these companies were un der pressure from the BHP. Following this last unsuc cessful conference, the men went on strike on June 22 and resumed work on July 4 after deciding to continue their campaign on the job. The workers have now asked their unions to press for a suusmmiai interim increase in margins. The unions involved are Am algamated Engineers, Austra lasian Society of Engineers, Electrical Trades, Boilermak ers and Blacksmiths.
