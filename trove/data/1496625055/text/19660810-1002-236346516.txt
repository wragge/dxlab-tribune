 Kosygin 's fresh plea for Sino-Soviet unity OSCOW : "The positions of the socialist community in the world arena 1 would have been even stronger had there been unity and all-round 1 co-operation with the Chinese People's Republic as well," Premier Kosygin I said when addressing the Supreme Soviet in reference to unity of Warsaw 1 Treaty member states for increased sunnort to Vietnam. 8 "Unfortunately all our at tempts to improve relations with the People's Republic of China remain without result", he said. Kosygin noted in his report to the Soviet Parliament that the Chinese leaders and Chin_ ese press were constantly at tacking the CPSU and USSR and added: "These attacks distort the essence of our Party's and State's course and have nothing in common with reality." While continuing to speak about the struggle agains im perialism the Chinese press was increasingly making the CPSU and the USSR the main objects of its attacks and "thus it is obvious to every body, is rendering a big ser vice to the American imper ialists." The CPSU central committee and the Soviet Government, !â€ž added Kosygin, "are convin- ced that the tension in Soviet- Chinese relations runs coun ter to the nature of socialist relations inside the world system of socialism. "In its policy vis-a-vis the People's Republic of China the Soviet Government will con tinue to proceed from the sin cere desire of our Party and people for restoration of friendly relations and unity with the People's Republic on . the principled foundations of Marxism-Leninism and pro- 8 letarian internationalism, "This position accords with the interests of the socialist countries, including the inter ests of the Chinese people themselves, the interests of the common struggle against imperialism, for peace and social progress."
