 YANKS ATTACK CONTROL COMMISSION From Rupert Lockwood AjMERICAN plandi fired shells and rockets at members of the International Commission, military attaches and foreign and local press rep resentatives investigating the American air attack on the Cambodian frontier village of Anlong Trach. Military attaches of Britain, France and Indonesia were among those present. In the village smoke still came from ruins of burned houses and blood was still on bodies of the wounded. As the Commission and attaches investigated, Amer ican fighters attacked them for 30 minutes. Indian and Polish members of the Inter- national Commission called the attack "a deliberate provo cation against the Commis sion." Although he had to hide in a ditch from Amer ican missiles the Canadian representative would not criticise the Americans. The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has branded the attack by B52 bombers from Guam on the demilitarised zone as "an extremely serious act oi escalation". I \
