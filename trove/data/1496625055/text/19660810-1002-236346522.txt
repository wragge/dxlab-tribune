 Persecuting a brave man p. as is reliably reported, the Federal Ministry is unhappy over the case of Mr. William White,, the war-resisting Sydney schoolteacher, and may seek a way of self-extrication, this is understandable. Support for his stand, as a genuine conscientious objector, is growing and will continue to grow. Significant was the Teachers' Federation Council decision last Saturday to arrange for the re-employ ment of Mr. White pending the hearing of his appeal and to guarantee his re-employment after his period of service, if this is enforced. The Council also called on the Federal Govern ment to exempt teachers from conscription. Important, too, was, the weekend statement of tlie secretary of the Congregational Union of Aus tralia that the church would "sustain fellowship" with members who refused on grounds of conscience to be conscripted. , ; In an editorial the Sydney Morning Herald urges a more humane treatment of non-exempted con scientious objectors who have either to swallow their consciences on losing their cases or serve for an indefinite period in a military jail. A military officer was conspicuous in the Court when Mr. White was on trial in Sydney last week, ready to take possession of Mr. White if the : adjournment he sought had been refused arid the Magistrate had enforced the Act- They could submit, him to any "field punishment" permitted by military law or tolerated by the mili tary in practice â€” such as being chained to a stake in a weapons pit or shackled face, down on a stretcher, as was recently shown. The Government ought to repeal this obviously inhuman provision of the Act. It al&o ought to withdraw its court action and stop persecuting a very brave young man. ?
