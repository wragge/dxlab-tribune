 S tin vies ! what guarantee ? There is no guarantee that there won't be any more Stinvics cases, despite the upholding of Stinvics' appeal by the Court of Appeal. William Leonard Stinvics, the slender 9 -stone saw- doctor, was convicted for re sisting arrest, assaulting police and using Indecent language. This was after (according to police) a 20-stone policeman had fallen on him and he had to undergo a serious operation r.t Sydney Hospital. The Court of Appeal ruled that Stinvics had been denied natural justice. They said that he had been cross-examined by a Police Prosecutor using documents to which Stinvics had no access, which was unjust and improper. At a special hearing a cer tificate was produced signed by the Premier (Mr. Askin) who stated that on grounds of pub lic interest a file should not be produced. This was a file of the police investigation into charges by Stinvics that he had been as saulted by the police. If there are to be no more Stinvics cases, special steps will have to be taken to dis courage 20-Stone policemen from falling on NSW citizens. At the moment they certainly have nothing to fear from the normal police investigation. There is no doubt that the people of NSW would sleep a little more soundly if an inde pendent tribunal was estab lished to investigate charges against the police.
