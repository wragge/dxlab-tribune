 A FAMILY AFFAIR QPENING at Sydney's New Theatre on Saturday, August 20, is "Barbara", a new play by well-known Australian playwright Mona Brand. Miss Brand's eighth play to be produced by New Theatre, "Barbara" has as its theme the highly topical "conflict between generations"— today's teenagers and their parents. Set in a typical home in Sydney's Lakemba, the play opens with the family rejoic ing at Barbara's good Leav ing Certificate results. But before long the thinly veiled tensions existing between mother and daughter are re vealed. This is essentially a play about personal relationships, but both situation and char acter are closely integrated with their social background. Barbara's family is "comfort ably off" — they have "every thing they want". But what do they really have, and what do they really want? "Barbara" is designed and directed by David Milliss, in his first major New Theatre production, with Eric Long as his assistant. New Theatre has been able to obtain the assist ance of the Elizabeth Theatre Trust in the full mounting of the play. Bookings for "Barbara" may be made by ringing 31-3237, or calling at New Theatre, St. Peters Lane, East Sydney, where it will run for a limited season on Friday, Saturday and Sunday evenings at 1U5 pm. .
