 Letters to the Editor DALPH Gibcon has IX . . . written an interesting book in "My Years in the Goriimunist Party", which could help to stimulate discussion on the events and times he deals with. His evaluations may assist discussion or they may become folk-lore in the Party. The latter would be a dis-service to further development be cause they are, on some im portant questions it seems to me, one-sided and sometimes quite peculiar.
