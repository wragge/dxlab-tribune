 The gerrymander THE report of the NSW Electoral Commission, gazetted last Friday, will do nothing to stem the growing cynicism of many towards parliamentary life in NSW. 7 . , The simple fact is that on the redistributed electoral boundaries the Liberal and Country Part ies will get 56.6 per cent of the Assembly seats with less than 50 per cent of the votes. Chief Secretary and senior Liberal Minister Willis thinks the distribution "quite sound" â€” naturally. The Liberals could get at least six more seats out of it. Labor will be the main loser. . The ALP-held seats of Dulwich Hill, Redfern, Sturt and Cobar have been abolished while most observers believe that Labor will also lose Drummoyne, Gosford and (pro bably) B,ondi and Wyong through the redistribution. Other Labor seats endangered are Black town, Ryde (renamed Fuller), Mudgee (Burrendong) and Sutherland. Labor is expected to win the new seats of Merrylands, Kembla and Broken Hill. The redistribution has also come under fire from the Country Party which has lost its Casino seat. The result is a weakening of Liberal - Country Party coalition ties and a warning to the CP of further Liberal inroads on their position. J favorable a result for the Government could give substance to current speculations about a new election early next year.
