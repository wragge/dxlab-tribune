 No New Guineans need apply By Jim Cooper "N New Guineans need apply" — could I well be the slogan of the New Guinean Forestry Department. A big development is planned for the Territory umDer industry wnicn couia bring millions of dollars to New Guinea and set it on the road to prosperity. Of it could be robbed o|f its timber, the great profits go ing to the predatory mono polies. It is certainly the policy of the Government to see. that any profits from the timber reserves do not go to the New Guinean people, and if the operation of the Japanese com panies in the Cape Hoskins area of New Britain is a cri terion there will be little in dustry established in the Ter- ritory. They purchase the timber rights from the people and then call tenders for removal of all timber for milling from the area. The New Guinea Administra tion, representing the Federal Government, purchased the timber rights on 110,000 acres at Tonolei, in Southern Bougain ville, for $©0,000. The Forestry Department's estimate of the yield is 500 million super feet. Father Fingleton, a Catholic priest in the district, who raised objections to this, esti mated that the royalties pay able on similar timber stand in Bougainville range from 35c to 70c per 100 super feet. Tono lei timber is highly regarded for veneers and finishings, so the royalty would be nearer to the top figure. Taking a royalty figure of ?uc per j.uu super feet, tne return to the landholders would have been $2,500,000. In other words, New Guinean landholders have been robbed of $2,440,000, less survey and other legitimate charges by the Administration. The Administration purchased 123,000 acres of timber at Go gol River, near Madang, for $60, '900. They estimate the yield at 270,000 super feet. At 50c per 100 super feet, this would work out at $1,350,000. At Sagarai, in the Milne Bay dJstrict, the timber rights of 134,000 acres were purchased for $60,000. A conservative esti mate of the yield would be 268 million super feet, which at 50c per 100 super feet would pay royalties of $1,340,000 (South Pacific Post, July 1.) The timber rights of 28,000 acres at Vanimo, in the Sepik district, were purchased for $2,000. An estimated return of 56 million super feet at 50c per 100 super feet would give a total royalty of $28,000.
