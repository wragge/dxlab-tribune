 Big lag continues in home building Q YDNEY : For years the number of approved ap- 1 plicants for Government housing has remained constant at 82,000, but despite the combined efforts of Federal and State Housing authorities only 1,200 dwellings a year are built, the Federal secretary of the Building Workers' Industrial Union (Mr. F. Purse) told the Conference. "This means that 70,000 ap proved applicants appeal in vain to the Federal and State Governments to have their housing needs satisfied, or on the basis of four to a family, 280,000 people are affected." Mr. Purse also made the fol lowing observations in a paper to the conference: During the year ended June 1965 the NSW Housing Com mission built only 5,482 dwel lings, and at this rate it would take at least seven years to satisfy the current applicants alone. The blame for this situation rests with the Commonwealth (rnvprnmfint. whlp.H H#»tprminps the amount of money advanced. It is also a fact that for every dollar advanced the Com monwealth gets two dollars back— a very lucrative business. The Commonwealth - States Housing Agreement for 1945-55 provided for the building of homes for rental by the States. Pensioners and others in the low income bracket were able to get a house or flat for as low as 8/- per week. This was a good scheme, based on the principle that adequate housing is not only the need but the right of every citizen. The new agreements threw out these principles and the States in the main have dis continued the rental rebate system, placing the emphasis now on home ownership. Generally the position has worsened for families in the lower-middle and low income group. The people in the low income group, those unable to house themselves, are not provided for.
