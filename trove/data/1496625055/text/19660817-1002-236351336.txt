 King Paddy the First By Gloria Sanderson "KÂ«?G of the Sellers", they're calling Mari- time's Paddy King. He's added over 6,000 votes this week and last Sat urday night held a cabaret that he expects will take him over the 100,000 mark. Charlie West, from Newcastle, is emerging at this stage as the most likely rival for Paddy in the competition for national honors, but East Sydney sup porters think their candidate (Dave Baldwin) is the one to watch. I must apologise to the West for a bad slip-up at this end. They sent in their latest figures for publication this week but they've been mislaid here in the office. We will publish last week's tallies in this issue and correct the position next week with the new figures.
