 From Darwin and Numurkah j By June Mills A MOST interesting aspect of this week's donations are the number of contributors from other states and NSW towns. From far-away Darwin readers have sent $4, from Numurkah in Victoria, a town for which I have a sentimental attachment, a reader has contributed $2 and there are donations from Brisbane, Innisfail, Glenunga, Yeppoon. A special mention needs to be made of our friend Butch Wharton, who not only sells Tribune on the street in Newcastle but regularly collects from his customers for the Fund. Meeting with my old friend Wally Goles just by onAidnnf AMA nmhf vnnAnfhr E auviMvJlv V7flv lUgllb X L/UUlfUJ' was a pleasure, but his donation of $20 made the meeting even better. Thank's Wall If such help continues in the coming weeks we 1 should be well on the 1 way to surpassing our 1 target of $3000. | Donations this week: 8 STUC 40c, Dom. per F.O.
