 mil DY a vote of 149 to 64, last week, the NSW Labor Council defeated a move by two printing A unions to change the \ rules to avoid unions being penalised through amalgamating. The result, the new amalga mated printers' union (The Printing and Kindred Indus tries Union) now has only five delegates to Council as against the 10 they previously had to gether. Although many delegates thought the printers' proposals contained weaknesses, they were critical of the fact that no alternative constructive pro posals were put forward by the Council officials to bring up the date the rules which have stood since 1944. Unless this is done, unions will continue to be penalised for carrying out ACTU policy at a time when workers need larger more powerful unions to strengthen their bargaining power. As it is, there are now only 16 unions in NSW with 15,000 or more members. ? rpHE Newcastle Trades Hall 1 Council's Wages and Prices Co-ordinating Committee has called a meeting of delegates and officials for tonight (Wea- nesday) to discuss the Austra lian Council of Trade Union wage demands. .
