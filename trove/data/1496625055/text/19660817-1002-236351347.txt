Four months earlier he had told a psychiatrist he kept thinking "about going up on the tower and shooting peo ple" but the guns were still left with him. Reports Newsweek: "'He was always a crack shot', said his father, almost proudly, later that day. 'I'm a fanatic about guns. My boys knew all about them. I believe in that'." But the "fanatical" father will keep his guns, as will the other owners of the 100 million handguns in private possession in the USA. After Kennedy was shot laws were proposed to con trol them. They were "blocked by the million dollar lobbying activities of the National Rifle Association," says Newsweek.
