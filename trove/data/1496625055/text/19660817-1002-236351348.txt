 NSW UNIONS WANT ARMY ACT CHANGED CYDNEY : The Australian Council of Trade Unions has been asked to press the Federal Government to repeal Section 55 of the National Service Act. Last week's meeting of the NSW Labor Council unanimous- ly agreed to a request from the Teachers' Federation that the ACTU seek the repeal of this section of the Act. This Section "requires that an employer shall not retain in his employment a person who is required to register under this Act and has not registered, or a persor who has been called up for service in accordance with this Act and has failed to render that service." Under the Act, young Sydney school teacher, Mr. William White, has been sacked by the Public Service Board for refus ing to be conscripted. A fine of $200 can be imposed on anyone who employs a per son who refuses to be con scripted. Earlier the Federation's Coun cil decided to ask the NSW Government to arrange for the re-employment of Mr. White until his case is further tested in court. The Federation has also call ed on the Minister for Educa tion to declare as "essential" the service of all male teach ers. Persons exempt from liability to render service under the Act are: Those with a prescribed physical or mental disability. Students at a theological college. Ministers of religion. Members or students of a religious order who devote the whole of their time to the duties of that order. Mr. S. P. Lewis, president of the Federation, told Labor Council that the Act as it stands is more vicious than in any other country. Mr. Lewis said that 150 teach ers are doing national service and next year it is expected this figure will be increased to 300.
