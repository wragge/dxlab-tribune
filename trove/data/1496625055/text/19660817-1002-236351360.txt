 Save us from our 'friends' MERICAN civilians are shooting one another with such determination (50 per day ,'&lt;bn the average) that nobody should be surprised if they carry on the same way (by accident) when they become soldiers in Vietnam. In a single day of last week the US forces moved on from the massacre (by mistake) of Vietnamese in the "friendly" village of Truong Thanh (15 killed, 182 wounded at first report) to an onslaught on one of their own coastguard boats (two killed, five wound- ed.) The very next day they had neutral International Control Commission diplomats diving for a ditch on the Cambodian frontier, when US planes bombed a nearby village (one Cambodian killed — a pregnant woman — and six wounded). For Australian troops this must cause concern be cause it must soon be their turn to come under attack by the enthusiastic but indiscriminate marksmen. And they could be sitting shots; it has been announced that they are to be underV US operational command. q It is well known that the US forces' recklessness in the field with their allies' lives Was' precisely what led to the Australian troops' demand to be allowed to work on their own, without American interference. Now, besides their official "enemies", the Australians will have to alert themselves against "allies" whose established practice is to bomb first and apologise afterwards., ,, Even apart from the "errors", last week was one iiMtsk of the US' worstever in Vietnam: A record number of US planes— 15— was shot down in the north. A curious time for Deputy Opposition Leader Whit- lam and South Vietnam puppet Premier ICy to pre- . diet that the war. will be won in a couple of years. At the present rate it will take that long for our US allies to work out who they should really be shooting at and draft apologies, with compensation cheques, for those they shouldn't. ?
