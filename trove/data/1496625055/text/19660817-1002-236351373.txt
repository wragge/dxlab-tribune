Price 35c. \KJ RITING in the latest "Bulletin", Mr. Brian Buckley — that > well-known expert, on I every pressing problem fac- ' ing Australia, ranging from Oral Contraception to the Yellow Peril — pontificates .at length on what he calls "the magazines of communism, K Socialism and Dissent", which I he evidently sees as a potent force of evil in Australian life. "The Australian Left Re view", of course, rates a mention among them, but Mr. Buckley singles out for par ticular attention the Mel bourne journal "Arena", whose tenth issue has just appeared. Mr. Buckley's sniping attack on "Arena" may be taken as a recommendation of the magazine to all those interested in seeing the dev elopment in Australia of an independent— and indigenous — stream of Marxist thought. "Arena's" aim is to pro vide a forum of discussion and criticism for that con siderable body of Left opin ion in Australia which con siders itself Marxist. Consequently it invariably contains a wide assortment of differing views. Just as those on the Right will take no comfort from its uncom promising opposition to the status quo, neither will those for whom Marxism is a rigid set of inviolable com mandments. The current number con tinues this tradition. Con troversial comments deal with the 23rd Congress of the CPSU and the recent trial f the Soviet writers Daniel and Sinyavsky. In an important analysis of neo colonialism, Bruce Mac- Parlane argues that modern capitalism's continued econ omic and political dominat ion of the underdeveloped world basically confirms renin's theory of imperialism a? earer predictions of the concentration and cen tralisation of capital. Other items of interest- by Adrian Rawlins on Bob yian and Dennis Francis on he prospects of socialist development in Africa help to make "Arena", like "The Australian Left Review", oftial. feeding for all those Marxist and Socialist hue. — R.M.
