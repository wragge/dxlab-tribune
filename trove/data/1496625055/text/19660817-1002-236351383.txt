 NEW BOOK ON OLD THEME SYDNEY: About 200 people gathered in the rooms of the Royal Commonwealth Society last Friday night for the launching of the latest publication of the Australasian Book Society, "Period of Adjustment", by D. H. Crick (pictured above). The book was officially sent on its way by Dr. G. A. Wilkes, Professor of Australian Literature at the University of Sydney, who described "Period of Adjustment" as "a book about the conflict between management and labour". It was very easy, said Dr. Wilkes, to write a bad book on such a theme— "It has been done many times"— but Mr. Crick had succeeded in. writing a good one. Mr. Crick said that his theme of class-consciousness was not supposed to exist. "We are supposed to have killed him off," he said. Yet, he claimed, to-day class was more important than ever. Paying tribute to the ABS, he described it as "one publisher never likely to be taken over." Other Australian writers at the meeting included Cecil Had- graft, Dal Stivens, Ron Tullipan, Mona Brand, Betty Collins Margaret Trist, Mick Staples, Mena Calthorpe, and Marien Dreyer. Former Labor M.P. Leslie Haylen presided.
