 How to hoist Holt IN choosing November 26 as election day, Prime Minister Holt perhaps hopes that resentment against tlie Budget, the rising prices of copper and steel, the Vietnam casualty lists and other consequences of his regime won't have risen sufficiently to bring about his defeat. If the Labor movement mobilises and campaigns as it should, Mr. Holt may be shown to have mis calculated. In many parts of the world the swing is against long-lasting anti-Labor governments. The British Tories seemed to be firmly in power after a 13 years' reign â€” but were ousted in 1964. In France, De Gaulle found his huge majority of earlier elections cut to pieces by. the combined forces of the Left in the poll at the end of last year. Italy's Conservative Government holds on only because the Socialist parties, which could oust it at any time, are divided. In West Germany, Chancellor Erhardt, sponsor of the now-fading West German "economic miracle", received his notice to quit in the North 'Rhine-West- phalia State elections a few weeks back. Now it's the Holt-McEwen Government's turn to face the electors. The electors who hoped that the recent basic wage rise might ease some of their economic difficulties, now; find that most of it has been eaten up with price rises. . To the Government, talk of a crisis in education is nonsense, and price control subversive language. The language they understand is a big increase in military spending sio they can go all the way with LB J. The plan facts are that the Government's policies at home and abroad are bankrupt, and that there are sufficient forces, if they are united and organised, to challenge its existence on. November 26.
