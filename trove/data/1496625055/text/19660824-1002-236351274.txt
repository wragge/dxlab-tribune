 PICTURED is part of the deputation of over 30 young workers who last week presented a resolution to members of the NSW Parliament pin-pointing the urgent demands of young wage and salary earners. It called for higher wages, improved training for apprentices, equal pay, no discrimination against Aborigines and steps to prevent price increases, particularly on goods purchased by young people. The deputation was elected from a recent Young Wage and Salary Earners' Forum sponsored by "Target", the magazine of the Eureka Youth League. M.L.A's who saw the deputation were: Messrs Einfield (Bondi), Kearns (Bankstown), McMahon (Balmain) and Ferguson (Phillip). A letter requesting a reply as to the method of action the Government would take, was given to Premier Askin's private secretary.
