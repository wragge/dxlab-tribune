 Putting the heart into medicine RUPERT LOCKWOOD reports from Moscow on some recent advances in Soviet heart, kidney and cancer research. Dr. Petrovsky gave what were in his view the five main prob lems in reducing human suffering and prolonging life that faced the medical profession â€” 1. Arteriosclerosis. 2. High blood pressure. 3, Flu epidemics. 4, Epidemic hepatitis. 5. Cancer. The freeing of Soviet science from what might be called the "Lysenko blight", particularly in the field of genetics, is obviously advancing Soviet medicine. Accord ing to Dr. Petrovsky research based on genetics is now being intensively pursued in Soviet medicine, with promising results, particularly in virus diseases. A post-graduate student at the Kuibyshev Medical Institute talks to a patient by telephone while watching him through the port hole of a pressure chamber de signed to cure certain blood troubles. Pressure inside the the chamber, designed by the Institute, is three times greater than normal.
