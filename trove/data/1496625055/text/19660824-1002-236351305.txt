 THE UNDIVIDED HEART I would, not trust in a divided heart; A lost bird fluttering between yes and no, A flame in the wind twisting from lust to horror; Salt tears on seeds that will not let them grow. I do not live with a divided heart. One love, one aim, one class my loyalty. I'll face the rain when the first thunder shudders, Keep to the path my people showed to me. I will not write from a divided heart, Nor dig in ashes till my flag is grey. My words are green wheat through the blackened scar, My songs the first red of the blossoming day. Victor Williams
