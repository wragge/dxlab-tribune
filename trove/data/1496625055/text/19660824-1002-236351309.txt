 Private schools rpHE reason why parents send their children . to private and not public schools would be that they consider the children would get a bet- ter education or that they want them indoctrinated to their religion. , Possibly better education is obtainable in the colleges, but surely the parents of children .attending should be expected to pay. , In regard to Mr. Calwells shift in policy regarding State Aid, I doubt that he will get many votes from parents oi children attending public schools. I thing that many parents -will be angry ana there will be, a big proportion of informal votes. On the question of Pu!?11(? schools my opinion is tna "free' schooling is too dear now.
