 Cultural decline WOULD it be possible for Tribune to make a com prehensive survey of the in fluences that are pulling down our cultural standards? Many times I have wanted to write to the daily press about the meticulous detail given to accounts of violence in the newspapers and about the pornographic literature that grows in volume every week. But it is' hard to know where to begin, where free dom to discuss sex and porno graphy meet, how far freedom of the press should allow pub lication of sadistic details. Or where freedom of expression and the emphasis on wrong or low values meet. I have also noticed that American text books are be ing used more in matricula tion and leaving standard studies, most of which are slanted or out and out anti- progressive in the sense of people making history. There are some which are violently anti-communist. I feel many honest parents and other citizens are wor ried about these trends but up to date no lead has been given from any nublic source. W.
