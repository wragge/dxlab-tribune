 Exaggerated, untimely T FEEL that Audrey Blake's criticism of Ralph Gibson's book "My Years in the Com munist Party", is both exag- gerated and untimely. Minor errors and omissions are inevitable in such a com prehensive work. They can be corrected in subsequent edi tions. The book, with its deep sin cerity, scintillating wit and rich humanity held me spell bound from beginning to end. Having taken it up for a cur sory glance, I was unable to put. it. down until I had fin ished. I hope many Australians, young and old, will read the book and that it will run into many editions, despite carp ing critics who were perhaps top close to the events de scribed to properly appraise it.
