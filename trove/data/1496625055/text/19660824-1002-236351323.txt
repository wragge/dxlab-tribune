 WORKERS HIT WASTAGE ON ARMY CAMP SITE YDNEY : About 100 workers from the Hols worthy Army Camp project who marched through the streets of the outer suburb of Liverpool last Wednesday in support of demands for pay in creases, also hit hard at the colossal wastage of public money on the construction site. The combined unions' site committee organised the de monstration in protest against the refusal by the main con- tractors, T. C. Whittle Pty. Ltd., and Leighton Contrac tors Ltd., to pay the workers $12 a week site allowance. A leaflet issued by the com mittee has accused the con tractors, building this $30 million project, of being res ponsible for a "huge wastage of public funds and malad ministration". The workers say this "mal administration and wastage of material on the site could possibly push . the total cost of stage one up by at least one-fifth of the total price." The committee lists the fol lowing examples: Whole brick walls total ling thousands of bricks have been pulled down days after their erection, because they were built in the wrong place. Hundreds of yards of drainage have had to be dug up again because the contrac tors failed to pack the origin al pipes in sand. Widened One whole building had to have all its doorways widened days after their com pletion by the bricklayers be cause the door openings were too small for the prefabricat- ori cfool rlnnr frampe Steel trusses for the roof of the buildings dumped in the paddocks hundreds of yards away from the buildings where they were to be erected another crane was hired to load them on to trucks again to be transported to their proper site. Arguments in support of a site allowance include the isolation of the project and the lack of transport and amenities. Workers say they are being paid less money than paid on numerous other sites where similar conditions existed.
