 The "realism" of the rump |N the forthcoming Federal elections, the DLP will campaign for a "realistic" defence vote. Meeting in Canberra last weekend, the party's Executive carried a resolution stating that the increased defence vote in the recent Budget, while "gratifying", was not big enough and had not solved Australia's defence problems. The resolution, however, may not prove so gratifying to the Liberal Party, which, according to the Sydney Morning Herald (August 22), will need to "channel" substantial funds to the DLP if this pathetic right-wing rump is to make any mark in the election campaign.
