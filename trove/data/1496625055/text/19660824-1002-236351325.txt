 Victoria confident of CP Fund success -&lt;>r the Communist Party s 100,000 dollar appeal we are to raise 24,000 dollars in Victoria", Mr. Ralph Gibson, the Party's Victorian State Secretary, told Tribune last week. "This is a high total for a six-montns period, but we can raise it by the united efforts of our members and supporters" he said. "More than once in the past we have raised a similar sum in the last six months of the year and we must be sure of doing it this time. "The Federal election with its big issues (above all, the issue of the war in' Vietnam), faces us with a challenge. The Party must not be short of the fin ance needed to get its message to the people. In a Federal elec tion campaign we visit more people than usual â€” we reach more people through our leaf lets and meetings. So we can raise funds from a wider circle of supporters. Mr. Gibson was asked, as author of the book "My Years in the Communist Party," about the Party's past experiences in raising money. He said there had always been a generous response to the Party's ap peals. Communists, and many other people too, knew the Party was indispensable in the people's struggle to stop war and win a better life. . "When you look at it over the years, the financial res ponse has been quite a noble one for a party of our size" he said. "Real personal sacrifices have been made constantly by people inside and outside the party." Asked about the response to collections at public meetings, Mr. Gibson said that people in other parties were often amaz ed at the amount per head rais ed at such meetings. "At our best meetings the notes as well as the coins flow freely. Some give through enthusiasm and deep convic tion, others through a genuine interest in the Party's policy and message. "We must arouse that enthus iasm, conviction and wide spread interest through our election campaign in the next three months, and if we do we need have no doubts about raising the money."
