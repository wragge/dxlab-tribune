 Yale Harold Devanny Tribune regrets to announce the death of Harold Devanny who passed away in Townsville at the age of 78. TJ AROLD DEVANNY'S ac- tivity in the Labor movement has been re corded in E. W. Cambell's History of the Australian Labor Movement. Harold Devanny for a long period was the pub lisher of the Workers' Weekly to which Tribune is the successor. As the publisher of the Workers' Weekly he was unsuccessfully prosecuted by the Lyons Government. He was proceeded against by the crown for allegedly soliciting funds for an "unlawful associa tion" namely the Commun ist Party. This was an attempt to establish the de facto il legality of the party with out any formal declara tion. A mass campaign waged by the Labor movement forced the Government to drop the prosecution.
