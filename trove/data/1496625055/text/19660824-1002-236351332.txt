 The Gong comes good By June Mills |F by some good chance we received $69 in the coming week we'd be able to get that lazy fellow with the hammer to knock that indicator up to the $2,200 mark. It would be possible to reach the mark if many of our readers responded to the appeal we ' made some time ago for a dollar for Trib. Fund. You don't have to raise this all by yourselfâ€” ask a friend to help with a small donation. Saturday' night at the Tribune Ball I was sitting next to a fellow from Wol- longong who asked me what work I did. I told him that part of my job was to write this column. "When are you going to raise some money for the Fund in Wollongong?" I asked. Right away I received. $2 donation .from "Xmas Tree" and I hope that other Wollongong readers will respond just as quick ly.
