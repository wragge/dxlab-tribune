 Century of thousands "yHhl big news .this week again comes from the Sydney waterfront — they're over the century of thousands. One of Paddy s committee told me that blueprints are already drawn up to bring in at least 200,000 votes before the close of the com petition. On this basis, plans are being laid for a Maritime Victory Cabaret — you cant say they're lacking in confidence! Charlie West sent in another swag of subscription renewals and cash to bring in an extra 5,600 votes. Dave Baldwin's team are continuing with regul ar canvassing and have held about 10 'consecutive Sunday morning canvasses around East Sydney. Madge O'Grady tells me most of her votes come from people in the Domain who give her money after seeing her name in the popular seller list. If any of our candidates have other vote-raising suggestions, I'd like to publish them in the column to help stimulate ideas among the contestants.
