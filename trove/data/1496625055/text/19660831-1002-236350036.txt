 JUNIOR TRIBUNE gagELLO, Tribune Juniors, Well, how are the school holidays going? Are you managing to catch up on all those odd jobs, that extra study ? I do hope that you will find time to join in cur last week's drawing competition. I'm off on an unexpected (but very welcome week's holiday myself) so I hope there will be lots of your drawings waiting for me when I come back to my office. Do you remember a letter we had from Ivo Fusek of Czechoslovakia? I received another letter from the fam ily and enclosed were the two puzzles for this week. Puzzle No. 1: Find -the two letter "M's" that are the same. Puzzle N. 2. This had me wracking my brains as Ivo says there are nine things wrong with the funny car and its driver — well, Iv6 searched and searched but all I can find is six — but I am sure that you can better thai.
