 MEMORABLE CZECH FILM ""HERE is a haunting quality about the Czech film, A Shop on the High Street, which lingers with you for a long time. Set in a village in Slovakia when the Nazis reach it the story mainly centres around Rozalie Lautmannova, an old Jewish shopkeeper and Tono Brtko, a worker. Tono is basically a decent kind of chap with a shrewdish wife always demanding money and trying to get him to work with the Nazis in the building of a huge tower in the centre of the town which is to be the fascist symbol of victory. Tone's brother-in-law, a local fascist leader, appoints him as Aryan controller of Rozalie's shop which is mainly empty of stock. The Jewish community has con tributed to her upkeep. Rozalie is very religious, very deaf and. completely in the dark as to what is taking place. She welcomes Tono as a young helper, giving him clothes and meals. Completion of the building of the tower is the signal for a wild fascist celebration linked with the rounding up of Jewish resi dents for deportation. It is at this time that conflict arises in Tono. He wants to save Rozalie and tries hard to make her understand what is happening. Failing, he gets drunk to drown his fear of his brother-in-law who has already murdered a "White Jew" (a gentile who helped the Jews of the town). Fear becomes the dominant factor â€” Tono thinks it is a question of getting rid of Rozalie or himself being killed. The highest standard of artistic production, acting and music, all combine to make A SHOP ON THE HIGH STREET a memorable film that should not be missed.- -J.M.
