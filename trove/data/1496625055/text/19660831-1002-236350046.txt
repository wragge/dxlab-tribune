 2. What bombing means From Rupert Lockwood lLjOSCOW: Mass starvation of Vietnamese possibly involving millions is now an immediate threat. The Pentagon has intensified crop and cattle poisoning, bombing of irrigat- ion worKS aiiu DiflnK6t uomuin 01 Svtucu . areas. Documents on captured American fliers show that massive bombing of Red River dykes on whih millions of Vietnamese depend for their survival is high on the agenda. United Press International recently reported that one-third of all rice fields in one of South Vietnam's biggest zones had already been destroyed. Describing American chemical raids on Rathgia and Kantho provinces in South Vietnam, the Vietnamese news agency said that toxic agents poisoned thousands of local people including women and children. Cases of loss of sight and vomiting of blood were numerous among poison victims and the agency adds "the entire crop of cereals and vegetables has been destroyed and the population of these areas has lost all its food." When a 14-year-old boy opened one of the plastic containers dropped in Vin Lomg province he died almost instantly. Evidence of what blanket bombing means comes from Tutri district in Giadinh province where B52's dropped nearly 2000 tons of bombs in an area of only six square kilometres, razing everything. This blanket bombing terror is supplemented by extensive 7th Fleet bombardment of coastal villages. The liaison mission of the Vietnamese People's army has protested against mass arrests and internments of South Vietnamese viillagers by Americans in a new wave of repression. The New York Times estimates that about 4,000,000 of South Vietnam's 15,500,000 will be able to vote in the September "elections".
