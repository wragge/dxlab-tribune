 BUT A DOG'S LIFE! A bit of all right "A WEIRD MOB" goes all- bloody-right! Michael Powell's production of this is truly a masterpiece. He first got the idea of mak ing the film when he read the book on the way back from Ireland. Walter Chiari as Nino is a real character. The people ad mire him all the time. He is always on the alert when the word "Dago" is mentioned. This happens when he is visit ing his girl friend (played by Claire Dunn). Her father (played by Chips Rafferty) uses the word and Nino im mediately reacts. Many of the players and scenes are outstanding. In a way this film is not entirely Australian. Most of the technical work was done by J. Arthur Rank. All cameras and equipment were British. I entirely disagree with Bob Rodgers of 2UE who in troduced all the actors at the second screening of the film when he said the Australian film industry was born again. The Australian film indus try won't be born until:â€” All are Australian actors. Films are produced by Australian producers and directors. All are Australian techni cians behind the scenes and cameras. That this can be done is proven by advertisements for cigarettes in nearly every cinema you visit. One big reason for the de cline in production of Austra lian films is domination of the industry by the American producers during and after the war. At the end of "They're a Weird Mob" thunderous ap plause goes to show the Aus tralian film goer wants more fair dinkum Aussie films. Ron Doyle, EYL Film Dept., Toongabbie (NSW).
