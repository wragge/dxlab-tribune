 One-sided criticism jpOR hundreds of members of the Communist Party who have joined that organ isation in recent years, Ralph Gibson's book "My Years in the Communist Party" will be both enjoyable reading and help an understanding of the early years when the struggle was both hard and hitter. It also reveals the degree of self-sacrifice made in the cause of socialism by mem bers like Ralph Gibson who obviously gave up the oppor tunity of an academic career to become a full-time worker for the Communist Party., I believe that the criticism of the book made by Audrey Blake (Tribune Aug. 10) is one-sided. Certain omissions or errors have already been admitted by the author. There will surely he writ ten in future years a history of the Communist Party of Australia which will deal with the many political and theoretical policies, correct and incorrect, advanced in the course of its existence. But I do not think this was intended to be the role of Gibson's book. I can only hope that the book will have record sales and be widely read by com munists and many others. A.R.A., Sydney.
