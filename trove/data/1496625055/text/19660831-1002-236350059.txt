 Teachers to consider stoD-work JYDNEY : High School teachers throughout NSW will be asked to consider holding simultaneous meetings in school time to protest against bigger classes. This proposal was carried by about 300 High School teachers at their Association and School Delegates Conference last Mon day in Sydney. If the majority of the State's 14,000 High School teachers en dorse this proposal, the Council of the NSW Teachers Federation will consider such action. The protest move follows a forecast by the Education Dep artment that by 1967 the number of High School students will in crease by about 20 per cent. Last Monday's meeting also called on staffs to organise depu tations to State and Federal Members of Parliament seeking immediate measures to help overcome the shortage of teach ers and accommodation. Other sessions of the two-day conference discussed the prob lems in Primary, Technical and Teachers' College education. Last Saturday six young trainee teachers left Sydney on a protest walk to Canberra. They will be joined in the last 20 miles by 50 other train ees who left Sydney by bus yesterday. The trainees wijl protest to their Members about college conditions and low teacher trainee allowances.
