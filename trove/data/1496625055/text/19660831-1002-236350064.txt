 Barometer steady , no change Â¥ DON'T know whether the lines of communication have slowed down but this has been one of the quietest weeks so far in the Popular Seller Com- noHHnn frnm oil ppntrpc With the exception of Paddy King, Charlie West, Dave Bald win, Bill Britton, Madge O 'Grady and Isla, there have been no great changes. However, a very pleasing item of news came my way quite accidentally. Stan Knopman, the candidate from Bondi, is cele brating 20 years of selling Tri bune at Bondi Junction each week. Some of his friends are planning a big party shortly to honor the years of devoted work Stan has done for the paper and hope to raise a sub stantial amount of money for popular seller votes. Yarning about some of his experiences on the stand, Stan says the big thing is to ask EVERYBODY about buying a paper.
