The added financial bur den of registering and policing dogs and other domestic animals has been placed on the limited re sources of local councils. Some Councils -have an ini tial outlay of about $30,000 for equipment, personnel and grounds and then running expenses of about $10,000 an nually. All this will have to be fin anced from purely local sourcesâ€” mainly the $4 or concessional 25c owners will pay for their animals. The State Government has passed this matter to Councils with out any consideration of as sisting by way of financial grants to meet the extra burden. As part owner of a dog (my family is the syndicate, but I am the one who has to fork out the dollars), the question is: "Does my dog get a vote in the next Council elections, or do I . get two votes?"
