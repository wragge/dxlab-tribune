 SHEAHAN'S PEACE APPEAL KAR. W. F. Sheahan, MLA (Lab.) last week in the NSW parlia ment appealed to the Prime Minister (Mr. Holt) to work for peace in Vietnam. He suggested that, in "a con frontation for peace", Mr. Holt should confer with President Johnson in the hope of achiev ing a conference of nations geographically involved in the Vietanam war. These nations should include Russia, which seemed anxious to secure ultimate peace and spxaJ-he world from the ghastly horror of an atomic war. Mr. Sheahan, who was a Cab inet 'Minister in former Labor Governments, was speaking during the Address-in-Reply debate in the Legislative As sembly. He described his appeal to Mr. Holt as "only a snowdrop on the Kosciusko of public opinion, but said his thoughts were in line with those of many other people, including those of many Americans".
