 A modest two hundred By June Mills have some wonderful supporters of Tribune. Ore day last week 1 was busily engaged at a meeting when asked to go into my office, a man was waiting to see me. In. the office was "Old Wobbly" who said "I want to give a donation to Tribune." He was a bit tired from walking up the stairs so I offered to take the money up to the next I floor and get hi,s receipt. I "No, don.'t bother," he said, I "I'll get up there. I've I been there before." Off he went and it wasn't until later in the day I found that he'd donated $200! He'd so modestly refrained from telling me what he was going to give to the Fund. The next good news is we've received our first Cent jar. This comes from North Sydney Branch, CPA, collected over only a few weeks. No-one I missed the few cents they put in the jar and Tribune I Fund received $3.37. More cent jars, please. Tribune seller from Rozelle called in to pay in the money collected, and told me he'd been selling the paper at Rozelle. A very successful morning, with more papers than ever sold and $1.13 col lected in 20c and 40c don ations. So now we're on the way to $2,400 mark. Donations this week: Eddy Ave. $2.50, Trades Hal!
