 ASKINGOVT. 'INEPT, INEFFICIENT AND IRRESPONSIBLE ' The Labor Opposition in the NSW Parliament made a deeper impression than it has done for a long time last week when it brought down a strong censure motion on the Askin Government. In moving the censure mo- tion, Mr. P. D. Hills, Deputy Leader of the Opposition, des cribed the Askin administration as "the most inept, inefficient, and irresponsible Government of this state in this century." The motion was moved as an amendment to the Address of the Governor of NSW, Sir Rod- en Cutler, Who had outlined Government policy. The background to the mo tion was the crisis in education facilities, the fall in the con struction of flats and homes, and the proposed new charges and taxes, that will cut heavily into the living standards of the people of NSW. The opposition moved to cen sure the Government for fail ing to maintain financial stab ility, for allowing prices to spiral, and for not building suf ficient homes. The Government was also criticised for slowing down the tempo of new school construc tion, not training sufficient teachers, and for overloading class rooms, as well as for fail ing to amend /the Landlordd and Tenant Act to allow 5a ten ants recourse to a Fair Rent Tribunal, and failure to com mence any new. works relating to transport facilities. The censure motion was de feated by 46 votes to 41. MLA HILLS Worse than ever before
