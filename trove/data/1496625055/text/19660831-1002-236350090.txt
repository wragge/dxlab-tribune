 LC rules to be reviewed JYDNEY: The NSW Labor Council last week decided that Coun cil officials should re- view the body s rules with the view to bring ing them up to date. This decision followed the rejection of an earlier request by the new amalgamated print ing union that unions which amalgamated in accordance with ACTU policy should not be penalised by a reduced repre sentation to Council. Under the existing rules, the amalgated union (The Printing and Kindred Industries Union) is entitled to five delegates to roouncil -as against five each from the two former unions. In proposing an examination . of the rules, the Building Work ers; Industrial Union has also drawn attention to the present method of electing Vice-Presi dents which differs from ACTU ; procedures. The ACTU elects the senior and junior Vice-Presidents ac cording to number of votes re ceived by the respective candi- dates, while the NSW Council only elects two Vice-Presidents.
