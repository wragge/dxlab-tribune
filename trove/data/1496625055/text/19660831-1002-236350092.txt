(26-2161) iiiniTiim " J THE CHALLENGE OF NEW GUINEA By Jim Cooper The argument of this brochure, fully supported by facts quoted from authoritative sources, deals principally with the rights of the indigenous inhabitants of New Guinea, and with the failure of the Austraiian Government to carry out faith fully its undertakings under the United Nations Trusteeship Agreement. The author believes that the Government has a responsibility to foster the interests of New Guindans-— he opposes the present policy of turning New Guinea into an investment paradise for the benefit of foreign capital. 25c (30c posted) from: I NEW WORLD BOOKSELLERS 42S Pitt St., Sydney — Phone 211-1607.
