 S.C. RALLY URGES WAGE CAMPAIGN WOLLONGONG: A rally of 200 trade union officials and dele gates last Wednesday in Wollongong called on workers in the district to demand and cam paign for a minimum wage increase equal to that claimed by the ACTU in the national wage case. They are claiming a $4.30 increase in the basic wage and a $5.90 increase in tradesmen's margins. The rally declared "we are convinced that only national trade union action, including stoppages, will enable us to achieve our claims". This resolution, sponsored by Messrs. P. Clancy (Building Workers' Industrial Union, NSW secretary) and L. Short (National secretary, Federated Ironworkers' Association) called on affiliated unions to deter mine appropriate forms of action. The meeting said that without neofffina of Tvrinps no real im- provement in living standards or the purchasing power of wages can be achieved- "We endorse the pledge of the Leader of the Parliamentary Labor Party for a referendum on prices and profit control and declare the urgency of the return of a working class gov ernment to the Canberra Treas ury Benches". Mr. Short told the rally that in the Wollongong district over- award payments had been es tablished for all grades of workers other than in the' steel industry and its subsidiary companies. Mr. Clancy spoke of the need to expose the "prices following wages myth". Of the $3.3 in crease in the price per ton of steel, only $1 is related to wage increases, he claimed.
