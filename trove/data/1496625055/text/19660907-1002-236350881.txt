 |a|ELLO, Junior Tribune readers, Well, our holidays are drawing to a close, but it's still nice to be busy and back amongst all of our friends, isn't it? Do you sometimes have a problem about buying a pre- ent for your mends or your younger brothers or sisters? Pocket money a bit short? I was looking at some children's books from the Soviet Union the other day — yes, they are in English and really they would make a lovely gift. Three books in particular caught my eye— "Patchie the Spaniel" — it would be for the 9 year-olds to about 11 year- olds. The coloured illustrat ions are lovely and it seems that Patchie (in the Soviet Union) i,s just like our Spot, full of life and mischief but is the hero of the day. Price 15c. The next one was "Chestnut Grey". This is an old folk tale about a peasant boy and a magic horse — and again the coloured pictures are a de light. Perhaps you already have this lovely book. Price 15c. The last . book is for the Littlies— "Perky Pets" — and is about bears, bunnies and birds. Again the drawings are very good — its price is 20c. So it wouldn't take long to save up and buy one or even two of these books for a present. Perhaps next time you go shopping with Mum or Dad they will take you into the Bookshop in your State which sells these books and lots more— I think they are a very good bargain. Dinewan
