 Unfair treatment LAST December my daugh ter aged 15, and another girl, almost 16, left home one Saturday and were found by police in Strathfield. They were both charged in Albion Street Children's Court with being in moral danger. My daughter was committed to Ormond Girls' Training School at Thornleigh and is. still there, but the other girl was allowed home. I think this unfair and un just when they were both charged with the same of fence, both found in exactly the same place (a boy's flat). Incidentally no action was taken against the boys. Representations I have made to parliamentarians for a re view of the case have brought no results. I think something should be done about such un fair treatment â€” it was my daughter's first offence. (Mrs.) D. Adams, Lithgow (NSW).
