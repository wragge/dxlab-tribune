 Money for 1 sport? I The giant mining 1 monopoly of Mount , Isa Mines in north west Queensland, in its publicity subtly _ 1 . Â« uses tnat town s great following of sport as an inducement to attract employees. The inference is that Mount Isa Mines does a lot for the local sporting bodies. But what MIM | does for the sport of the i local workers and what | the local workers do for j MIM is like comparing a molehill to a mountain. An indication of the cul tural benefits that the working people of MIM and the rest of Australia would experience if the likes of such monopolies as MIM were to be social ised, can be had from the many examples in the Soviet Union. For example, for the recent celebration of Sov iet Miners' Day", the stands of the stadium of the miners' soccer club "Shakhtyor" of Donetsk, the Ukrainian mining cen tre, had been rebuilt anew. Beneath the stands there was a gymnasium, a swimming pool and a hotel for sportsmen. ..ext to the stadium, the construc tion of an indoor stadium for winter track and field contests, is in full swing. At another mining set tlement of Dobropolye a large sports palace with basketball and volley bah courts has been commis sioned. Also, in the Donbas min- 1 ing area, 26 major sport ing facilities are being built. . According to "Soviet News", the central com mittee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Govern ment have taken a deci sion aimed at developing physical education ana sport on an even widei g scale intheSovietUntohjj
