 [?] All we can say is, Last Sunday, Jack Brabham the Australian racing car driver, won his third world motor racing championship. In doing so, Brabham also became the first driver to win the championship with a car of his own makp anj design. "You could say it was an all-Australian effort", Brabham was reported to have said about the win. All Australian sports fans should welcome the win, for not only is it a strong boost for the capabilities 3 of Australian drivers, but I also an indication to the I rest of the world of the technical capability of the Australian worker provid ed he is given the oppor tunity. It may seem paradoxical that Brabham won on a technicality. Not only did his own car have to drop out of the race, but the only other two cars with any chance of beating him for the world title also had to drop out, all because of mechanical trouble. 9 Any worker looking at Brabham's record for the year would naturally enough see it as perfect, inasmuch as it proves the ipoint qf the Australian I workers' ability to not only | drive but to build world I class racing cars. | Players of the final in the mixed doubles of the International tennis tournament held last month at the Lenin Central Stadium in Moscow.
