 March on Canberra By A Teacber Trainee AST Wednesday morning we imet up with the five teacher trainees who had march- 150 miles to Canberra. About 80 teacher trainees had left by bus the night before for a rendezvous with the marchers at the ACT border. We then marched 11 miles into Canberra and met up with the 150 teachers from Sydney. Then off to Parliament House to lobby our MP's and inter view both Labor and Liberal parties Education Committees. We told the MP's we wanted Federal aid for public educa tion and in NSW alone badly needed about eight more teach er training colleges. The Minister for Labor and National Service, Mr. L. Bury, refused to discuss conscription with any trainees, while Mr. Turner the Liberal Member for Bradfield (NSW) wouldn't see anybody from the Teachers Federation as "It was a biassed organisation," Victorian Railways Union secretary, Mr. Jack Brown, speaking at the Williamstown meeting.
