 Insensitive . WaBâ€” . critic TTOW could Roger Milliss be so insensitive as to refer to the poems of Victor Wil liams in. "HAMMERS AND SEAGULLS" as "a mixed bag"? The poems . are of high quality and to single out lines that were not represen tative of the finest, in my opinion, was more damaging to the critic than to the rep utation of the poet. I believe, as Mathew Arn old said, that "a generous en- ; thusiasm" is characteristic of a literary critic who has an innate sense of values. Like Eluard and Aragon, the French poets, the com munism of Victor Williams has become so much part of him that it informs his poetry as naturally as his thought flows. He is able to find "imaginative significance in everyday things", as Furn- ley Maurice did; but to', con sider this as so reactionary that it may be regarded as anti-poetry, "from the literary point of view", seems to me is the sort of comment we would expect from a bour geois critic, but not. from a reviewer of Tribune. Anoiner critic, quaiiitea as to literary values, . wrote to me: "The poems in "HAM MERS AND SEAGULLS" are magnificent. I haven't been , so excited by any book of poems for a long time." This is the reaction I antic ipated from a poet who has a fundamental appreciation of socialist and literary values. Katharine Susannah Prichard, Perth.
