 Mounting action at price grabs MELBOURNE Steep price rises and the threat of I more to come brought Melbourne's biggest suburban demonstration and Bendigo's largest union rally for many years last Friday. At Williamstown nearly 5,000 people converged on the Wil liamstown Town Hall at 11 a.m. for a meeting called by the Williamstown Living Standards Defence Committee. Thousands of workers marched along the main street with banners pro testing against erosion of living standards. Workers from about 15 fac tories in the district stopped work to attend the meeting. They included the big Newport and Spotswood Railway work shops, Williamstown' Naval Dockyard, Hobson's Bay Dock and Engineering Co., A.C.I. Glass works, five petro-chemic- al plants at Altona, and several other factories. Tugs in the port stopped while seamen marched to the meeting. Speakers included Mr. L. Floyd, M.L.A., for Williams town, Railways Union secretary, Mr. J. J. Brown, and Mrs. S. Proctor of the Combined Pen sioners' Association. The meeting unanimously passed a resolution calling on the trade union movement "to hold a mass demonstration in Melbourne to prevent Bolte from proceeding with a budget of new super taxes and prices on the Victorian people." . The resolution condemned constantly increasing prices and taxes which act as a direct wage, salary and pension cut. "You are getting a dirty deal", Melbourne Trades Hall Council's industrial officer, Mr. R. Wallace, told 1000 workers demonstrating against rising costs in Bendigo. Mr. Wallace accused the Gov ernment of having done nothing about rising prices which had hit ordinary families. "But the Government did plenty to protect the shares of their friends who had put them in power", he said.
