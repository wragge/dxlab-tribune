 Is THIS obscene...? ...OR JUST PLAIN DISGUSTING? . . . But that's the way our allies treat their prisoners in Vietnam. This photo was originally published in the daily press, reprinted in Gerald Stone's hook, "War Without Honour" and used in Tribune some weeks ago. But a pamphlet entitled "American Atrocities in Vietnam" was seized by Melbourne police last week and the publishers tho Vietnam Action Committee, have been threatened with prosecution for "obscene libel", because the publication contained this and two other photos showing American brutality in Vietnam. The police action immediately brought extensive protests. Dr. Ian Turner, Senior Lecturer in History at Monash University, described it as "an outrageous and stupid act of political censorship". A group of Melbourne clergymen declared that they would sell the pamphlet in the city streets. Meanwhile) the Vietnam Action Committee has stated that demand for the pamphlet is so great that 4000 have already been sold, and that another 5000 are being printed; A mass sale of the pamphlet is being arranged in Sydney on Friday. Volunteers are asked to contact the office of the Australian Association for International Co-operation and Disarmament.
