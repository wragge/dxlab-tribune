 A few frank words to Harold QYDNEY: The Buildink Wor kers Industrial Union has called on the Holt Government to completely change its pol icies as the "only way to enable Australia to develop its econ omy, provide better living standards, public service and social services and develop mutual trust and good relations with other nations". In an open letter to the Prime Minister, the union said the Government's policies have resulted in or contributed to: Inadequate works and housing .programs. ' A decline in social ser vice standards. Unbridled price increases and virtual wage pegging, causr ing lowered living standards. The fostering of mono polies, both national and for eign. The alienation of Austra lia's natural resources, includ ing the very rich mineral de posits. Growing penetration of Australian industry, commerce and agriculture by foreign cap ital. ® The economy being turned into an economy heavily ac cented on war. Interference by armed force and otherwise in the internal affairs of other na tions, as in Vietnam, where Australian youth is being sac rificed in accordance with your "all the way with, LB J" policy' and where the Vietnamese peo pled only "crime" is that they want to run . their own country in their own way. ® A complete failure to pro mote the cause of peace in the Councils of the Nations and in developing mutually friendly relations with other countries.
