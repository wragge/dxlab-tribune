 [?] REFUSING to go to Vietnam because they considered the war there "immoral, illegal and unjust" these three US soldiers have won wide support for their stand. They are (from left) Private Dennis Mora (a Puerto Rican) who last week was sentenced to three years' jail, Private David Samas (of Lithuanian origin) and Private First Class James Johnson (a Negro). "We have made our decision" they stated "We will not be part of this unjust, immoral and illegal war. We want no part of a war pf extermination. We oppose the criminal waste of American lives. We refuse to go to Vietnam."
