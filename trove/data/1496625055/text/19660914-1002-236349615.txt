 COMMUNISM IS NO GOOD From Harbin I came,' from my carpet factory, Chinee labour was cheap as a plate Of uncooked rice, my home was not palatial, But it was very nice, in the evening I could see The barges on the river, in the winter The coolie kids would stand and shiver, I have left my fortune in China. The new government told me: "Stay and work, Or go and leave the dough." I left. Believe me COMMUNISM IS NO GOOD. From Cairo I came, where I left a block Of twenty shops, I did not have a fortune, But I also did not eat the slops, when the hot sun Burned down in May, I would hear the people say, He has got his money by stretching our arms And our guts. I used to think: Yes, but without Me, there'd be no cuts of camel rump, not even The liver of a tabby cat to eat, without me, I I used to say, the Arabs would be beat. Then, one day, Nasser told me, you are going Away, but we didn't buy a ticket for your doughrey, That stays. They cut up my land as well. Believe me COMMUNISM IS NO GOOD. I left Budapest or 'Pest in 1945, you see The army with the fur-collar coats surprised Me, I didn't control all the blackmarket In 'Pest, just sold a few lines that were scarce, The best cognacs and champagne for the Uber-puppen- Fuehrers back from weeks of fighting in the snow, And, of course, silk stockings for the officers' Girls, the SS kept the parties rocking, then, What do you know, these soldiers with the fur- Collars bounce me about and say: Listen Mac, Where did you get all the dollars, (or sloties in Hungarian), you'd be about the biggest pest In 'Pest. Now, how will you take it? Eating corn and smoking twist, or . . . Ivan, I said, I know where I can go, Australia, I'll take it on the toe. And so I lost all my Possessions, property and wealth. Australia's The best country in the world, but, believe me, COMMUNISM IS NO GOOD. Denis Kevans
