 Hands off Reserve TT will be the people versus bureaucracy at the New castle City Hall on Wednesday, September 21, when a public meeting will be held to pro- test against the Main Roads Board decision to route a six- la.ne highway through Black- butt Reserve and to have the City Council reverse its endorsement of the highway. Protests are pouring in from the Communist Party, ALP and the Liberal Party and from progress associa tions and other bodies. Letters of protest appear daily in the press and appeals are being made to the Minis ter for Local Government and Highways and the Premier (Mr. Askin) calling for their intervention to save the re serve by having an alternate route chosen for the high way. Blackbutt is a 300 acre area / that has been dedicated a reserve, only four miles from the centre of the city, and is ideally suited for devel opment of botanical gardens, picnic grounds, koala regen eration park and a rain for est, with bush-walks and rid ing tracks. It is a natural habitat for birds and is rich in Australian flora. . The city Council's endorse- " ment of the highway through the reserve, which will de stroy the plans agreed upon for its development, has aroused irate feelings among the people that will be vin dicated by united action at the public meeting in the City Hall on September 21 in sup- port of the battle cry "Hani ' off Blackbutt Reserve." | M.
