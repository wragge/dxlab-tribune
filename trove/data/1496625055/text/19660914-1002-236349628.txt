 Pensioners' dependent's m— — MIIMJU.U.ILU.— P— — rpHERE is certainly nothing illogical about the deci sion by the Federal Treasurer, Mr. McMahon, to increase the rate of social service pension- ers income as outlined in the Budget. What troubles me is, if it is deemed necessary to in crease adult pension rates to cope with the rising cost of living, then surely it is illo gical not to also increase the living allowance rate paid in respect of pensioners' depend ent children. The fact that there has been no increase in the rate of dependent children's allow ance since 1961 suggest that perhaps as non-voters they can ero iumn in the lake. H. Gould, Mona Vale (NSW).
