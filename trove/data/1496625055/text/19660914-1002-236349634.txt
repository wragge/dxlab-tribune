 Holt's alien cynicism STATEMENTS by government leaders less than two years ago show that the Holt government has cynically broken promises and thrown overboard its own stated principles on the conscription of un-naturalised migrants In Federal Parliament on November 17, 1964, the then Minister of Labor and National Service, Mr. McMahon said: "Under the rules of International Law, aliens are not and should not he liable to service in the armed forces of a country other than their own without the consent of their own government. "In what is called the comity of nations, we accept that we should not call up aliens and similarly, other nations accept that they should not call up aliens for their fighting services. "We want migrants and we are not prepared to offend the governments of the countries from which they come." The government now denies that questions of international law are involved. And despite protests from the governments of Italy and Greece, Prime Minister Holt intends to press on with the scheme. Intending migrants are said to be warned of difficulties of integration into the Australian way of life before leaving their mother countries, but no warnings of the likelihood of conscription for Vietnam have been given. Sir Robert Menzies, then Prime Minister, said on the same subject on November 11, 1964: "The fact in relation to aliens is that we do not propose j to apply to them, they still being aliens, any compulsory j conscription except that they will register and if called I up they will, on establishing the fact that they are aliens j be indefinitely deferred. They will not have this duty I imposed on them while they are aliens." I Migrants have opposed conscription of aliens as an extension of a policy already opposed by large sections oÂ£ the Australian community. Many have stated their readiness to defend Australia if she is threatened, but like a lot of Australians, are not prepared to fight the Vietnamese people.
