I expect Saints to win their eleventh successive premiership, but the mar- I . gin will be small. 0 Balmain selectors should provide their Reserves with every opportunity to win by not keeping fresh replacements on the side line for their Firsts. During the season, this practice was not allowed and Balmain had to use players who earlier had played a hard game and then excelled their Res erve grade form as replace ments. Young players like John Spencer, Gary Leo, Sid Connell and Sid Wil liams, showed the benefit of playing along-side first graders. Providing . Beetson has recovered, he and Piper should be the props, with Boland to hook leaving the youthful Tutty and Leo in the second row, Dave Cooper justified his promotion by playing well in the. open, but Bo land proved he is the best available hooker Balmain has. This assures the re tention of Leo, who is fast, fit and ken— essentials for the Grand Final. At the end of last season, I advised Sydney clubs in search of a good hooker, to hotfoot it to Brisbane and sign Elwyn Walters. South Sydney landed him and must be very pleased with their buy with his strong general play and consistent goal kicking.
