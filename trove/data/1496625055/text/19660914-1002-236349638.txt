 Vote out conscription A S an Australian worker and World War II ex- serviceman I feel it is the duty of all conscientious peace-loving Australians to go to the Commonwealth poll in November and emphatically end conscription of Australian I manpower for military service overseas, whether conscripts are voteless youths or adults. There is no doubt that the aggressive campaign against !the Vietnamese people of both north and south by US, Aus- i tralian and other forces is | morally wrong and the des- ! truction of life and properly I there emphasises the callous j nature of the war against a ! people striving to obtain their I independence and freedom | from American domination. j Conscription is an ugly blot j on Australia. In 1916-17 it was ! defeated. Australians took 1 part in two world wars with- 2 out it and I hope that in the ! elections it will be defeated I for all time. k" I urge all peace-loving Aus- tralians to demand the with drawal of troops from Viet nam and allow the people to determine their own way of life free from foreign inter ference.
