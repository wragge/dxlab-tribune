 GOVT. PLAN NEEDED tO PRESERVE HARBOUR Letters b fo the Editor COMPARISONS b e- tween the Federal Government's planned approach to the devel opment of Canberra and the; way efforts by Local Government authorities to , .preserve the natural beauties of Sydney are ignored were made at a meeting of mayors of North Sydney, Mosman, Willoughby, Lane Cove, Hunters Hill, Manly and Woollahra. The meeting supported the view expressed by Mayor H. V. Parkinson, of Mosman, who was reported in. the North Shore Times as saying "that the Federal Government should show the same en lightened approach to the de velopment of Sydney Harbor which has characterised the development of Canberra". A resolution carried at the meeting is aimed at having the three levels of government (Local, State and Federal) plan "the urban environment in which at present 60 per cent o'f- Australians reside". It calls on the Commonwealth Government to maintain the closest liaison with State arid local planning authorities to ensure all its proposed devel opment schemes conform with lo.cal and State planning schemes, and continues : "In view of the large areas of land which it owns ori the foreshores of Sydney Harbor, the Commonwealth should immediately consult with the State Planning Authority to evolve a plan which would have regard: for .the preser vation of the natural beauty of the Harbor." It is reported that the Pre mier, Mr, Askin, is arranging a meeting between the seven mayors and Prime Minister Holt to discuss these issues. Undoubtedly the decisions of this meeting will have the support of large numbers of Sydneyites who are appalled at the ruthless way our once beautiful harbor is being de spoiled by the erection of huge, ugly concrete buildings on its shores. Support for the ideas of the seven harbor-side councils should be forthcoming from locjal organisations such as progress associations and others interested in a planned development of Sydney sub- nrkifi J.
