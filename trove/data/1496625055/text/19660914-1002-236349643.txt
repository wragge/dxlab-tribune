 Mary Gilmore Award A TRIPLE dead-heat has been the result of the 1966 Mary Gilmore Award — this year for poetry. As the three judges— Mona Brand, Roland Robinson and Leonard Teale were unable to reach agreement on a first prize-winner, it was decided to divide the $100 prize money between the three finalists. The joint winners are Anne Holman of Vale Park (S.A.) for "Australia and the Universe", Anne Pickburn, of North Melbourne (Vic.) for "Winter Fragments", and Donald Sanger, of Wollstoncraft (N.S.W.), for "The Dream and the Act".
