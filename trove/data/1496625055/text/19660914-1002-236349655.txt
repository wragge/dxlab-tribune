 Roving controllers disbanded ROUGH JUSTICE FOR LOW RENT TENANTS the disbanding of the team of roving rent control inspectors by the NSW Government is a further sten toward endirnr rent control. It follows recent 'Cabinet decisions which will be pre- sented to Parliament shortly, further curtailing tenants' rights, such as allowing land lords to evict tenants without providing alternate accommo dation. The job of the roving inspect ors was to make check calls at premises to see whether ten ants were being overcharged. The Minister for Justice, Mr. J. C. Maddison, said last week that a Department organisation and method team had suggested that the roving inspectors should be disbanded. There had also been com plaints abput the activities of the roving inspectors, he said. Asked at a press conference last Thursday where the com plaints had .come from, Mr. Maddison said that the com plaints had come from the landlords, and then added "and some tenants". Mr.- Maddison said that the investigation section of the Rent Control office would con tinue to investigate written or verbal complaints. Control The former roving rent in spectors would now set to work on a survey to find out how many tenants were still covered by rent control. The Government would use the findings of the survey to determine its future policy to wards rent control. Asked whether he saw the rent control system and the rent control office going out of ex istence after the 1968 elections, Mr. Maddison replied; "I can't tell you at this stage, I may be in a better position when I see the number of ten ants still covered by rent con trol. But in the long term rents must be brought up to date." It is absolutely certain that unless the tenants under rent control organise and support the action of the Labor Oppo sition which in parliament has been consistently fighting to retain rent control, then what remains of rent control will be abolished.
