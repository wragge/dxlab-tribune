 Racist clique So Mr. Holt is sorry that "questions of race" have been raised at the Commonwealth conference. He doesn't see anything racialist or disruptive about his' own defence of the Smith anti- African tyranny in Rhodesia. He has been trying as desperately to stop African action against Smith as Menzies, earlier, tried to stop it against Verwoerd after Sharpeville. It seems likely, he is backing the reported Wilson move to recognise Smith's government, defying de mands for prior guarantees of majority rule in Rhodesia. Such a move could provoke an African- Asian walkout and reduce the once mighty Empire and Commonwealth to a clique of white-supremacist governments. That Wilson and Holt would rather have this happen than see strong action against the Rhodesian racists shows just how much value they really attach to the democratic ideals for which the Commonwealth is supposed to stand.
