 Call for TU support for stockmen strikers jygELBOURNE: The decision of the powerful Meat Industry Employees' Union Federal Council to instruct its 40,000 members ' not to nanc.ie or treat cattle trom two big Northern Territory cattle stations gives vitally important support to Abori gine workers on strike there. The Council made this deci sion last week-end. The Federal Council of the Waterside Workers' Federation last week in Sydney called on the whole trade union move ment to support the striking Aboriginal stockmen at the Wave Hill . Cattle Station in the/ Northern Territory. About 200 Aborigines, em ployed on low wages by Vesteys, the British meat monopoly, went on strike in support . of their demand for award wages. Aborigines at the Newcastle Waters Station earlier . went on strike in protest against wage discrimination. The Federal Council last week donated a further $500 to assist the strikers. General secretary of the WWF, Mr. C. Fitzgibbon, said the Federation has now given the strikers at both Newcastle Waters and Wave Hill $1500. Spearheaded "The Struggle of the Abor iginal workers of the North ern Territory through the North Australian Workers Union and spearheaded by the Aborigines of Newcastle Waters and Wave Hill is an ex pression of the growing de mand of these indigenous Australian people for equal status and rights in all as pects of community life," the the WWF said. "Their demand is only for justice. Their fight must be supported by the whole of the organised trade union movement." A resolution called on the Australian Council of Trade Unions to consider issuing a proclamation of support and to condemn the Arbitration Commission's decision which denies Aboriginal stockmen full wages until December 1968. "Neither the Commission nor the Federal Government will stop the Aborigines in their march to equality," the WWF said.
