 YOUNG MAN IN THE MACHINE AGE Apprentice fitter Ron Anderson is a model of concentration as he works on a lathe at North Sydney Technical College. The Australian Council of Trade Unions is running its third Trade Unions' Youth Week from September 12 to 14 to demonstrate to young workers like Ron the benefits and importance of trade unionism. Some young safe- driving unionist will win a new Holden just for showing special care on the roads. Who knows? It could be Ron.
