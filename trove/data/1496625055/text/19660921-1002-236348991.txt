 Q'land TLC attacks GMH claim decision gRISBANE: The Fed eral Arbitration Commission's refusal of General Motors-Holden workers' pay claim "is a challenge to the Aus tralian Council of Trade Unions and the Aus tralian trade union movement." The Queensland Trades & Labor Council executive said this at a meeting on Thurs day. It said also that this chal- lenge must, sooner or later, be met. The executive strongly con demned the Commission's re fusal to grant the $6 a week for GMH workers, as claimed by the unions under the ad vocacy of the ACTU. The executive also condemn ed the system of arbitration which admits a monopoly's capacity to pay but which does not decide that workers should get a share, by wage increases. Such a method of arbitra tion, the T&LC executive said, permits huge monopolies to make still higher profits at the expense of workers and the country. The T&LC's views on the action which should be taken to win at least the $6 for GMH workers will be put to the special meeting of the ACTU executive in Melbourne next week.
