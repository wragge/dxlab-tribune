 ' - », I !#»" ON TH K INDUSTRIAL SCENE m CLERKS RESIST SECRET NCC TAKEOVER BID JYDNEY : The NSW Central Council of the Clerks' Union in Sydney recently overwhelmingly opposed the secret moves being made to secure complete National Civic Council control of the union's federal leadership. This control is being planned through a change of rules which was recently forced through the Union's Federal Council. Federal President J. Maynes (also Victorian Branch president and a rabid NCC man) is seen by clerks as the main architect of the planned coup. The changes to rules were carried out without prior notices to Branches as required by the old rules. The present scheme has completely re-constituted the federal leadership of the union, depriving most Branches of democratic representation on leading bodies and to stack these bodies with NCC supporters. A new office of Deputy President has also been created and given to a Mr. Thornton, the Brisbane manager of the Santa- maria's News Weekly. Opposition by the NSW Branch is regarded by clerks as a serious set-back to the NCC plans, as this branch has always played a key role in the union. The NSW Council, which supported Secretary P. O'Toole's opposition to the rules changes, also pledged that the . NSW Branch would - work to defeat the conspiracy and restore democracy in the union. The stand taken by NSW now brings the majority of the Branches into outright opposition to the NCC forces in the union. Federal secretary, J. Riordart opposed the moves for NCC control, as did federal councillors from the majority of the branches. However, Maynes had- block votes- from the NCC— dominated Southern Queensland, West Australian and Tasmanian branches oi the union. . These votes, added, to that of the Assistant Federal Secretary,: Sullivan, and the defection of- NSW assistant secretary Higgins to the NCC, gave him the bare majority needed to carry his scheme at the Federal Council through.
