 Real terrorism in the Yanks ' own backyard %AAHILE the USA tried to convince a sceptical world that it is combating ' "Communist terrorism" in Vietnam, real terrorism was being inflicted on its Negro citizens in its own back yard of Mississippi. Negro children who attend- ed a hitherto all-white school in Grenada, Mississippi, were shamelessly bashed by white hooligans. White men armed with clubs, chains and axe' handles attacked and beat up the Negro youngsters. Boys were thrown to the ground, kicked and beaten. One lad of 12 had his leg broken. Police stood by and .made, no move while young Negroes ran the gauntlet, their faces torn and bleeding. President Johnson who can spare 300,000 men to ' stop "terrorism" in Vietnam, could not spare a company to pro tect these American young sters; In this country which is out to teach Vietnamese the meaning of freedom and de mocratic rights," even today only 10 per cent of its south ern Negro children attend in tegrated schools. Elsewhere in the USA, in the past two weeks, acts of "aggression" against Negroes included: In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, whites hurled bricks, rocks and crackers at peaceful Negro demonstrators, scream ing "Burn, Blackie, burn!" "Kill the jungle bunnies!" e In. Dayton, Ohio, white men raided the home of Negro Leicester Mitchell and shot him dead. In Atlanta, Georgia, a white man and woman in a car drove up and shot dead two Negroes standing on a street comer.
