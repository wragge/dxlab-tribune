 [?] . . . Certainly not Richard Burton, as he gets his fingers round his beautiful real-life wife's neck in a scene from the brilliant Ernest Lehmann screen version of Edward Albee's "Who's Afraid of Virginia wooiir' now -snowing at ayaney s King's Cross Metro. Miss Taylor, who effectively disposes of . the widely-held opinion that she really can't' act plays the gin-sodden wife of an undistinguished History professor — beautifully underplayed by Burton — whose twenty-year marriage is a debilitating process of vituperation, self-laceration and mutual recrim ination, interspered with the playing of fanciful and destructive games in an attempt to escape from the "unreality of life". After a fantastic night of booze and abuse with a young Biology lecturer and his child-like wife, newly arrived on the I University campus, Burton and Miss Taylor are drawn together again by the firm threads of familiarity. Albec seems to be saying that life and human relationships are based on mutual destruction and cruelty, that it is virtually impossible at times to tell the difference between truth and illusion, and that only the habit of routine basically keeps people together. His world is negative and pretty depressing, but "Virginia Woolf" Is worth seeing for its bristlingly witty dialogue, the superb acting of its four-man cast, and its not infrequent deep flashes of insight into human affairs. As the biology lecturer and his wife, George Segal and Sandy Dennis are as good as— if not better than— the two famous stars. R.M.
