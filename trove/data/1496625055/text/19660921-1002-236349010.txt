 gYDNEY: A mass meet ing last Monday of over 2,000 workers (Pic tured) at Homebush Ab attoirs refused to end their strike until two sacked Meat Union dele gates are reinstated. The strike, which now involves 15 unions, began after the delegates were sacked for insisting on their right to be present during the interrogation of a member. The decision to remain on strike was taken in op position to a Labor Coun cil Disputes Committee proposal to return to work and that the matter be taken to the Crown Em ployees' Appeals Board. A resolution called on the Labor Council to de clare the abattoirs black for all meat both in and out except for hospitals and institutions. Workers are hostile at the long history of the Meat Board's anti-union activity. A recent strike occur red when the chairman of the maintenance union delegates committee was relegated to another job. On that occasion the men returned to work on the promise that an appeal would be sympathetically consideredâ€” but was not. Had the disputes com mittee proposal, been ad opted it would have meant at least a month's wait before the Appeals Board would hear the case.
