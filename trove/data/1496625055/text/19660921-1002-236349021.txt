 TWO QUARTERLIES I OVERLAND, No. 34, Autumn, 1966; THE REALIST, No. 23, Winter, 1966, JUST how concerned Aus tralian writers and intel lectuals — not to mention the general reading public — feel about the Vietnam war is shown by the latest issue of Melbourne quarterly Over- land. In addition to reprinting the statement signed by 58 lead ing writers asking the Feder- overnment to discontinue the despatch of conscripts to. Vietnam — also published in the current Realist— it con tains a number of first-rate articles on the subject. Professor C. P. Fitzgerald analyses the dilemma of Ame rican policy, Phillip Adams eports — not very encourag ingly on the reactions of a group of Melbourne office : workers to the war, Len Fox j writes of Vietnam as a "nat- j ion of poets", and Tony Mor- : phett contributes a poignant ! story. j The Winter issue of The j Realist also contains a num- ; ber of items of interest, featuring Opposition Leader A. A. Cal well's tribute to Dame Mary Gilmore at last year's meeting commemorat- . ing the centenary of her birth last year. Sensitive stories come from Janet Chalcot and Gordon Adler, Hilton Barton con cludes his study of the devel opment of The Bulletin, and Wilma Hedley surveys the Adelaide Festival of Arts.
