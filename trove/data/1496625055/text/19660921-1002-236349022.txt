 Suggestion for SEATO A SUGGESTED additional Article No. 12 for the SEATO treaty: Whenever or wherever in- digenous people of a- country revolt against the govern ment — regardless of what ever conditions may prevail in that country these people, seeking humane and civil im provements — shall be called communists. Thus is shall be easier to (1) quell rumours of civil war, to which the public of the world may be sympathetic (2) to call the before named in digenous people, infiltraters and, or aggressors, titles to which the public of the world have been educated to recog- nise as the "enemy" without thought or question. This unwritten article is necessary as the Treaty of SEATO only provides for:— "collective defense to resist armed attack from without (Article 2), but as per Article "USA's recognition of armed attack and aggression apply -only to communist ao-o-rpssinn."
