 STUDENTS PRO-LIBERAL BUT ANTI-DRAFT QENERAL opposition to conscription for Viet nam among students was shown in a poll conducted by Melbourne University Stud ents' Representative Council. Although the vote suggested that, as usual, most students, who come generally from the affluent classes, would vote Liberal. even those were against the Government's use of conscription for Vietnam. Eighty per cent wanted con scription in limited circum stances but only '74 of 2700 thought Vietnam was one of these circumstances. The biggest percentage— 43— would vote Liberal, but even of these only 25 per cent fav ored' conscription for Vietnam. About 52 per . cent believed that conscripts should have some choice other than full time military service. About 25 per cent of the Lib erals and about . 10 per cent of the whole voted against aid of any kind to south Vietnam. The General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in South Australia last week resolved that nobody should be sent to fight in Vietnam against his will.
