 Slice of King's Cross "DANDlCOOT on a Burnt Bridge", by Marian Dreyer, is the first of a series of Australian plays to to be presented by Studio 228, a smaii piaynouse on the corner of Peters Lane and Forbes Street, Dorlinghurst. This play deservedly won the Journalists Club Award of $2,000. Structurally it is excellent and shows great mastery of the dry sardonic humour of everyday Australian dialogue at its best, - A murderer holed up in an op posite flat provides a catalyst which causes a King's Cross couple to show themselves as the individuals they are and leads to the final tragedy. The play is so local that only those who know the Cross well could completely appreciate it. From the drab, stunted lives with which it deals, it is able to pro duce a living texture full of humour, pathos and good theatre. Allan Penney and Suzanne Roux were outsfandina as ffia hushnnrf and wife. â€” - K.R.
