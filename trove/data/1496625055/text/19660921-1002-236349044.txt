 Charlie stakes a claim By Gloria Sanderson JNOTHER century-maker joins the ranks! It's hearty congratulations to Charlie West from Cooks Hill. New- castle, who has put in a tre mendous effort to take him within challenging distance of "the King". I met one of Paddy's staunch supporters and told her about Newcastle's bid for supremacy. She gave a grin and referred to plans they've made which, she says, will guarantee it's Paddy King who takes off the nation al trophy! I wonder what plans Charles West has made for the rest of the competition? Also heard they had a tor i-rifle- evening out Waverley last Saturday in honour of Stan Knopman's 20 years of Tribune selling at Bondi Junction. The proceeds of the night will mean some thousands of extra votes for Stan when they are registered.
