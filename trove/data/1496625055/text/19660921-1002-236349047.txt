 Star gestured dancing \ disappointingly small audi ence was on hand for the annual recital by Margaret Barr's Sydney Dance-Drama Group, in conjunction with me National Institute of Dramatic Art, at the Univer- sity of N.S.W. Theatre at Kensington last Friday night. A pity, for Miss Barr once again offered a stimulating and imaginative programme of great variety and depth. The featured work, "A Small People", was a most effective and artistically realised affirma tion of support for the Viet namese people in their struggle against American intervention. Miss Barr and her dancers portrayed graphically and mov- mgly the assault on the Viet namese people's customs and national dignity, the ballet's fin al sequence ("We face you, you Big Peoples, and are on our guard") showing them entwin ed. in barbed wire but still of fering defiant resistance. . In this and other items, light- I wg, costumes and use of the j stage were nothing short of j nlliant. Unfortunately, how- | . Miss Barr's demanding nniques sometimes overtaxed i , ®r dancers, some of whom are m every item on the 2-hour Programme. J! Pick of the excellent sup-- porting items was "Star-Gestur- RrcoUdren"' to Prokofiev's cnrfn Aphony, a beautifully conceived and executed piece pure lyricism which seemed anriSmg of what Miss Barr— c man— considers life Gngnt to be like. r®cital wil1 he repeated Satn? y night at 8 p,m and ' h ay afternoon at 2 p.m.f und should not be missed. R.M. Guest artist Tahnia (above) goes Polynesian at the Trade Union Youth Week Talent Quest finals held last week at the Sydney Technical College. The finals attracted 26 entries, with first prize of 120 dollars going to young Newcastle vocalist Lynette Newell. Other items included a Didgeridoo player, magic, Go Go dancing and folk singing.
