 Just a short head between pHARLIE WEST has moved still closer to Maritime's Paddy King and at this stage looks very definitely a con- tender for the national title. Stan Knopman added just on 9,000 votes from the social honoring his 20' years of Tri bune selling at Bondi Junction and now moves into fourth place in Sydney. The neck-and-neck battle between West Sydney's repre sentatives shows Bill Britton in front again from Bill Sanderson, with the winner to be decided shortly and then made West Sydney's candidate to carry their fotal votes in the compe tition. Apparently there's some con fusion in votes coming from the South Coast— Bill Williams says we've given him too many! We're investigating the score and will try to have it straight ened out by next .issue— so this week's figure for bill may well not be correct either.
