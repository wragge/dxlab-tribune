 The lady burns in vain yHAT a play staged so attractively and presented with such spirit and imaginat ion as the WEA Drama Groun's production of Christopher Fury's "The Lady's Not for Burning" should have failed to draw decent audiences, is due not so much to public apathy as to the difficulties experienced by amateur theatres with re gard to publicity. Despite the remoteness of its setting — "the small market town of Cool Clary more or less" — the play appeals to the modern audience by its wit and colourful extravagance of language, treating love, the death wish and witch-hunting in such a spirit of mockery and banter as to be more amusing than deeply moving. Thomas Mendip, the dis charged soldier who, between demands to be hanged, pours forth from the garden win dow a flow of irreverent raillery against bigotry, ni,t- wittery and conformity, was played with dash by John Milson, while the engaging witch who can turn a telling phrase even while threatened with burning was kept alive by Judy Ann Morgan. The character roles were handled efficiently and at times hilariously by Gwen . Baxter as the mother, George Baker as the Mayor, Alan Blackman as the Chaplain, Dan O'Sullivan as the Justice,, and finally Kenneth Bryce as Skipps, the rag and bone merchant whose ' resurrection provides the de- noueirient. Anthony Wallis, Jeremy Cordeaux and Timothy Read brought freshness to the more juvenile roles, while Alizon Eliot, the unsophisticated young lass who manages in the brief course of the play's action to develop into a woman who knows what and whom she wants, was played by the very attractive and talented Jill Brislan. , The play was under the 1 comuatant direction of Dun- can Whiting . — H.
