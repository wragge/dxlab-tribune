 AEU MAN'S ARBITRATION BOOK CYDNEY: "Penal Colony to Penal Powers," a book published by the Amalgamated Engineering Union, has been recommended for study to students by Dr. R. A. Gollan, Senior Fellow in History at the National University. \ Dr. Gollan, who launched the book at a function last Wednesday in Svdnev. said the book had immediate value to all trade unionists. Written by the AEU's Research Officer, Mr. J. Hutson, the book deals extensively with the arbitration system and its operation. In the words of the author, "it is not designed to be merely a descriptive work, but one that will assist the struggle for better living standards." Dr. Gollan said the author describes the central function of arbitration as being to dampen down militant struggle. Mr. Hutson's ideas were "clothed in a great deal of facts," he said. He considered that it would become a hand hook for trade unionists and a study hook for scholars. "It is likely to cause a lot of controversy," Dr. Gollan said. Mr. Garland, the secretary of the union's Commonwealth Council, said the publication of the hook was part of a program to publish much needed works in the area,, of industrial history where there was so little. Other projects are two history volumes to cover the existence of the AEU in Australia since 1852, he said.
