 KEMIRA MEN A T LAST PROVED RIGHT OLLONGONG : The 50-day strike by minfers at the Kemira Colliery on . NSW South Coast was vindicated last week when the management withdrew men from working on the dusty side of a machine. The strike of 300 men result- ed when miners were suspend ed by the Australian Iron and Steel for refusing to work in high concentrations of coal and rock dust. A condition of the return to work was that the men working on a disputed machine would only do so under direct medical supervision. Modify Kemira miners had earlier told Tribune that bv a sHpht. modification the machine could be successfully operated with out causing a dust hazard. This in fact was proved with a similar machine at the South Bulli pit. The Commonwealth Arbitra tion 'Court, on an application from the company, ordered the men to return to work. The men did so on the under standing that Dr. Outhred, the Medical Consultant of the Joint Coal Board, supervise the whole of the Board's dust counting staff. During an earlier dispute the men cnanengea tne dust tests being taken in the mine. As yet no official report has been given by Dr. Outhred on dust. Miner's Federation Dis trict president, Mr. W. Smart commented last week: Necessary "We have not yet had access to the actual dust counts, but the management's instruction is clear-cut evidence that our campaign against dust was ab solutely necessary." Discussions were also held last week between the miners' officials and engineers from the Board on the proposals to modify the machine. It seems incredible that min ers and their wives and fami lies should have had to suffer a 50-day strike because of the arrogance of a wealthy steel monopoly. On top of this the Miners' Federation, had to pay the high court costs incurred during the dispute.
