 Unions to iiiim iiniiy i iimj iii-m— -—Tin vote on merger JYDNEY: Members of three building unions are to vote for or against becoming amalgamated. The ballot will be held early next year among members of the Building Workers' Indus trial Union, the Operative Paint ers' and Decorators' Union and the Operative Plasterers' Fed eration. This decision was made last week in Sydney by the federal secretaries and presidents of the three unions. The proposed new union would cover the major classi fications in the building indus try with the exception of plumb ers and builders' labourers. It would embrace about 80,000 workers and have a potential of over 100,000 members. One of the suggested names for the amalgamated union is the National Union of Building Operatives.
