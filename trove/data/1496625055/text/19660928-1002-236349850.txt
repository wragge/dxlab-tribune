 [?] With Tribune's Industrial Roundsman COURT of Marine Inquiry into the tragedy of the dredge "W. D. Atlas", which claimed 13 lives on Mav 20 when it sank off Jervis Bay, began this week in Melbourne. On June 22 Tribune asked 10 leading questions about the tragedy including; whether the owners (Westminster Dredging ' Co.) knew it to be a death trap? Another question was why the heavy 35 ton tumblersâ€” part of the heavy superstructure- were not dismantled before it left Whyalla even though it would have meant waiting a further two days for the crane? It is believed that on the voyage out to Australia the dredge was forced to call in at Lisbon to have the tumblers dismantled because it was list ing in heavy seas. It is good to see that the in quiry is open to the public who will be expecting some frank answers to these questions! ? 'pRADESMEN from the Pub lic Works' Department held a mass meeting this week in Sydney to discuss a move by the Government to bring them under a common award with other departments. This could mean that PWD tradesmen stand to lose be tween $6 and $8 a week in over award payments and other concessions gained through struggle over the years. A MEETING of unions last week in Sydney decided to call a 2-hour stoppage of NSW railway workers on October 11, in protest' against Askin's refusals to meet a deputation to discuss long outstanding de mands, including sick pay, rail passes and wages. . It is anticipated that during the stoppage a large demonstra tion will be held outside Parli ament House.
