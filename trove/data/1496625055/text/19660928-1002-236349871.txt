 Houses or humpies? ''ALGETT (NSW) : The Aborigines Welfare Board is proposing to build cottages for the Walgett Aborigines which are below the minimum health and safety requirements of mo3t of NSW. The Aborigines are refus- ing to uve in tne cottages. The Board Superintendent. Mr. H. J. Green said last Monday that the building pro gram was being undertaken partly because "the infant death rate at Walgett was from two to five times as high as in the rest of the state." Mr. Green was addressing a meeting of the Joint Parlia mentary Committee on Abori gine Welfare. The Committee had called on Mr. Green to discuss the Board's plan to build 40 "transi tional" cottages at Walgett, the plans for which have been con demned by both the local Aborigines and the local Coun cil. The buildings will be pre fabricated, with iron frames and walls of metal and sheet ing. They are estimated to have a life of 10 years. They will not comply with Ordinance 71 of the Local Gov ernment Act covering minimum health and safety requirements In most areas of NSW. No wash basins Aboriginal children will have to clean their teeth and wash their hands in the kitchen sink because there will be no wash basins. There will be no hot water in the sink or in the showers. The cottages would have ex ternal cold showers and un- sewered toilets. Apart from a fuel stove in the kitchen there will be no heating and there will be no insulation. Mr. Green said that the resi dents would be able to get a cross-breeze if they kept the door open. There will be only one window in the bedrooms. Mr. Green admitted to Com mittee Chairman G. Crawford (Country Party) that there were three months of frost in Walgett. Asked by Mr. Crawford whe ther he thought it possible to cViAwor In nnlH urofar IV/Ti Green replied: "Yes".
