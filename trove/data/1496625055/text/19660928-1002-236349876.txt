 The P. J. Adams comes sailing home From a Correspondent in Brisbane DRIGHT with flags, the 32,000-ton Ampol tanker P. J. Adams sailed into Brisbane's Moreton Bay a week or so ago. Soon after Friday, she bumped gently against the piles of Fisherman's Wharf, to tie up in an Australian port for the first time in four years. Her Australian landfall, manned by Australian crew, was a great day for the Seamen's Union and Austra lians generally: it marked a triumphant climax to the long campaign to have Aus tralian tankers manned by Australian crews on Austra lian conditions. The P.J. Adams was built in Australia, with an Aus tralian Government subsidy. But, so as to evade Australian conditions, Ampol sent the P.J. Adams roaming the seven seas, out of Australian waters, with a low-wage foreign crew. Australian unionists kept up the pressure. And at last- after tug men in Brisbane had refused to bring in the giant Ampol— chartered tan ker Oceanic Grandeur ' — Ampol caved in and agreed to have the P.J. Adams man ned by an Australian crew. The tugs which hauled and nudged the P.J. Adams to her berth on Friday were beflagged and bore banners with seamen's welcoming slogans. The P.J. Adams crew also hung out a victory banner. The Seamen's Union general secretary (Mr. E. V. Elliott) boarded the ship. The union's Queensland secretary (Mr. J. Fitzgerald) and the Queensland Trades & Labor Council secretary (Mr. A. Macdonald) were on the wharf as the tanker moved in. At a shipboard meeting after the P.J. Adams tied up, seamen applauded their union leaders E. V. Elliott and J. Fitzgerald as they summed up the P.J. Adams victory. Then, in appreciation of the help received in the campaign, the seamen invited Mr. Mac donald of the T & LC and Pete Thomas of the Qld. Guardian to speak. They were applauded, too.
