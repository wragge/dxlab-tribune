 SEC men return and ban overtime JuiELBOURNE: Three thousand striking State Electricity Commission workers voted at a mass meeting in Victoria's Latrobe Valley power ceptre on Monday to return to work on a strict eight-hour- day, 40-hour-week basis. The men, who had been on strike for 10 days, decided to have a further mass meeting on Friday' to consider results of a conference on Tuesday between the SEC and Mel bourne Trades Hall Council on their log of claims. They were joined in strike action by fellow unionists in a number of city power plants. Moderate power restrictions were imposed. The unofficial strike struggle touched off by the Latrobe Valley men developed spon taneously out of the impatience and frustration born of a 14- month-long wait for a settle ment of their claims. They are seeking a 35-hour- week, increased margins, power house and area allow ance and an extra week of annual leave, with pay accord ing to roster. Differences During the course of the last week, differences became clearly apparent between the approaches of the right-wing and the militant unions. Where as the right wing concentrated on the unofficial character of the strike, the militant unions laid their main stress on the causes of the unrest; griev ances which had arisen from the policies of the Bolte Gov ernment and the SEC. A special meeting of the Trades Hall Council on Fri day, called to discuss the SEC strike, did not lead to the sharp divisions in the Council predicted by many daily press reports. It seems clear that even some right-wing union leaders had come round to the con clusion that disciplinary action against militant unions was no solution to the problem.
