 ABATTOIRS STRIKE CYDNEY: The 3,000 Homebush Abattoir workers are still on strike demanding the reinstatement of two sacked Meat Union dele gates. Following a mass meeting's rejection last week of a Labor Council Disputes Committee return to work proposal, In dustrial Commissioner Cook began to investigate the dis pute. Earlier he refused to do so until the men returned to work. The 3-week-old strike, invol ving 15 unions, began after the delegates were sacked for in sisting on their right to .be present during the interrogat ion of a member. Commiffee Workers at country abattoirs have agreed only to kill their normal tallies. The Homebush men have now set up a strike committee and are picketing the abattoirs. Rumours, started from an unconfirmed source, have been circulated that the delegates were caught stealing meat. This has angered the strikers. In a statement to Tribune, Mr. L. Jubow said: "The two delegates concerned were not sacked for pilfering as I was. "I believe the Meat Board sacked them for their milit ancy and for refusing to allow the security police to search me as it is outside their juris diction. "The delegates only insisted that civilian police have the authority to search an em ployee. "If ever two men were victims of victimation, these delegates were," he said. As Tribune goes to press the Disputes Committee is -meet ing to further discuss the dis pute.
