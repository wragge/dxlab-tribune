Not so much a game — it's a way of life! S I By The Challenger pound the Poms at cricket, do them over at Rugby League, and our tennis players have had a mortgage on the American national title for years. But there's one game so one nunarea per cent Aus tralian that we don't ex port it, mainly because nobody else plays it- Australian Rules. Last Saturday at the Melbourne Cricket Ground 101;655 football fans screamed themselves hoarse as St. Kilda won a hair's-breadth finish against Collingwood in the Victorian League Grand Final. It was St. Kilda's first premiership win and only the third time that it had made the grand final, it I won by the smallest pos- 1 sible margin— by 10-14 (74) 1 to 10-13 (73). No other sport in Aus tralia and very few sport ing centres in the world can draw the fans so much and so often as does Aus sie Rules in Melbourne. For example, in the play off for the grand final, Collingwood defeated St. Kilda before 96,000 and | another 95,500 saw St. | Kilda beat Essendon. The / all-time record for a Grand I I Final is 115,902 in 1956. \ J .How come the keen fol- 1 % lowing for the game? No I one can put his finger on 1 the exact reason, but one thine's certain: in Mel- 1 bourne Aussie Rules is more than a sport— it's a way of life. What about the public?! I Mick George writes | f a post-mortem on the | I Sydney League. 8 TUOW that League fever is 1 subsiding and the Dra- | gon supporters have col- | lected their winning bete, | it's time to think of the g people who keep the sport going — the long suffering spectators. ' The smaller crowd at the Grand Final this year —60,000— was probably due to the fact that many keen | football fans were not pre- g pared to put up with tne g shocking conditions of the 1 Sydney Cricket Ground. | .The ground was built | for cricket and the Trust g obviously intend to keep 1 it that way and have no intention of back profits from footbau crowds into better facil ities. However, not only head quarters, but most of tne suburban ' grounds can cater for only a few thou sand spectators in reason able comfort. In contrast are the glani- orous Leagues' clubs, where a 15-stone front-row forward is in danger ox getting bogged in tne carpet. The profits from the tinkling poker machines are spent in buying "big name" players by givinS players bigger bonuses and in a few cases in asdst- ing junior football. : But not a penny is spent on improving the lot of the spectator.
