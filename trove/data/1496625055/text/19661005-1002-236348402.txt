 WIFE'S APPEAL TO CLEAR FRAMED "SPY" "QUR opportunity to free Morton Sobell and vindicate the Rosenbergs is now a reality ... "This is only the first step in a series of new, developments wuicu we expect wui imttuy blow the lid off the entire Rosenberg-Sobell case. "As my husband, Morton Sobell, begins his 17th year in prison, the efforts of our lawyers and the courage and integrity of two eminent scientists, Drs. Morrison and Linschitz, reveal the tragic fraud which has permeated this trial." So writes Mrs. Helen So bell in a circular seeking fur ther support in efforts to free her husband, jailed in 1954 in connection with the fam ous Rosenberg frame-up. The Rosenbergs were exe cuted the same year for hav ing allegedly given the "sec ret of the atom bomb" to the USSR. Sobell was supposed to have been an accessory. The reprint Mrs. Sobell re fers to in her circular is of an article in the New York Times telling how the sup posed "sketch" of an atom bomb, which, the Rosenbergs were said to have passed on to the USSR has at last been released by the Government. It is seen to be a crude sketch which could have been done by any schoolboy â€” of no use for making an atom bomb or anything else. Two university professors, top-ranking scientists who now hold university chairs, Professors Morrison and Lin schitz, are prepared to testify to this effect. Both were intimately asso ciated with the manufacture of the first . atom bomb and know what they are talking about. Using affidavits they have signed, the Sobell ommittee is demanding a new trial for Sobell. Administrative sources are resisting this, since vindica tion of Sobell would also in volve exposure of the criminal frame-up and outright judicial murder of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Mrs. Sobell asks that funds be sent to the committee at Room 4, 940 Broadway, New York, 10010.
