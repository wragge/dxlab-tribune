 Man to the North . I am not paid the wage of a whiteman — Yet the white judge purr like a snake as he say: No discrimination. Squatter all great men. Union man from the South same colour as me,, he brings message that is written in sand: Soon I get wage same as any other man. I work since young feller breaking in horses, and South man ask: Who get profit from this source? Not the horse, not me, I get smashed foot, cracked head, few bob, chunk of beef, ' white flour and plenty sour. I see the boss man in his big house, many car, plenty tucker — what price black man, what price sucker! . The man from the South he talk good talk. Tell how whitefeller wharfie in the city, buy him overcoat, fight him who cut our throat. When Union man go I ask boss for more money. The boss man laugh. He think it funny. Then the pride of my tribe take hold of me — And the boss man roar as he chain me to a tree. The chain that bind me, I remember South man say: Together black and white, we tear it away.
