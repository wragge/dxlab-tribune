 Loaded dice of war One of the most damning indictments of the inhumanity of war to reach the screen for many years is Joseph Losey's "For King and Country", now showing at Sydney's Gala Cinema. Set in the mud and slime of the French front during the First World War, it deals with the trial of Private Hamp, brilliantly played by Tom Courtenay, for desertion. Unquestioningly loyal to the patriotic values on which he has been fed, the inarticulate Hamp has simply "walked away from the guns". Believing himself to have been "a good soldier", he is unable to grasp the fact that his life is at stake in the court-martial. The officer detailed to defend him, Captain Hargreaves, himself not game to stand up to the military machine, cannot win in the mock trial. Hamp's battalion is to be sent into action again, and Headquarters orders that he be summarily executed as a warning in advance to tha other troops. Even Hamp's death is not without torture. The firing squad's volley leaves him still breath ing, and in a last act of brutal compassion, Hargreaves put his pistol in the young soldier's mouth and delivers the coup de grace. More than the horror of war is exposed in this powerful film. The dice are over whelmingly loaded against Hamp and his work ing-class mates, shovelled to inevitable slaughter by forces they have no chance of comprehending or combating. r,m.
