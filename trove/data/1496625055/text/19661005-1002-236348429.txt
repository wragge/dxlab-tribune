 Stockmen's strike QONGRATULATIONS on the magazine section of "Tribune" lately, but may I comment on two misstate ments of fact appearing there in recent issues? The present industrial action by some 300 Aborigines i,n the Northern Territory is not as claimed (New Struggle for the North, Trib., 7/9/66) "the biggest strike in the history of the Aborigine people's struggle for equality". Donald Stuart, in his doc umented novel, YANDY, has recorded a strike involving greater numbers of Aborig inal pastoral workers in Western Australia, so far back as 1946. The passing of time should not filch from them their place in working class history. "The great Billy Lane who led the shearers' strike in 1891." (Stop Knockin' Ned. Trib. 14/9/66). Twelve men V; 1 were indicted and imprisoned || for "leading" the strike. Billy It Lane was not one of them. E "Part of the Glory", to be published later this year by The Australasian Book Soc iety will help- clarify misun derstanding of the part he played. With best wishes for your further informed reporting of the Northern Territory strike (and for the continuance of the all-male image of our folk hero, Ned). Lyndall Hadow, Scarborough (W.A.).
