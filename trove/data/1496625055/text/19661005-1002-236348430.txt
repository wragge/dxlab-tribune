 Adam and Eve T\ON'T for one moment think in my following criticism that I am against jokes, car toons or beer, let us have more of them, but in all cases better quality. The latter is- Union business, the former two are your readers' business. I am referring to the car toon of Sept. 14th. The fcian remarking to the barman that his Missus driyes him to drink. At first glance I was up in arms in defence of my own sex but on further study I realised the man was lowering the status pf his own .sex . . . reminiscent, of the story of Adam and Eve, where Adam blamed Eve for picking the apple and forcing Adam to partake of it . . . Surely after 2000 years man could be brave enough to stand on his own feet and admit that he is having his beer because he wants to, perhaps because he is still r. self avowed coward, there are still wars but I am wan dering from the point and that is to keep our cartoons on the high level of the paper itself, we will laugh more heartily and healthily..
