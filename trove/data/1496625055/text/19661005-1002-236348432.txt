 Horrifying pamphlet' TV/TAY I recommend other V . people to read, as I have, "American Atrocities in Vietnam"? To say I was horrified would be putting miidly. . What is happening to me human race to allow such war to continue? The 1939-45 war was bad enough. I lived in Lnuon through' all the bombing ana so I am no stranger to deaui E.nd destruction. f In the war in Vietnam, |l USA and Australia are tne | aggressors and I appeal witn | all my heart to all mothers | (I, too, have sons of call-up \ age) to object to this unde clared war; to show tne politicians that life. . precious and death is fina1, I We did not bear sons to take part in a war of torture against helpless civilians, whose only fault (if it is a fault) is that the Vietnamese are caught up in a conflict which they are powerless w j prevent.
