 You gotta get with it! BMaMaaaaaMaaiiMmwiiiiiiiiiiwww TV/TR. R. Dixon writes (Trib- 1VA une, Sept. 21) "How can immature children and teenagers become the vehicle of a great . cultural trans- formation?" Who else can, or ever did, make cultural revolutions? Surely not the old and middle- aged who stand, and always have stood, against revolut ionary change of any kind. Are not the Beatles more popular than Jesus Christ or for that matter than Marx and Chairman Mao too? Who is more representative of Australian revolutionary feel ing overseas — Harold Holt or Normi.e Rowe? If one wants to hear the revolutionary voice of the Soviet Union these days shall the choice be Brezhnev or Yevtushenko? When Australian youngsters demonstrate in Martin Place against Conscription and the war in Vietnam are they trying to make a cultural revolution against the wishes of their elders or do we brush them off as "immature"? Shall the efforts of students to end discrimination against Aborigines or to extend educational opportunities be under-estimated just because youngsters make the efforts? Surely, Comrade Dixon, it is not the age of the par ticipants in the Chinese cul tural revolution which de termines its validity but the ideas and the actions which make the' revolution. We certainly do not evaluate the qualities of the revolutionary ideas of Marx or Lenin by the age of the creators of the ideas — at least, I hope we don't. The excesses of the Chinese Red Guard are as foolish as the excesses of- men and women twice and thrice their age because excesses are in themselves foolish whoever carries them out. By all means let us discuss, argue and, if necessary, condemn the so-called cultural revol ution in China but let it . always be for its own special character and qualities not because some youngsters have sometimes acted like larri kins during its enactment.
