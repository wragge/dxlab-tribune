 DREDGE INQUIRY: ' NEGLECT ' CHARGE ELBOURNE: Evidence of very bad steering, in stability, leaks and general neglect was heard last week by the court of inquiry investigating the W. D. Atlas dredge disaster. The dredge sank off Jervis Bay on the night of May 20 during a voyage "from Whyalla to Sydney, with the loss of the lives of 13 of the 17 men on board. Officers who had served on the dredge during its voyage from England to Whyalla told the court that the steering was so bad that it was some times necessary to make a complete circle to bring the vessel back on course. When the ship called as Lisbon (Portugal) for repairs, a heavy tumbler assembly was removed from its high position and stowed in a safer place. But the same assembly was left in the high unstable pos ition during the fatal voyage. Preparatory work had been done to dismantle it, but the ship was ordered to sea before conipletion of this work. A shipwright, Mr. K. Juett, then said that he had been told by company executives "not to worry" about making badly fitting doors and hatches watertight for the last voyage.
