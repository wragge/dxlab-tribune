The unions are seeking the removal of many anomalies in the railway and road transport sick pay regulations which include: That the present five days per year full pay sick leave be extended to 15 days and to be -cumulative. That payment be made for sick leave irrespective of whether . overtime is worked during the period such leave is taken. That the present system of sick leave investigators be discontinued. Â© That the present notification of sickness by 10 a.m. as now required not be a condition of payment. The conference also called for a campaign to win the full claim for three service increments of $1.65 per week. Labor Council also decided to call a conference of unions to discuss the campaign for increased service increments. The Amalgamated Engineering Union sponsored this move following demands from workshops that action be taken against low wages in the industry.
