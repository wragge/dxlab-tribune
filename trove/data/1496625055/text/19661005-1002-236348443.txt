 JAP CP REVERSES STAND rpHE Japanese Communist Party has now published a detailed statement asserting the need for Soviet aid to Viet- nam and, in effect, rejecting the Chinese Communist Party claim that the Vietnamese must rely on their own strength. Vietnam, it says, has no alternative but to rely on aid, chiefly from socialist countries, in getting modern weapons, in cluding anti-aircraft guns and missiles. The more such aid it gets the less will be the sacrifice demanded of the Vietnamese.
