 ASKIN COVERS UP FOR HOLT: UNIONS PLAN CAMPAIGN — Savage plunder YDNEY: The NSW Labor Council is to organise a State-wide campaign, in cluding protest rallies, demanding restora tion of full value to wages. The Council decided this last 1 hursday immediate- , ly after condemning the NSW Liberal Government's Budget as "a savage and unjustified plunder of the people's pockets." The resolution stated that the people of NSW were being subjected to higher hospital charges and heavy fares increases and would be compelled to bear the costs of cheque and stamp duty increases because the Askin Government was acting in collusion with the Federal Government to enable Holt to impose a dishonest pre-election budget on the people. "Premier Askin has refused to meet the trade union movement of this State, an action which merits the condemnation of all citizens,"\ it said. The Council demanded that the State Government implement trade union proposals which would remove the need for fares increases and other increased charges. The proposals include: © The return to NSW of all monies collected from petrol tax. The ending of freight concessions to the breweries, BHP and other wealthy companies. © The imposition of a State capital gains tax. © A more substantial allocation of tax monies from the Commonwealth. © The introduction of price control in NSW and the initiation of moves for Federal price control. ' Labor Council secretary, Mr. J. Kenny, told delegates that the campaign must go throughout the whole state and be the greatest ever waged. He called for the holding of lunch hour meetings and protest rallies.
