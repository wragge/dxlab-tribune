 Film shows mechanised loading By our Industrial Roundsman QNE hundred and fifty tons of cargo unloaded in 10 minutes, with one man, one pair of hands located in the crane cabm high above the ship, now doing the work; previously requiring eight hours toil by 20 men. And as the film commentator continued to unload more facts, Sydney waterside workers watched the drama being played out in technicolor. This film, shown last week at the Sydney rooms of the Wat erside Workers' Federation, was produced by the Matson Navigation Company of Ame rica. With dramatic impact, it showed how the trade between the US and Hawaii has, been modernised through the con- tainerisation of cargo. Replaced It showed the special ships carrying their 24ft x 8ft x 8ft steel containers stacked six m me uuias ana iour nign on deck, a machine which picks up the containers and stacks them in the yard or loads onto trailers, and the containers themselves — refrigerated or standard— or for livestock, or even rum. What the film didn't show was what happened, to the Hawaiian wharf ies replaced by this modernisation. However, even this film is out of date. . The giant US Kaiser Co. is offering a scheme whereby the loading or unloading and stor age of cargo can be done by one man using a pushbutton and a. computor. The system is completely automated and a single oper ator, with a computor, controls and records all movements of cargo containers.
