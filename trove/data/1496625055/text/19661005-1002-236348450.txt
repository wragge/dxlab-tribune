 A blow to jolt Holt By Gloria Sanderson jAST week's Tribune sales 8 meeting in Sydney dis- i cussed plans for the remain- | ins- weeks of the Pomilar E seller competition. I Using the Federal elections J as a basis, Tribune canvasses and election functions are being i planned in as many Sydney i suburbs as possible. All elec- tion meetings in streets, halls or cottages will have Tribunes available. Election door-knockers will be asked to carry Tribune for sale to interested people. Points gained from the sales drives and cottage functions will be credited to Popular Seller candidates from the ap propriate areas. The Sydney Popular Seller campaign will reach its climax on Saturday, November 19, with a big cabaret for the an nouncement of winning sellers and the awarding of prizes. Guests of the cabaret will be the winning sellers from New castle and Wollongong. I'd like to hear plans for the remainder of the competition from other Districts and States.
