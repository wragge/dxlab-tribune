 TRIBUTE TO A 'TOUGH A USTRALIAN' GLOWING tribute was paid to the late Bill Mountjoy at his large funeral in Sydney last Tuesday week by the Federal secretary of the BWIU, Mr. Frank Purse. Mr. Mountjoy, he said, had been a foundation member of the Communist Party in West Australia, had given dis tinguished service as a member of the Bricklayers' Union and in the 1940's had been the Can berra representative of Tri bune. Mr. Purse said that perhaps his outstanding characteristic was his Australianism. uim uiume j. neara saia oi | him was that he was as Aus- 1 tralian as our gum trees and j as tough. 1 "Bill's interests were wide j and varied and he was noted j for his great knowledge of aus- i tralia. I "He could discourse at length j on such matters as agriculture, j the cattle industry, soils, pas- | tures, mineral and water re- ! sources, forestry and so on," j Mr. Purse said. 1 "He was a member of an ! important research foundation. J "The results of Bill's work j in these fields led to his ac- j ceptance as an authoritative j person by his associates and ! his opinions were sought by | them. I "Some of his material had ! been published in Tribune and the Australian Left Review. "There was no subject of na tional importance that did not attract his attention. He was greatly interested in such pro jects as the Snowy River scheme, the Ord River develop ment, the great iron ore and other mineral projects and the development of the northern part of Australia."
