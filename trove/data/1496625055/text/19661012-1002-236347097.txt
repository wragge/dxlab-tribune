This warning was made by Fire Brigades' Union Acting Secretary, Mr. Frank Bryson at. last week's NSW Labor Council meeting. He was speaking about the "dangerous and deadly chemic al, carbon-tetrachloride (CTC) which is still being used in some extinguishers." Warning Some years ago the union successfully campaigned to have these CTC extinguishers re placed in the NSW Fire Brig ade. The union' is now warning the public that these dangerous extinguishers are still widely used in industry. The union also believes that few people realise the extreme hazard of this chemical, the fumes of which are dangerous and in decomposition generates a deadly gas. The Family Safety Magazine in America found that this chemical was readily available for household use and widely used as a cleaning fluid. American doctors say they cannot estimate how many cases of TCT poisoning occur a year as the symptoms are easily confused with those of other ailments, mainly hepatitis and nephritis. Besides accepting the warn ing, Labor Council delegates also decided to have the matter raised with the Department of Health.
