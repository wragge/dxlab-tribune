 CALWELL BACK IN TRIUMPH AT MOSMAN JYDNEY: Speaking in a crowded Mosman Town Hall, Labor leader Calwell said Labor's opposition to the Vietnam war would be explained to President Johnson when he visited Australia later this month. "We believe that friendship between Australia and the USA would be best served by having an independent Aus tralian foreign policy", Mr. Calwell said. Mr. Calwell called for a cessation of all bombing attacks by the Americans on Vietnam. The Americans, hie said, had dropped more bombs on North Vietnam in the past six months than on Germany dur ing the last war, but it was having no effect on Vietnamese resistance. The war would only be stopped by agreement, said Mr. Calwell. He called attention to the threat of nuclear war and ex- President Eisenhower's state ment that he would not pre clude the use of nuclear wea pons in Vietnam. President Johnson was now doing in Vietnam what Sen ator Goldwater had proposed in 1964â€” and what Johnson himself had opposed. Mr. Calwell repeated that a Labor Government would with- draw conscripts from Vietnam after consultations. Ho praised the "orderly student parades" of protest against .the Vietnam war which had been held in the various State capitals in Australia the previous Wednesday. Mr. Calwell /was returning to the scene of the murder attempt on him on June 21. Referring to the fMichaelis case Mr. John Grahame, the ALP candidate for North Syd ney, said the Government would go to any lengths to stifle opposition to its Vietnam policy, even using security police files to slander a defen celess woman. "Here is something else for Security to note down: I my self utterly and totally oppose the Government's policy on Vietnam. I have been to' a meeting of the ICD," Mr. Grahame said, amid cheers. Mi'. J. R. McClelland, ALP candidate for Warringah, said it was clear Holt regarded "LBJ" with the same affection that Sir R. Menzies had for the Queen.
