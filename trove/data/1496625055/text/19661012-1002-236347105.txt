 Burchett surfaces for Berlin meet Burchett, famous Australian war correspondent, has come almost directly from the South Vietnam jungles to join over 300 international journalists from some 80 countries at the World Congress of Journalists in Berlin. Burchett, who flew from Pnompenh to Prague and then Berlin, has been asked to address a mass rally in Paris after the Congress to demand cessation of the war in I Vietnam. The International Organisation of Journalists, sponsor of the Congress, has also issued a special invitation to Tribune's overseas representative, Rupert Lockwood, to attend as an observer. Burchett's report to the World Congress of Journalists will be of special significance, because the issue of journal ists' responsibility in spreading the truth about the Vietnam war is high on the agenda. The Congress discussions are under three headings: Political, Professional and Social. The Congress will discuss how professional, educational and economic help can be extended to journalists of Africa, Asia and Latin America. African and Asian journalists are already receiving professional training in an old castle near Prague. ni muni in mi 1 1 BnnniniT— mn—nmmmnMHimBigTW nua
