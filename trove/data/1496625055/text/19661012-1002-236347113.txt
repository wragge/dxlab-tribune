 SONNET FOR A SUNDAY ("17 Australian dead — but they kill 130 Viet Cong" — Sunday newspaper headline.) Whose body stiffens in the jungle grass, Its face upstaring out of stricken eyes? Whose blood is it that slowly spreads and dries While grinding helicopter engines pass? Did he once belt an ancient battered car Down bitumen beside a golden beach? Or strum a love song from a strong guitar, And ponder planets just beyond his reach? Or did he barefoot guide a wooden plough That slashed the stubble and upturned root? And one bright night beneath the banyan bough Entice a song from out his bamboo flute? I cannot see the face of that dead one, But this I know ... he is my son, my son. Mona Brand
