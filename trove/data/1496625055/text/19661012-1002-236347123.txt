 Theatre ntHE kindest thing that can be - said about "Dylan" — Sidney Michaels' play about the last months of Welsh poet Dylan Tho- mas, now snowing at tne inde pendent — is that it's in slightly bad taste. Based on John Malcolm Brin- nin's sophisticated piece of Peep- ing-Tomism, "Dylan Thomas in America", and Caitlin Thomas' caterwauling "Leftover Life to Kill", it dredges up once again the inti mate side of Thomas' extravagant life, doing less than justice to him as a poet of real sensitivity and depth. We are treated to a full pre sentation of Thomas' whoring and drinking during his two famous lecture tours of America, replete with ;iis suicidal downing of "eight een whiskies straight". The more than frank dialogue obviously titillated the Independ ent's suburban North Shore aud ience, as did the selfconsciously reverent dropping of quotations from his better-known poems, as if they were snatches of Hamlet's soliloquies. But soaring above the philistin- inism of the play is the magni ficent solo performance of Peter O'Shaughnessy as Dylan, who leaves this reviewer with the exciting sus picion that in him we may have a great actor by any standards. Claire Dunne acts as badly — if it were possible — as she did in "They're a Weird Mob", as the all-American. girl who tries to put Dylan straight, and Guy Le Claire cannot do much with the stilted part of Thomas' would-be Boswell, Brinnin. rpKZ "Q" Lunchtime Theatre's J- current offering of "Bachelor Girls", by Lanford Wilson, is a mildly amusing diversion about the romantic disappointments of two New York office girls. Amber Mae Cecil and Janice Copland handle the two parts ef ficiently enough, but producer Ted Hepple rather over-points the tire some theme of human loneliness by planted pauses and (I think) a swirl of melancholy Brahms at the final curtain.
