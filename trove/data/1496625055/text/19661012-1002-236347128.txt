 ON THE BALL, BUT THREE YEARS TO O LATE wnBrTuMlmml»iMiMiiMMi i mm mi i Letters to the : flBBMSHBBBBBBSHBBSSSBBKBHBHUBBuBI ' Editor JAURIE Aarons' state ment ' on China (31/8/66) was tops but (there's always a dialec- tical but!) his criticism of her leaders comes about three years too late. We continued to apply the good principle of non-inter ference in other Parties even when the basis for it had long vanished. The net result was , uncertainty in our ranks and among our friends. To preserve unity (as we hoped) we remained silent When Mao and Co. started on, and soon escalated, their ideological and political ram page. They were guilty of great power chauvinism and even racism (the "east wind", etc.) but we said nothing. They intruded into our inner- Party affairs; we stayed silent. The Mao-influenced Indo-leadership advised the starving peasants to eat rats. Still silent. For two years or more Mao has been hinder ing effective aid to the Vietnam liberation forces. Again silence. There is a great passage in Dante's "Divine Comedy" —where all the characters are suffering grievous wounds over their hearts. Every one knows that the others are similarly afflicted. But no body mentions i,t. When may we "interfere"? When a Party leadership has reneged from Communism and causing us great concern. Strikingly relevant here is Lenin's angry final warning to Lunar charsky (who with Gorky and others were busy with the mystical "God-build ing," etc.): "I am debating this with you only because there are still grounds for a fight on Comradely lines." . Ours is a great responsibility in the struggle for peace and to defend Australia's national independence from those try ing to make our country a bastion (or bridgehead, vehicle spearpoint) for imperialist re- conquest of China and Asia. The first need is not "proto col" and the like, but unequi vocal opposition to the abor tion of "Chinese Marxism." Harry Gould, Sydney.
