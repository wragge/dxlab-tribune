 Budget raw deal TJARRY Gould (Mona Vale . N.S.W.) raises the ques tion that while social service pensioners received an . in- crease in pensions from the budget dependent children got nothing. This position is also true of all those receiving social services payments who be long to minority groups. The wife allowance (for the wife of a pensioner) remains at an inadequate $6 per week. This should be increased to a full pension with the only qual- ification that the wife be de pendent upon her husband. At present very few wives qualify, and recently I took this matter up with the Federal Minister for Social Services and he indicated in a lenghty reply that no alter ation could be seen in the foreseeable future. Next on the list who re ceived a raw deal from the budget were the people un lucky enough to be on socia service payments either form sickness or unemployment. This miserable pittance pa to these people has not ceived any increase ior a number of years. I know of two cases re cently where workers were obliged to go onto sockJ service payments due to sick ness. t.a«a In both cases they were forced at' first to eat up au of their small savings, then to proceed to go into deb . There are a lot of an(® alies in relation to soma service payments that n attention. Unfortunately people on the receiving of these injustices are m small minority and scattere > and hence have no or=f/;ir ation of their own to do the fighting. The only way of overeom ing the problem of organ ation is for the Trade to do th6 job, in facu it their duty to do something more for their sick and une ployed members. Jim SharrocK, Redfern (NSW)-
