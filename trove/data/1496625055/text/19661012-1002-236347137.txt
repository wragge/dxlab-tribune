 In defence of Vic Williams pURTHER to Roger Milliss's comment on Victor Williams' Ham mers and Seagulls (Trib- une, 24/8/66). A poet's work presented retrospectively, does not necessarily (nor should it be expected to) display only present stature. Divorced from its immed iacy of ten years ago, The Price of Blood may not, as the reviewer suggests, rank as the best of Victor Williams' work, but merits inclusion, acclaimed and recited in appropriate situations re moved from the traditional throughout Australia, as it was. Perhaps an arrangement in chronological order might have helped the reviewer to a balanced opinion of the retrospective, though collation according to well defined phases in the life of the poet has supplied a better opportunity of assessing his development. Apparently, too, in failing to recognise that in Victor Williams' work content has called the measure, Roger Milliss has allowed less than his due to an innovator. Leaving behind ballads springing from his country life and war, the poet, with his entry into heavy industry set himself the task of writ ing what he sees as the sensuous, emotional poetry of the life and work of men his days are now spent with, and came after much experi ment to understand the need of new form for new con tent. With few models before him, few paths to follow, he has succeeded, perhaps in Delegate and Hammers and Seagulls itself; these con sciously directed to give ,(I quote his own words) "the disciplined, persistent, bare and dramatic Jeffects" that content, (collective labour of heavy industry) demands, will doubtless live long after the traditionalist skills and techniques approved by Roger Milliss have had their day. Victor Williams, sure bush- man that he is, found the way and is still mapping (it. Where is the young poet new emerging who will follow the lead that Delegate, Ham mers and Seagulls and others in his 'collection have given towards a Socialist poetry in Australia?
