 M.P. attacks Govt 'expediency' on Ord From a Special Correspondent pERTH: The complete financial success of Ord River farmers proved that Federal delay on the second stage of the project . was mere political expediency, said Dr. Rex Patterson, former head of the Northern division of . the Department of National Development. Dr. Patterson was delivering the John Curtin memorial lecture at W.A. University last week. The Holt Government's ap proach to' the Ord was one of the most scandalous acts which could ever he perpet rated by any government, said Dr. Patterson, who is now Federal Labor member for Dawson. The Ord project would eventually be one of Australia's greatest assets. It was a tragedy for ' the future welfare of Australia to see valuable long-term invest- ment projects such as minerals and high rainfall cattle land falling almost exclusively under overseas control. Reluctance Because of the reluctance of the Federal government to give a greater share of devel opment funds to W.A. and Queensland, these states had little alternative but to rely heavily on overseas funds, he said. It was degrading to Australia as a whole that the North was becoming more ' and more a colony of overseas countries. All those who have cam- paigned for the Ord will wel come Dr. Patterson's forthright stand. The struggle for Aus tralian independence will bene fit from his exposure of the menace of overseas control. However, his advocacy of federal funds of "bona fide" Australian oompanies (whi.ch would presumably include BHF, CSR etc) for mineral and basic development is not much of an alternative. Surely government enter prise would present the best bona fides for the safeguarding of Australian independence and national benefit from our mineral resources.
