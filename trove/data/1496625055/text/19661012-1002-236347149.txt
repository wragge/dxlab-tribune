 MP's congrats to Michaelis CANBERRA: "I congratulate the lad on his courage," Mr. F. M. Daly, Labor, NSW, said in parliament in the discussion on the Robert Michaelis case. "Let us hope that there are thousands more like him and they will awaken an apathetic Australian pudiic. "I wonder what the parents think when boys such as 'this go to camp, and instead of being taught to fight they participate in a hate campaign against people they have never seen, the people of countries with which we shall have te live as time ?oes by". Government MHRs, said Mr. Daly, were touchy about the conscription of schoolboys. "They have guilty consciences. Their hands drip with the blood of conscript boys, the boys they sent to their doom in a war in which they should not have been fighting."
