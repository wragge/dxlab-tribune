 Renshaw wants an answer On hospital benefits increase JYDNEY: Leader of the Opposition in the NSW Parliament (Mr. J. B. Renshaw) has written to the Federal Minister for Health (Dr. A. J. Forbes) seeking an immediate decision by the Federal Government on increased hospital benefits. Mr. Renshaw said that he had done this because the State Minister for Health (Mr. Jago) had said that he did not consider the matter was urgent, despite the fact that hospital fees had dras tically increased in NSW as from October 1. In his letter to Dr. Forbes, Mr. Renshaw said that delay by the Commonwealth in the matter of increasing hospital benefits was undoubtedly caus ing grave concern to a large number of patients in NSW hospitals. He added that the latest fig ures showed that more than half a million people had been treated as in-patients at public hospitals in NSW over a 12 month period. In his letter Mr. Renshaw said that it was only natural when joining a recognised benefit scheme a person would take into account the Common wealth scheme benefits pay- able and would reasonably anticipate that these benefits would meet expenses incurred in hospital. Unless some retrospective ar rangement was made to cover patients who had entered hos pital since October 1, these people would not be adequately covered and would be suffer ing a financial loss. Mr. Renshaw urged Dr. Forbes to give his request im mediate attention so that the contribution scales and bene fits could be adjusted. He also urged that provision be made .whereby benefits under the new arrangement would be retrospective to Oc tober 1 in NSW. Mr. Renshaw.
