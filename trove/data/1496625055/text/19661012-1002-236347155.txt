 Sitting on a sure thing? ¥ OOKS like the 1966 festivi ties will start early in Sydney! On Saturday, Novem ber 12, Maritime — figuring they're on a sure thing— will hold a Paddy King Victory Cabaret, one of the big events of the social season. Known far and wide for the top-level entertainment, cater- nig and music they provide (ask their 300 satisfied custom ers from a couple of months back) the Maritime committee are confident they'll fill the hall and substantially swell Paddy's votes. Anyone looking for a first- class night out is advised, to ring 29-2321 SOON and hook for November 12. You can follow up on the gaiety by booking for the grand finale— the Popular Seller Prize Cabaret the following week- Saturday, November 19 ('phone 26-2161).
