 Nurses ' purses eaual to men's JYDNEY: The granting of equal pay to wonien psychiatric nurses in NSW last week is a success ful ending to a long campaign. And the young men and women who paraded with ban ners and demonstrated outside Parliament have good reason to be pleased with themselves. They have in fact established another small beach-head in the age-old struggle for wom en's equality. The equal pay decision was, included in a new award grant ed by the State Industrial Commission and will affect over 3000 nurses, more than half of whom are women, at the State's 14 psychiatric hos pitals. The new award gives a first year nurse $2452 a year, an in crease of $623 for a female and $145 for a male. a men year iquy trained nurse will receive $3010— a $700 increase for a female and $227 for a. male. Matrons will now receive $4302— the same as a chief male nurse. A joint application for the new award was made by the Health and Research Employ ees' Association and the NSW Nurses' Association. The case began early this year following a. rejection of the equal pay claim by the Public Service Board. In giving his judgment last week, Mr. Justice Sheehy said that females are doing the same range and volume of work under the same conditions as males. This was well known to the nurses, and the reason why they demonstrated and issued leaflets to the public exposing this inequality. As two second year nurses from Callan Park (a young man and a lass) said when they demonstrated at Town Hall station last April: "We often work together in the same ward with equal work and responsibilities." The only difference was that the man received about $10 a week more than his workmate.
