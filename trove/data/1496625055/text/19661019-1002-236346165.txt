 SLAUGHTERMEN WIN STRIKE VICTORY CYDNEY : The ordered reinstatement last week by the State Industrial Commission of two sacked union delegates at the Homebush Abattoir is re garded by workers as a victory for their stand to nreserve union ri&rhts. The sacking of two Meat Union delegates on September 6, sparked off a 3-week strike by 3000 men from 15 unions. The two men were dis missed by the Meat Board for insisting on their right to be present during the interrogation of a member. v This action by the Board added fuel to the workers already strong hostility against the Board's long history of anti-union activity. Mr. Jubow, in a statement to Tribune during the strike, said: "The delegates concerned were not sacked for pilfering as I was. "I believe the Meat Board sacked them for their militancy and for refusing to allow the security police to search me as it is outside their jurisdic tion." Mr. Justice Cook, in order ing the reinstatement, said the two delegates, Messrs Kelly and ' Pranks, believed they were protecting the inter ests of a union member. He said his findings did not involve any condemnation of the Board . nor any reflection on the patrolmen. The strikers returned to work on the agreement that if the Commission ordered a reinstatement, the Board is to pay the two delegates their normal pay from the date the strike ended. The Board will now meet the unions to discuss the rights and duties of delegates and restrictions on patrolmen.
