 LABOUR LEFT'S NEW LIFE' I ONDON: TASS newsagent- cy's London correspondent notes what he calls a new development in the life of the British Labor Party. He says that though tne Government and Prime Min ister Wilson managed, to win approval of their policy as r. whole at the Party confer ence at Brighton, they failed to block resolutions condem ning their position on some important questions. Opposition to the - Right: wing leadership's policy was strong, one reason being that the Left wing again has an . active leader in Frank Cousins, general secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union, Britain's largest. The TASS correspondent, Igor Orestov, notes three resolutions the passages of which marked a ' defeat for the Government â€” a resolution moved by Cousins deploring the sharp growth of unem ployment, another demanding the withdrawal by 1970 of British forces east of Suez and r. third demanding greater pressure on the US to make it call off the Vietnam war. Adoption of these resolut ions encouraged the Left and gave it greater confidence in its strength. In the struggle that is only just beginning the Left forces in Britain will certainly fight even harder for a change in British policy in the direction of peace, says Orestov.
