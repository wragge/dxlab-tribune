 — — — — — — ii NO ONE SAID WE'D BE FIGHTING FOR YANKS Letters to the Editor J-HERE has been much controversy over the calling-up of twenty-year- old migrants into the armd forces. Some editors of local foreign language newspapers have been subjected to much abuse through letters and phone calls, some of them downright insulting. One of these editors was in the Australian armed forces dur ing World War 2. Speaking for the Greek section in our community I would like to say that during World War II, out of 40,000 Greeks residing in Australia (naturalised and not) over 8,000" went into the A.I.F. and militia, because they felt with their fellow Australians that Australia was in great danger. Several Australians have said to me that they "went over to Greece during the War to help the Greeks". Some 14,000 Australians did so, an effort much apprec iated by the Greeks. But we must not forget that thousands of Greeks were ex ecuted by the Germans, and others risked their lives every day for years, in sheltering Australians, feeding them and in many cases helping them to escape to the Middle East. Coming to the present sit uation and the War in Viet nam there are several points to be considered:— Firstly, Australia is not. in danger from invasion from any of our neighbours. Secondly, we are not at war with Vietnam. Thirdly, mig rants were not told when they considered migrating here that they would be conscrip ted into the army and sent overseas to fight to protect American Imperialism. Most young migrants I have spoken to say they would not hesitate to join up, if Australia were really in danger, as their countrymen did in the last War. Along with hundreds of thousands of Australians and millions of Americans, many migrants do not approve of the war in Vietnam. James Galanis (ex-A.I.F.), Waterloo (N.S.W.).
