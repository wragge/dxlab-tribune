 Gl sheeties stop work C YDNEY: The low wage standards of tradesmen at Garden Island Naval Dockyard in Sydney are revealed in the fact that semi-skilled ironworker riggers receive 15 cents1 more pay than a tradesman. This sparked off a 4-hour protest stoppage by 35 sheet metal workers and their 15 as sistants last Monday. Mr. R. Hawkes (Sheet Metal Workers' Union delegate) said: "We are not against the riggers receiving higher wage rates. We are protesting against the long delays in granting wage in creases to tradesmen and their assistants." Following a decision by the GI management last Friday, ship's riggers now receive 15 cents a week more than sheet metal workers, boilermakers, fitters and other tradesmen who are required to serve five years apprenticeship. The strikers have sent a tele gram t6 the Australian Coun cil of Trade Unions protesting against the long delays by the navy in granting the unions' wage claims. The ACTU had again put for ward these claims at a meeting with navy representatives ear lier this month. These claims include: A $5.90 increase in trades men's margins. A 50 cents to $4 increase in the establishment allowance. A 50 cents to $2 clothing allowance.
