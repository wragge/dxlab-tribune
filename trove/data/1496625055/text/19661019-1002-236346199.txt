The Minister of Labor and Industry (Mr. Kneebone) stat ed that — "This Bill, introduced by a member of the LCL, represents a somersault from the position his Party had adopted previously". The Leader of the Opposition in the Council (Sir Lyell Mc- Ewin) made the cynical remark of tlie year when he said "These matters should not be subject to any political favours". The State Industrial Commis sion recently rejected trade union claims that would give SA workers similar long ser vice leave to that of workers in NSW who had campaigned and won, by legislation, pro rata leave after five years. The Commission in S.A. which has only recently been set up by I the Labor Government made a decision that corresponded with the requests of the employers. In condemning the Commis sion's decision, at the time, the SA Tribune stated that — "Sole reliance on Arbitration without the political and, where neces sary, industrial activity by the workers and their organisations will achieve nothing. The present situation has arisen because the private Members' Bill is aimed at freezing long service leave at 13 weeks after 15 years and . pro-rata (under certain condi tions) after 10 years. This would have 'the effect of pre venting unions obtaining any better provisions than this in any subsequent court applica- I tions.
