 A CHANGE OF HEART ON CIVIL RIGHTS "piLL 1957, notes Schlesinger, Johnson voted against every Civil Rights bill to aid the Negroes, jf even the mild Truman measure of 1948. He voted for the notorious Taft-Hartley Act which allows the state to intervene in a union election to bar militant candidates irom standing. This was too reactionary even for Truman, who vetoed it. But the Congress, with Johnson's support overrode the veto. The US unions are still campaigning to rescind the Act. , These were among the reasons why a Labor delegation which came tc the Democratic Convention of 1960 to interview Kennedy about the vice-presidential nomination were "startled" when they heard it was to be Johnson, notes Schlesinger. The Labor men said they had been able to get support for Kennedy (while preferring Adlai Stevenson) only because of a "guarantee that Johnson would not be on the ticket." Qne of the Labor men was Arthur Goldberg, now US Ambassador to the UN, who said that AFL chairman George Meany, himself a noted Rightwinger, would be "unhappy" over the choice. Schlesinger says that when Johnson's nomination was announced to the convention it was "stunned." and the word "double-cross" was heard amid' "turmoil" and signs of an open revolt on the floor. Balloting began, but by the time Michigan was reached in the alphabetical roll-call of states a delegate moved that Johnson be nominated, by acclamation. "A roar came from the hall, mingling "ayes" and "nays", it seemed to me, in equal proportion, but Governor Collins promptly declared it had been carried" says Schlesinger
