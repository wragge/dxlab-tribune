 Not exactly an egg -head â€” or a lover of Negroes WHAT Johnson seems to have gained mainly from . his schooling is an antipathy to book learning and intellectual activity of any kind which persists to this day. He never reads anything but state papers and newspapers. Hi,s admiring biographer, Booth Mooney, (in The Lyndon Johnson Story) records that, having completed his schooling Johnson frustrated his parents' wish to send him to college by organising a holiday tour for himself to the West Coast. However, hard toil with his hands under the Texas sun made him think there might be some advantages in brain- work after all, and it was with this in mind that he allowed his mother to enrol him at a teachers' college. However politics soon drew him away from teaching. And Mooney notes that he entered politics under . the aegis of none other than Robert Kleberg, part owner of the famous King Ranch and breeder of the Santa Gertrudis cattle. Beef baron Kleberg was no admirer of progressive politics and it is quite understandable that Johnson should have functioned for so long as part of the Republican-Dixiecrat coalition which to this day blocks progressive labor and civil rights legislation. When he married Claudia Taylor (Lady Bird is, of course a nickname) daughter of a Texas landowner and businessman, Johnson married money. It was Mrs. Johnson who bought the "LBJ" radio station which helped make Johnson wealthy.
