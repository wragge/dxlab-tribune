 Lovable IVl old TEXAS J7VEN in Texas he stood out as a diehard. Texas is a state where, as John Gunther noted in Inside America, you can get rattlesnake sandwiches and, though robbery with firearms is a capital offence, murder may not be (a situation of which another noted son of Texas, Jack Ruby) is taking advantage). It is a state dominated by the barons of oil and beef, where racial arrogance is seen at its worst. Gunther recalled that in the 194G's, when liberalism was at a high tide elsewhere the University of Texas barred Negroes and evaded a High Court ruling by building a separate college for Negroes. As Time magazine noted "To avoid sitting next to a Negro in class, Texans are willing to spend $3,500,000". (No protests from Johnson are on record. "He is not what you'd call a Negro-lover", wrote Gunther.) Into this race-ridden society Johnson was born, the son of a well-to-do farmer and state congressman, on August 27, 1908. [?]
