 3 YEARS' SLOW BURN JS Vice - President, says Theodore White, John -son "went through three years of slow burn." Though given some public relations jobs, he was removed from the centre where the de cisions were made. He disagreed with Kennedy on Civil Rights and especially on the decision to sell Ameri can wheat to the USSR, which he called "the worst politic?! mistake we have made in for eign policy during this admin istration". When, 10 days before he died, Kennedy called a top- level party meeting to plan his 1964 campaign, Johnson was not there and stories passed round that he wbuld be dropped. According to one of his bio graphers, Kennedy planned that month to review the Viet nam commitment. He was only in favor of it as long as he thought the Vietnamese were willing to do the fighting.
