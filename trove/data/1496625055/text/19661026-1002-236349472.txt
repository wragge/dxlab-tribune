A joint meeting of ACSPA, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the High Council of Commonwealth Public Ser vice Organisations will be held to discuss the campaign. Rejection Last August the three nation al organisations met Prime Min ister Holt on the leave claim. The Government's decision last week was its second re jection of the claim within 12 months. White collar workers are pressing for it to be made an election issue in seats held by Government Ministers, includ ing those held by Treasurer McMahon. and Labor Minister Bury. The NSW Government, two years ago (then Labor) granted four weeks' leave to State Pub lic Servants.
