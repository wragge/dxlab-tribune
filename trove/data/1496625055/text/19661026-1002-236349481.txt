 War on. war 'SMASH down the cities. Knock the walls to pieces. Break the factories and cathedrals, warehouses and homes Into loose piles of stone and lumber and black burnt wood: You are the soldiers and we command you. Build up the cities. Set up the walls again. Put together once more the factories and cathedrals, warehouses and homes Into buildings for life and labor: You are workmen and citizens all: WÂ© Command You.' FOR THE PEACE, OF THE NATION WE GOTTA GO TO WAR. nights when i heard that woman sigh as she tied her scarf in her hair i hid away on pillow-dreams so's i couldn't hear her say . . . smash down your homes . . . build up your homes "... smash down your homes i command you. she was a lover to the men who came back and said . . . i am a killer, yes ... i come from killing - i go no more. (no one heard her laugh. no one heard the lie.) / it's all real now. the sons of her and the men who came back they say ... mother give me suck, give me war. i ivatch the sand with her head between her naked knees crying and waiting for the blood and the rape and the time when she will hold only the shadows listening to the words of wise men and a poet's cry ... and for what people? for ivhat? j. adams
