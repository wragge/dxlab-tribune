 'PAPER REVOLUTIONARIES' It is of some interest in Australasia that Fidel Castro classed as "really shameful" the fact that the Chinese leaders had given, out "instructions to their hucksters throughout the world, to a handful of hucksters, to set off a chain of lies and slanders about our Revolution . . . pap, suitable only for ignoramuses, suitable only for sheep which move by conditioned reflexes." (He was referring to a number of individuals, including E. F. Hill, of Melbourne, whose published statement that Fidel Castro had "sold himself to the U.S. imperialists" was among those noted in Cuba.) _ And Castro went on: "Who are these mouthpieces? Cheap revolu tionaries, theoreticians of a revolutionary war that they will never make, people who have never fired a shot and never will fire a shot, Those are the hucksters of the leaders of the People's Republic of China . . . paper revolutionaries. , ."
