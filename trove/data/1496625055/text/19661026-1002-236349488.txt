Calwell, Federal Labor Leader, told a press conference in Canberra on Saturday morning that President Johnson had no doubts about the Labor Party's policy on Vietnam. This followed a 40 minute discussion on Vietnam that he and some of his colleagues had with President Johnson. At the conference Mr. Calwell again confirmed, that opposition to conscription would he a num ber one issue for the Labor Party in' the election campaign. This follows a survey in 15 elec torates carried out for the Labor Party by veteran Australian poli tical observer, Don Whitington. The survey revealed that there was' very strong support in the electorates for opposition to con scription and for some control of rising prices. When Mr. Calwell revealed Mr. Whitington's preliminary finding at last week's meeting of the Labor Caucus, Dr. Patterson agreed that a recent survey in his own elec torate had confirmed that opposi tion to conscription was a winner. Liberal party organisers in the electorates are sending in reports that women voters this time are making the conscription issue an emotional question. The Liberal party is also well aware that in the blue ribbon seat of Kooyong when conscription be came the number one issue the party declined by 7.3 per cent in votes. Casualties among Australian lads In Vietnam, including conscripts have increased considerably since then. There are hundreds of thousands of women voters whose sons in the next few years are liable to be conscripted and killed in Vietnam or similar wars.
