 Legal rookery J HAVE just contacted the victim of a car accident whose case is typical of those whose legal advisers are flooding the Supreme Court insisting on a jury (the case takes longer and the fees are higher). This man has been waiting for two years now and does not know when his case will be heard. The orthopaedic surgeon attending him will not re move the pin . in his leg until two or three months before the hearing â€” the doctor does not want to wait for his money. A public hospital would not treat him now he is a "Court' Case". The victim's legal advisers are blaming the Government Insurance Office for the delay. Contrast this with English procedure where usually an experienced clerk has his little notebook of decided cases listing nature of in jury, age and amount of verdict. The whole case is settled without benefit of Bar, generally in two or three months. None of these Q.C.'s are worth their inflated fees in such a case where liability is not in dispute; and they try. to make up by abusing their privileged position in "sensational" advocacy.
