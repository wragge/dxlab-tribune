 Aborigines over-stressed T WOULD like to make some constructive criticisms on the articles in Tribune (Sep tember 7) and the nrevious issue. While I agree that the Aboriginal question reflects no credit on our Government or the trade union movement as a whole, does it warrant so much attention? To place go much emphasis on the strike of 200 Aborigin al workers in the far North is to me both one-sided and not typical of Australian life. As an active worker at GMH, I know that this sub ject is not discussed and Tribune helps to overcome this. But do you think your policy is correct when you completely ignore the fact that GMH sacked, at the same time as the Aborigines strike, 700 workers? The sackings are concern ing 20,000 GMH workers. It took a three weeks' strike in 1964 for 20,000 workers to get as much space as the present Aboriginal struggle. Tribune should aim con sistently to be a. paper of the people and not place so much emphasis on minority groups. We certainly won't defeat the Holt Government in the Federal elections on the Ab original, Rhodesia, Indonesia, Syria, Korea and other in ternational issues, but only on what is happening here n Australia to the majority of the people.
