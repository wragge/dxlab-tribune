 Homework on our own sectarianism needed Misleading caption rpHE photo and caption ' appearing on the front of your October 5, 1966, issue demand an apology. The Library "Sit-in" was not connected with any dem onstrations concerning Viet nam; several of the students photographed (do not follow your t policy on this matter; your reporter was given sufficient facts, and saw enough of the "Sit-in" to make any inference connect ing the two a libel. Accordingly, I request an apology for the misuse of your reporting privilege, libelling the students con nected with the "Sit-in" and those photographed. j. lrisn, University of NSW Students' Union, Library Officer. (The caption in question read as follows: "Australian university students are this week demonstrat ing in most States their opposition to conscription in Vietqam. The demonstrations follow a series of student actions in several States last week demanding better lib- , rary facilities. Pictured are some of the hundreds of students at the sit-in at the NSW University." We think that the caption indi-. cates sufficiently clearly the fact that the sit-ins were separate from Vietnam demonstrations. We do not consider that the sit-in stud ents were "libelled" in any way, but it the caption was considered misleading or in any way caused epneern to those pictured, we offer t,hem — and Mr, Irish — our sincere apologies. — Editor.)
