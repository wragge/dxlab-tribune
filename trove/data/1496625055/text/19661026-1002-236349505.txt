 I A line on I I gas costs J ADELAIDE: The statement recently by a spokesman of the SA Gas Co. that the reticulation of natural gas would not be sig nificantly cheaper than present town gas for probably "five to ten years" warrants im mediate action by the Government. The relatively heavy expense of the pipe-line from Gidgealpa to Adelaide, in the long run will be paid for by the people irrespective of whether finan cial help comes from the Fed eral Government or whether the State is forced to find the money. In these circumstances it will be a blow to State resources arid the people's needs if a private company reaps the main benefit for an indeterminate and most likely an unlimited period. ' The Chief Engineer of the SA Gas Co (Mr. J. P. Burnside) said on his return from exam ining overseas gas. conversion systems that the company would have to "amortise" the conversion of gas appliances (in other words the consumers pay). This statement came at a press conference after he had said that the costs of conver sion would be met by the com pany! The Government appears (and correctly so) to be resist ing attempts by big business to make profit from building the pipe-line. Equally so it should resist further profits flowing into private hands from the reticulation of what are the state's natural gas resources. The immediate taking over, in line with the declared policy of the labor movement, of .the SA 'Gas .Co and with the neces sary compensation to small bond-holders only would en sure that natural gas is not only speedily made available but also at the cheapest pos sible cost.
