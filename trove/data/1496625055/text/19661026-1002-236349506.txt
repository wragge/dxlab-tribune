 Good series TV/TY congratulations to Channel 2. ABN on its just-concluded series, 100 Years of Marxism. The speakers were mostly non-Marxist, but dealt so berly and responsibly with their subject. Their remarks were attuned to the theme that no other philosophy of the past 100 years has had such an impact on people's thinking. Oddly enough the theme of the last program was "The End of an Ideology." All this seemed to imply was that in the socialist countries, socialism is so; much taken for granted as the best pos sible system that discussion centres less on its merits than on , the best way of applying it. In-the capitalist and newly- developing countries, the series showed, Marxist social ism has an appeal which can only increase as the people's difficulties mount. One of the main speakers taking part was himself a Marxist, Mr. Eric Hobsbawm. The BBC, which sponsored the series, apparently doesn't panic at the idea of such a man being given a hear ing on such a program. Why should the ABC? The series was taken straight from London with out adaptation in any way. A good — one would think an indispensable — follow-up would be an Australian series, with at least one Australian Marxist taking part. Australian socialist, Sydney.
