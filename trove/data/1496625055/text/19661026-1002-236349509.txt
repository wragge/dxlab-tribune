 Brand left under the Arch pERTH: The defeat of the Brand Liberal Government in Parlia ment by 26 votes to 18 on the fate of the old Barracks Archway was remarkable in .many ways. It was the enforcement of the people's wishes on a Govern ment which r. tried to ride roughshod over democratic pro cedures and counted on its Parliamentary majority to rub ber-stamp its actions. The strength of public agita- tion on the issue threw both sides of Parliament into a flur ry and caused a last-minute change of heart in many politi cians. A vote which had seemed a foregone conclusion was revers ed. Members took a long hard look at crowded public gal leries before they crossed the floor. Ten Liberals and three Country Party members de fected. The presence of Town Plan- ner Paul Ritter on the steps of Parliament House the day before to "inform members on the case for retention" of the Arch sent politicians of all parties scurrying into confer ences. On the surface, the issue seemed absurd. How could such \ feeling develop over a few thousand old bricks already scarred by the bulldozers? But the arrogant attitude of the Brand Government - turned the Arch into a. symbol. It gathered together many diverse streams of protest from people of different political opinions. There was the original sec tion who wanted an interesting architectural feature of the State's past preserved. There was the growing section who felt that metropolitan planning is ignoring the needs of ordin ary people. And also a number who did not care a fig for the arch, but resented the bullying and sneaky tactics of Brand. All in all, an extremely in teresting exercise in democracy which could well be applied to bigger issues.
