' M Some ftiflr ones £/ra£ didn't get awag 1" HE theme of most fishing s&ories is usually centred around the | size of the one that got away. This however was not necessary for the TV per- sonalities Bob and Dolly Dyer who just recently broke two Australian rec ords for Marlin off the North Queensland coast near Cairns. Their catches were 738£ and 655 lbs re spectively. I Also in the same, area Mr. Richard Obach caught a 1064 lb black marlin on an 80 lb line to set a world record. Fishing news from Ru mania indicate that if size of fish does not always count, the number caught can really impress. In the recent Rumanian angling championships, Ion Fana, winner of the first heat, "caught 845 fishes in three hours' time". — and he came second! The championships were a trial for the Rumanians liable to be selected for the world angling champ ionships in Britain this month. Fish stories , like the above can only augur a tough time for. the fish. All-round benefit yHAT the way to health and long life is not through the use of certain pills, powders and fizzy drinks was well demon strated in Sydney last week at the introduction of Health Week. At Martin Place, over 100 physically well propor tioned young women gave a display of callisthenics. They were members of the Bjelke Petersen School of Physical Culture. And as if to give cred ence to the benefits of physical exercise theory,, the next day there appear ed in the Sydney Morning Herald, a picture of an energetic old lady of 92 years age. , She was Mrs. Ida Tait of Los Angeles, who said that she had been doing her "daily dozen" for the past 25 . years and felt so good after each work-out, that she "felt like jumping up and down". Each morning Mrs. Tait 1 goes through a routine of 9 push - ups, toe - touchine 0 head-rolling etc. S' I However, with many peo. 9 pie today., the routine of I daily exercise often be- I comes such a bore, when I performed alone, that most I substitute more sleep in stead. Sport provides exercise while maintaining interest and today more people are realising this, though by no means finding it easy 1 to participate, because of | lack; of facilities, cost, etc. 0 .The setting up of sport- 0 ing and cultural centres, is the basis for an. effective national health scheme. Prevention is in the case of health far better than a I-, ui v, clixkx opui tdwioc ia mf more entertaining. Bigger I Olympic 1 teams I -pHE recent report that the Australian Olym pic Federation proposes to limit the. team for the 1968 Mexico Olympics to 180 will be a blow to the ambitions of many ttp- and-coming athletes. 1 This is a drastic reduc- | tion when compared to J the 306 who attended the I Tokyo Olympics and the I 232 who attended the 0 Rome games. | Many sports fans will I see the new move as a I rationalisation of the pos- 1 sible real cause for a | small team — a shortage of | funds. .
