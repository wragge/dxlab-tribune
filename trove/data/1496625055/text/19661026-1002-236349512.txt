 Letters to the Editor j THINK the sort of approach used by H. Gould in his letter (12/10/66) in relation to vhina is objectively a sectarian provocation in direct- opposition to gen eral Marxist thinking as expressed elsewhere by Mr. L. Aarons (ALR Oct., 66). True enough, the Party missed the bus in ,1962 in not joining in the raging in ternational debate on secret- : nanism. One ' could even . the date to 1958, when a handful of Communists warned of the sectarianism of the Chinese Party. If H. Gould was one of the small handful then, and is on re cord on the subject, all honour to him. i. Otherwise, let us continue to do sober and quiet home work on our own sectarian ism and concentrate on the tasks of the present, which includes trying to build some sort of unity in action around Vietnam with a number of Asian communist points of view, which differ from the Australian viewpoint. Let's not emulate the Chinese ritual exorcisms and extremist language with spluttering about "abortions" and blowing trumpets at Jericho in the hope of quickly changing the Chinese or winning over their few outside supporters. Yours for unity, S.C xtuidford (NSW).
