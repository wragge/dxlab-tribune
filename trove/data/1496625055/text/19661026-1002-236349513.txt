 "Pack Parliament": Protest call on wage freeze pERTH: WA Trades and Labour Council has called on trade unionists to pack Parliament House public galleries in protest against the proposed wage freeze by the Brand Government. The Government Bill to take away the Industrial Commis- sion's discretionary power will be debated. Perth's latest rise of 25c in the cost of living over the last quarter should stimulate the campaign against the bill. C.O.L. figures do not take into account the price of fruit and fresh vegetables, which have been particularly high.
