 Bill to curb housing rockets ADELAIDE: Legislation has been introduced by the SA Government designed to deter or pre vent the exploitation of members of the community in sub-standard housing by unscrupulous speculators. In introducing the Bill the Premier (Mr. Walsh) said that owners of sub-standard houses had. been evading the Housing Improvement Act and Exces sive Rents Act by sale, and pur chase agreements, o. Unscrupulous owners, have obtained higher payments by letting agreements. Many cases of hardship have arisen because the so called purchaser failed to meet oner ous contract obligations they had often signed in ignorance. Some people have lost all i heir savings and others were saddled with debts they were finding impossible to meet. Illiterate migrants, anxious to get any kind of accommoda tion even at inflated "rentals" provided easy prey for these speculators, Mr. Walsh said One clause extended the de finition of rent and rental under the Housing Improvements Act to include the supply of domes tic services ip connection witn sub-standard homes. It has been found that own-, ers of such houses were charg ing excessively for the supply of simple domestic services and electricity allegedly con sumed particularly where there were a number of tenants. The Labor Government is to be commended for restricting the activities of unscrupulous speculators. More money from the Federal Treasury for housing would al low many people, now living m sub-standard homes to find bet ter . accommodation and wouia help overcome the current crisis in the building industry- This is yet another reason for a change of Government in the Federal elections on Nov ember 26.
