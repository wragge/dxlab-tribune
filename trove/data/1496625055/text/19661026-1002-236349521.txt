 LIFE WITH FATHER "WHERE'S DADDY", William Inge's play now showing at the Ensemble Theatre at Milson's Point, is described as a "mod comedy". And appropriately, too. Bas- lcallv about, the ouestions of responsibility and real toler ance of other Deoblo and their differences — whether they be of color or sexual habits — it speaks with a refreshingly up- to-date and witty voice. Out-of-work actor Tom (Gary Shearston) — after first reject ing the prospect of fatherhood in a number of elaborately justified reactions — finally comes to accept the full respon sibilities of his marriage to pixie - like Teena (Larraine Gore) . Teena's middle-class mother comes down from the country to see her daughter through her difficulties, only ;to meet a suc cession of shocks to her stereo typed prejudices. Excellently acted and de lightfully produced in-the- round by Hayes Gordon, "Where's Daddy" is one of the most diverting — and instruct ive—offerings of Sydney's cur- rent shows -R.M.
