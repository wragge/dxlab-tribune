 2500 sign protest on Balmain ferry closure DIMLY : About 2,500 signatures of Balmain citizens were gathered in a few days by last Monday to a protest, sponsored by the Firemen's and Deckhands' Union, against a decision to close down permanently the Balmain- Circular Quay ferry service. The decision was made by the private firm, Nicholson Bros., which has operated the service to East Balmain and Balmain for many years. It would leave the thousands of residents of the peninsula dependent for travel to the city entirely on the already con gested Victoria Road highway to Parramatta and Western Suburbs, The customary 1500 daily ferry passengers would be added to present busloads. Union members collected on ine ierries last week and Balmain residents collected 100 last weekend. The union secretary, Mr. D. Henderson, said it was hoped to see the State premier (Mr. Askin) this week and to urge quick government intervention to keep a service going, and its further development with a government-run service of small, fast water-buses. Mr. p. Gregory, secretary of the Balmain branch of the Com munist Party, said this week that many Balmain residents considered the service should be extended to include existing jetties of the Cockatoo Island service at Birchgrove and El liott Street. It should include also a cen tral city alighting point, either at Market Street and Erskine Street or both. Such a , service Mould become a fundamental , factor in solving Balmain traf fic problems, which were threatened by the increased | congestion that , would arise from the plan for containerised I cargo wharves.
