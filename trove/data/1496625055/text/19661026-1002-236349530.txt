 M'BOURNE jfcughsiuff JELBOURNE'S most dramatic action for peace in decades marked President Johnson's short visit to the city on Friday. Two thousand Melbourne University stu dents who had planned a demonstration in Carlton forced a last-minute change of route for the motorcade. In St. Kilda Road the motorcade, travelling ' at 40 miles per hour, swept through a wall of sound as 3000 people booed the main spokesman for aggression in Vietnam. Hundreds demonstrated later at Government House. Eighteen were arrested in all, of whom 10 have been charged with various offences. These included the two young brothers, David and John Langley, who made world headlines by .throwing paint bombs on the parked presidential car outside the million aire Brookes home at South Yarra, where . Johnson was visiting. Many cases of unprovoked police violence against demonstrators have touched off a wave of public indignation. The incidents, in which uniformed police and Australian and American security men were involved, have reinforced long-standing public concern in Victoria at police methods. Seven leaders of various organisations were seeking a deputation to Chief Secretary (Mr. Rylah) to protest against police violence.
