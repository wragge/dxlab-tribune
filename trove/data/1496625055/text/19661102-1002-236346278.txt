 TURN-UP FOR THE BOOKS "THE King" has been head ed: — not by the guillotine but by Charlie West from Cooks Hill with a close — to — 2,000 lead over Maritime's Paddy. Paddy's team is counting on the cabaret they've organised Cor Saturday, November 12, to give them back their overall lead. I think at this stage it's anybody's guess as to the even tual winner! N Jock Hill's team from East Sydney— the most consistent sellers of Tribune I know — added to his total this week with 24 Tribunes sold at Sat urday morning election meet- | ings and 14 on a Sunday morn- I ing canvass. | Waverley candidate Stan Knopman reaped 450 votes from 9 Tribunes sold at Saturday election meetings and Bill Brit- ton has been credited with 6 extra sales at his Saturday street meeting. Jane Tabberer scored 4,000 votes from a special dinner gathering held in Narrabeen last weekend which raised some $40.00 for the Tribune competition. Although I have no details, it's apparent there's some activ ity on the South Coast where Bill Williams from Wharf has taken the lead with over 4,000 extra points since his last score. Interest is growing in the Popular Seller Prizes Cabaret to be held in Sydney Saturday, November 19. Laurie Aarons, C.P.A. General Secretary, will present awards to Sydney's first three place-getters in the competition. Bookings to hand include: 30 from Jock Hill's team, 20 from Bill Britton's, 12 from Madge O'Grady's and 20 I from Boh Greentree's. It looks as though we're on the way to a celebration to honour in a fitting way all those who do the vital job of selling Tribune. For catering purposes, we must have book ings as close as possible to being finalised by Monday, Nov ember 14, so please 'phone your reservations now!
