 TAKE OVER OR SUBSIDISE A MEETING of the employees of Nicholson Brothers last Friday (above) at Balmain, Sydney called on the NSW Government to either subsidise or take over the Balmain ferry services. The company finished operating its ferry services last Saturday. Following last Friday's meeting of 50 members of the Firemens and Deckhands' Union, Coxswain and Drivers' Union and Merchant Service Guild, the company agreed to defer the sacking of nine workers pending negotiations between the unions and Leichhardt I Council representatives with the NSW Premier and Minister for Transport. A resolution carried by the meeting said that if the NSW Government could subsidise Sydney Ferries by $200,000 a year, there was no good reason why a utility to serve the people of Balmain could not he subsidised.
