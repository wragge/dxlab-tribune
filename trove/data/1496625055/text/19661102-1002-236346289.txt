 Power men out for 4 hours C YDNEY : More than 4,000 power house and transmission men throughout NSW held a four-hour protest strike last Friday against the Electricity Commission's failure to grant a $2 a week wage claim. Last Friday's strike was a shortened version of a 24-hour efrilrp whinh wns de- ferred pending further negot iations with the Commission. A NSW Labor Council res olution carried at mass strike meeting declared the Com mission's latest reply "an in sult",, and demanded that the claim be reconsidered and for the Chairman of the Commis sion to meet the unions. Large meetings in Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong called for a stepping up of direct action. The wage claim is based on the recent $2 a week increase won by Sydney County Council workers. A resolution sponsored by the Bunnerong Power House workers was reported to the meeting in Sydney and re ceived overwhelming support. This resolution: Condemned the Commis sion for repudiating an agreement that ex-County Council workers now work ing for the Commission would not work for less pay. Called for continued struggle until claim is won. Called on the union' Broad Committee to bring the salaried section into joint action with the wages staff. Called for a complete over time ban to involve main tenance, operation, trans mission and transport sections. Expressed disappointment that the Broad Committee had changed its earlier de cision for Ja 24-hour stop page.
