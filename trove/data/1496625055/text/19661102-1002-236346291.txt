 First-ever stop -work by nursing sisters JYDNEY : About 300 nursing sisters at Concord Repatriation Hospital, Sydney held a one-hour strike last Wednesday to back up their wage demands. The strike was the first ever held by nursing sisters at a major hospital in Australia. During the stoppage the women protested in the street outside the hospital against a new award which robs them of between, $4 and $10 a week. The sisters issued an ul- Hmohim that thov itrnnld m. VVÂ»V VVJ VTVUAU sign within two weeks unless the award was reviewed. This ultimatum was issued to the Public Service Board, Minister for Repatriation, Fed eral Treasurer and Federal Member for Concord. The women said they would stay on the job on a voluntary basis so that no patients would suffer. The hew award, to come into effect on November 12, abolishes weekend penalty rates. Although the award provides for wage increases ranging from $108 to $187 per year, the abolition of penalty rates would mean that most nurses would lose money. Some sisters have already resigned following an unsec- cessful meeting of the nurses' leaders with the Common wealth Public Service last Fri day in Melbourne, The nurses' anger has been fanned by the fact that they have waited six years for the new award which was handed down by a Public Service Ar bitrator on October 12. They took strike action in the absence of any lead by their unions, the Hospital Em- ployees' Federation and the Australian Nursing Federation. The NSW Nurses' Associat ion has given the girls full moral backing. Mr. L. Hart, secretary of the Association, addressed their strike meeting and praised their stand.
