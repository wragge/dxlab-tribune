 LID ON VIETNAM Thich, a personal friend of militant South Vietnam Budd hist leader Thich Tri Quang and a prominent poet and journalist, was speaking to over 1,200 people attending the Methodist Church "Pleasant Sunday Afternoon" in the Ly ceum Theatre. He is visiting Australia as part of a world tour organised by the International Committee of Conscience on Vietnam, a body encompassing some 10,000 Christian clergymen and Jew ish Rabbi in over 40 countries. He had come t to Australia, I Thich said, "not' to denounce Communism or the USA", but to bring information. The U.S.A., Thich said, was hoping for miiltary victory, but has already suffered a political defeat. . Time was on the side of the I National Liberation Front, he . added. Every day the war con- tinued, was a day in favour of the NLF. The war, he said, was not de fending democracy and free dom. Nor was it true that the NLF existed only- because of terrorism. The peasants were "very pat riotic and ready to listen to nationalism". The NLF had never claimed to be a Com munist organisation, but a nat ionalist movement fighting for eign invaders. Earlier, at a teach-in at the Wesleyan Mission, Thich said that the "basic thing to be done to help the Vietnamese people is to stop the war." "For every soldier in hospital, there are ten innocent civilians, many of them burned by napalm," he said. The Saigon Government call ed all refugees communist re fugees, he said. But actually they were in reality "trying to escape from the war, not from communism." CYDNEY: "The South Vietnamese peasants hate the Americans and their allies," visiting Vietnamese Buddhist monk Thich Nhati Hanh, said here last Sunday.
