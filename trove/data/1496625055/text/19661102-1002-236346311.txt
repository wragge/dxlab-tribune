 THE ENEMY He said the only good enemy was a dead one. He, the Sand-hursted, drilled and over-drilled, Military ack-ack-ademied, red-striped man With the 'moustache. But, who was his enemy, Was he quite sure? He ordered khaki-coated flesh to breast the hail of iron, He ordered massed charges against unbroken wire, He ordered frontal attacks across sticky mud, four feet deep, He ordered that his orders should be carried out, He ordered that if any man retire in dis-order, He should be shot, He ordered that a man should fight until he was killed. He said: We are fighting a war, remember, You and me and the lot of us. We are Fighting a war. He said: When we have killed more of them Than us, we will tally and total the fallen, ; And then we will know we have won. They tallied and totalled the fallen, And they found that he had killed Three times as many of us, As of them. It was just plain Arithmetic, A school-boy could have told you. Well, who was his enemy, Wasn't he quite sure? — Denis Kevans. —rMi 'IMfF|-LLli| " ilium iwimiii -- - i ii ii Tj THE GLORIOUS 28th I ''The Worker", November 2, 1916
