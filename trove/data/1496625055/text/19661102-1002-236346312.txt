 " w and at Kandos AT Kandos, 42 miles north of Portland, a similar situation exists. Two young men who were born in the town said they were leaving with their wives and kids after Christmas. One, a carpenter, is working as a labourer at the cement works. A conversation in a pub, cafe or the RSL. club at Kandos usually drifts into talk about the cement works and the local manager. The men are hostile against the management's heavy handed policies or the promises for improvements that are made and never kept. Th town's population of 2500 rely for their livelihood on work at cement works both at Kandos and Charbon, two miles south. Both wo/ks employ a total of some 600 men. It it; a town with only one doctor — now an aging man — to look after the health of 2500 people. The huge city buildings in Sydney, bridges, highways, dams, in fact all building work depend on these cement workers to produce this basic material. These workers deserve the support of the whole trade union movement to ensure they are paid a proper wage to accord with their service to the whole nation. 4
