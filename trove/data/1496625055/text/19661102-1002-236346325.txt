 The Presidential Passage Johnson was like milk: pasteurised before you see it. The yellow streak down his back wasn't cream rising to the top. Why didn't the radio broadcasts play any of the cheering they said they could hear? Seen in Hyde Park: a Mormon father try ing to take a black balloon away JFrom his under-two-year-old son. When he failed, the father burst the balloon. Oh, well,, he could have napalmed the child. Heard in Hyde Park: "He didn't mean napalm when He said: 'Suffer the little children' In front of the Art Gallery: a well-known Sydney doctor tearing up a woman's banner. When a man challenged him, fisticuffs resulted and the police had to break it up. Neither was charged, later the doctor made an offensive remark to another woman and had his face slapped with a rolled up paper. Just before Pres. Johnson came out of the Art Gallery, a copper began to wonder round "chipping" small groups of teen agers (and ignoring the thousands who were massed and shouting protests). - He arrested one youth, and dragged hire away protesting. Three other youths jumped on the copper from behind and rolled him in the dirt. Well, he bought it. We hope he is satisfied. Congratulations to the sailor who stood at attention on the roof of the Art Gallery for the whole of the ceremony. Ho was the most remarkable man in whole of the Presidential circus. Said one person: "If that's a sample of a President, why don't we write to the USA and cancel the order?" H. J. Sydney.
