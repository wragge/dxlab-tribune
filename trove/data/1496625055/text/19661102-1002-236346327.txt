 PIECE WORKERS FORM A UNION pERTH: The Association of Contract Building Operatives — an organisation of piece workers and sub-contractors — was formed recently to negotiate with employers for better conditions and higher prices for self-employed workers. The need for such an organ- isation was accentuated by the increases paid to wage workers in the building industry recently while piece workers' prices re mained at the same level. Self-employed bricklayers, plasterers and carpenters were responsible for the initial moves to form the organisation. Workers are forced into taking piece work because there is little wages work on housing. The A.B.C.O. will probably be registered as a corporate body until such time as it is possible to register with the Arb itration Court. "We are concentrating on one or two employers, such as Jennings and Perth Construct ion, and withdrawing men and sending them to jobs paying higher prices," said Mr. Henley, Secretary of the Carpenters & Joiners' Union "until the em ployers start to talk about higher prices." Secretary Fletcher of the Bricklayers and Stoneworkers Union said that bricklayers were leaving jobs as they finish their contracts and were not taking others. The shortage of tradesmen should force the price up." As a result of determined negotiation by the Stonework ers Union an increase of 2/- a yard, approximately $4 a week, has been won.
