 (mummmmmamrn .....and boiling oil? THE ultras in the N.S.W. Liberal Party would like to see anti-Vietnam war dem onstrators whipped and placed in stocks as well as losing their Government scholarships and living allowances. The ultras began to pressure the NSW Government immediately after the Sydney demonstrations against Johnson. Their first move was to push through a resolution at the Northern Metropolitan Division of the Liberal Party urging the gov ernment to stop stipends and Government scholarships from students arrested in the anti-Johnson demonstrations. This was followed by Mr. Dunbier, the Liberal M.L.A. for Nepean, who utilized a private motion on vandalism to link the demonstrators with it. "Amongst these demonstrators," said Mr. Dunbier, "were the same types of louts as those who are terrorizing our womenfolk in trains and public places." For these vandals with whom Mr. Dunbier had linked the demonstrators came' his en lightened plea: "I suggest even the reintrod- uction of the whip or the cat-of-nine-tails." A former Chief of Staff of The Daily Tele graph, Mr. Mead, M.L.A. for Hustrville, brought into the debate what the Daily Mirror described as "a finely-honed 13th centuryi Mind." Mr. Mead said: "Sometimes I think that though we have progressed considerably since the Middle Ages, the punishment in those days did fit the crime. "Offenders were then put in stocks and the public could wreak its revenge on them for damage they have done to public property."
