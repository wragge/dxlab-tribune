 Equal pay or more strikes &lt;4"HERE will be more cattle station work ers out on strike in the Territory after April next year (at the end of the wet season) if we don't get equal pay". Northern Territory Aborigines leader Dexter Daniels told pressmen in Canberra last Friday that he had just said this to Mr. Barnes, Minister for Territories, in an interview. He was replying to Mr. Barnes' statement to himself and Captain Major that further changes would come gradually. "But we told him," said Mr. Daniels, "that we had come south to rally support for our demand for equal wages now." "Mr. Barnes said that the Aborigines had been pushed in to the struggle but when you get only $6 for a seven day week, nobody has to push you." The two Aboriginal spokes men met with the Aborigines Committee of the Federal Lab or Party and also addressed a special meeting of the Canberra Trades and Labor Council.
