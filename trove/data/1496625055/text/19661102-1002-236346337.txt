It provided me with financial success, a natural education from travelling the world and nearly everything else I have." These words of "Big Jake" Kramer, the 1946-47 U.S. national champion, 1949 Wimbledon title, holder, and ex-profession al World Champion and promoter (as reported by Martin Lader in the Aus tralian last month) prob ably best sum-up the rea son for the recent report that the Australian tennis star Roy Emerson is now interested in a short term professional career. The best offer to Emer son in the past has been a guarantee of around $100,- 000 for three years playing. The demands made on the playing and domestic life of the professional ten nis player are probably what has caused Roy Emerson to say that he's interested in playing pro fessional for one or two years at the most and that H f the money will have to be I I good. | ; To whip or I not to whip I Swe were writing this I it was about three fl hours from Cup time and I trying to pick the winner 9 B we were wondering about S the controversy that ra&lt;- I ed not long ago on the ex- I A ucooivc uac U1 me Waip by I I some jockeys and evid- f | ence of the effects it has I on a horse's rump were 1 even graphically illustrated 1 in some dailies.

"I 1 always ride that way", J said Miller in his defence. |fS What will they do to Mil- if ler, if he gets "hot" and f I' flogs Galilee home in Cupl \ M — Well; by now you know ®| the answer to that ques- p tion! I1' Safe from 1 i biters i A USSIE Rugby fans will | be pleased to note that | the code is gaining in in- j ternational popularity. In a Soviet Weekly last month, Yury Daineko re ported that this year the | first Rugby competitions 1 on an all-union scale are | \ to be held and a USSR g | Rugby Federation is being | ij formed. 1 Mr. Daineko is vice- I jj chairman of the Moscow I i Rugby Federation. In his article, Mr. Dain- j eko points out: that Rug- j by was taken up in a big j way in the USSR only | after 1957 and that this | year, there are at least g £ 10,000 playing the game. | This is a tremendous in crease considering that: 1 the first Rugby match took | place in the Soviet Union || in 1933 and the whole ?| country at the time didn't boast more than 50 play- J| ers. |f "Chief enthusiasts are || students and army sports- | men, but in many cities | secondary schools are en- | tering teams in the offi- | cial contests", says Mr. g Daineko. I An aspect of the Soviet j Rugby that many Aussie fans would probably agree | with, especially after the l recent commotion over the ear-biting antics of Walla- | by Rugby Union reserve :J hooker Ross Cullen con- | cerns the rules. | Soviet Rugby is conduct- | ed according to the inter- | (national rules, with one | "difference. Grabbing hold p of the head or clothes is | prohibited as it is consi- | Idered necessary to help prevent "dirty play". j It is quite easy to con- j elude that such rules would tend to improve the j standard of tackling and if a player is prohibited from grabbing at the head, then j most likely their _ ears ; should be safe from biters.
