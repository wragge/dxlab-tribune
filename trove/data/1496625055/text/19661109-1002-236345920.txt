 W.A. CARPENTERS KNOCK TOTAL WAGE pERTH: Industrial Commissioner Schnaars' assertion that the only true comparison of wages paid to workers in the various States is by dividing the total wage paid in each State by the number of workers employed, was rejected at the weekend conference of the Carpenters and Joiners' Union. Speakers pointed out that: Over award payments were commonplace in other States but not in Western Aus tralia. This position was aggra- vated still further by the use of penal powers against work ers who engage in industrial action. It was the inalienable right of unions to engage in collec tive bargaining for over-award payments. Awards provide minimum standards only and should not be used to prevent unions from seeking additional entitlements for their mem bers. e Workers have the right to share in the increased profits resulting from technological and other developments. State Government's legisla tion abolishing quarterly cost of living adjustments and adopting the federal basic wage for W.A. was condemned by conference. The move was designed to keep the basic wage at the lowest level and would also have the effect of depriving 80 per cent of workers employed under State awards from being satisfactorily represented when national wage cases are heard. State award workers in W.A. will be further deprived if Commonwealth commissions adopt a total wage principle. Support was given to the W.A. Trades and Labor Coun cil's campaign for the repeal of this legislation and for the de feat of the Brand government. Conference gave whole heart ed support for the Australian Council of Trade Unions' pol icy of changing the Australian trade unions from craft to in dustrial unions and ultimately to the establishment of one union for each industry.
