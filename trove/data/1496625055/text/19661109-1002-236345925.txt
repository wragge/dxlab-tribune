PROTEST TO ASKIN: WATCH ON THE SHIP IMBBBOOm OWNERS I— — CYDNEY: Waterfront watchmen in Sydney are considering a 24- hour stoppage in pro- test against long delays by the shipowners in granting long service leave and attendance money. A stopwork meeting of 250 watchmen last week in Sydney decided to move for a strike failing a satisfactory reply to their demands within 21 days. The Miscellaneous Workers' Union has been asked to im mediately open negotiations with the shipowners. A strike of Sydney water front watchmen would involve 600 men. The men say that the average daily unemployment of watch men is between 80 and 100. These men are obliged to make themselves available for work seven days a week and do not receive appearance money if work is not available. The attendance money and ' service leave claims have been negotiated sirilce 1963 and the men say they can no longer rely on the "goodwill of the shipowners to grant these es sential conditions."
