Over 74 million tons of grain have been despatched to- delivery centres despite patchy weather conditions. "Never before has so much grain been procured in this country" says Pravda. After noting fine results in other branches of, agriculture Pravda says: "Now it can be said confidently that a steady supply, of staple foods to the population is securely guar anteed." Among errors in agriculture now being corrected are those resulting from reduction in the size of farmers' private plots, which in the six years 1958-64 caused production from these plots to fall by 8 per cent. Cattle in personal use by farmers rose last year by 2,800,000; pigs by 3,700,000. In the summer of this year farmers' market prices fell by an average of six per cent throughout the USSR as com pared with 1964, while falls in prices of potatoes, lard, meat and eggs ranged from 11 to 32 per. cent. At many of these farmers' markets, where private selling is the rule, prices for agric ultural products have now fallen to the same level as prices in state shops and sometimes are even lower.
