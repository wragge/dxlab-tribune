 Vietnam 'more than local war' From Rupert Lockwood OSCOW: American operations in Vietnam are "far in excess of the scope of a local war," a Pravda article warns. Bridgeheads are being pre- pared "for extending US ag- gression against the peoples of Asia generally". This warning fits New York Times military correspondent Hanson Baldwin's advice that "South Vietnam, Laos, Cam bodia and Thailand should be viewed as a strategic entity". Pravda commentator Yury Kharlamov says "the scale of military and civil engineer ing construction which Wash ington has now launched is far greater than would be called for an expeditionary corps of even double the strength of that currently stationed in Vietnam." Multi-purpose strategic bases — naval, military and air force — have been built with oil and amunition storages and road and rail communication. American base construction in Thailand runs into billions of dollars' expenditure. France Presse notes talk in official circles about the possibility of B52 strategic bombers being based in Thai land. Senator Fulbright told the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee. "We ought to ask where we . are heading for. Won't Thailand prove to be r. second Vietnam?" Activities in Laos and on the Cambodian frontier all re inforce fears that Vietnam's conquest is sought to provide the bridgehead for further . wars of conquest under the Pentagon's "Asian doctrine".
