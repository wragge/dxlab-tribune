 Werriwa firms go foreign C YDNEY : Mr. L. Kelton, Communist candidate for the NSW seat of Werriwa in the Federal elections, said last week that industries in the elec torate are extensively foreign owned, with Americ- an companies the most dominant among them. "This is yet another re minder to the people of in creasing foreign ownership of their national resources," Mr. Kelton said. These companies had be tween 1953-65 netted $130 billion and all but three per cent of this had left Australia, he said. "One of the policy points I make i,s the need in the people's interests, for a Gov ernment take-over of selected foreign industries with heavy taxes on others. "Most of the industries in the Werriwa electorate come into this category," Mr. Kel ton said. He added that when the Treasurer, Mr. McMahon, had brought down his Budget this year he had said that health and social services were among benefits to suffer from the increased war expenditure, now $1000 million. "People in the Werriwa electorate are certainly among the most chronic of these sufferers," Mr. Kelton said. "In the Mt. Pritchard, Green Valley and- Hill View districts hundreds of thousands of people have moved into new housing areas. "Hence, there is a crying need for expanding public services that cannot be met from State revenue, but they arc almost non-existent." "Hospital facilities have stood still despite the popu lation explosion as has the school building program. "According to the Australian Education Council there is an acute shortage of classrooms in Werriwa," Mr. Kelton said. The electors of Werriwa could only gain by support ing a Communist candidate whose policy is for a dras tic cut in war spending so that the money could be diverted to essential services for the people, he said. "An end to the Vietnam war is a first step in this direction," he added. J. LES KELTON, CPA .candidate for Werriwa.
