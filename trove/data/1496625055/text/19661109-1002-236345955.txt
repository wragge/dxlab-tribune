 LBJ's FLOP: CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE Letters to the Editor j ACCORDING to US Time Magazine (24/10/66), the large scale protests against US and Australian Govern ments' aggressive policy in Vietnam, made in Melbourne and! Sydney during President John son's visit, resulted from the joint efforts of Mel bourne and Sydney com munists. The interesting aspect con cerns its report that "Austra lian Intelligence reported that, they had intercepted mes sages from Melbourne Com munists advising sympathisers in Sydney on how to disrupt - the President's visit. On behalf of all Sydney Communist officials let it be stated that no messages, per sonal, 'phone or written were made on any question, in the period referred to, from any source in Melbourne. It is acknowledged that "Security" opens mails, taps 'phones and listens in to private conversations but no statement was reported in Australia of their activities on the occasion of L.B.J's visit. To what American source- did Australia's Intelligence re port? It is proclaimed by the U.S.A. that its espionage organisation, the Central In telligence Agency, operates . in every country. Was the C.I.A. responsible for the false re ports emanating from the American Press? The Sydney Morning Her ald's editorial of 25.10.66 is undoubtedly correct in show ing that the failure of the Sydney programme for L.B.J. rests with the Government and Security and not with the demonstrators who sought to protest and proclaim their vjWP Tliv. S.M.H's more accurate assessment stands in great contrast to the wails, inaccur acies and hysterics of the U.S. Time Magazine. J. R. Hughes, Sydnev.
