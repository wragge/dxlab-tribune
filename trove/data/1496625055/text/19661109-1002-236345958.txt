 An unanswered Manila question ANBERRA :The recent Manila Conference did not articulate clearly what would be the one defensible motive of Australia, the US and other powers in Vietnam, Mr. K. Beazley, (Lab.) said in- the debate in Parliament last week on Prime Minister Holt's statement on the conference. - '"yHIS is that the people of South Vietnam should be free to establish their own government, free from any coercion or terrorism, even if that Government is totally un acceptable to us." Mr. Beazley said. "Supposing the people elect a Communist Government. Is this to be accepted? If there is an election will there be Com munist candidates?" he asked. "I do not want to see such a Government established there, but I am not sure whether we can do anything permanently if we are going to turn ourselves into a holy alliance and say what sort of government we are going tp establish there." Mr. Beazley said any govern ment established by the use of napalm against villages— "by the intervention of outside forces using napalm, which certainly strikes at civilians in villages'.' — would never he per manently accepted in Vietnam. Mr. . Beazley made his criti cisms in discussing the pros pects of what he called "the Manila policy of winning over the Vietcong". For this, he said, there had to be a proper assessment of the Vietcong as a force. "Why have they been able to hold together for as long as they have in the face of a massive assault from the great est military power on earth, the greatest military power of all time?"
