 Maximum penalty for first offences pERTH: Sentencing by a magistrate last week of I three youths to the maximum penalty on a malicious damage charge has disturbed democratic opinion here. The three young men, after some drinking, threw a bottle through a city shop window containing pictures of President Johnson because of their dis approval of American policy in S.E. Asia. It is contrary to normal practice to fine first offenders the maximum or keep them in custody. (The youths were held for . 24 hours before being sen tenced and an hour afterwards, until the fine was paid.) At the same time as these youths were fined $50 and $51.75 damages each, another youth who fired a rifle several times in a plush Perth suburb while intoxicated was fined only $20. Critics of Magistrate Smith, while not condoning the bottle- throwing incident, which was apparently a spontaneous out burst, say that usually only out and out vandals would have got the maximum. Mr. Smith then said he would interview "security police" to find out if the youths belonged to any organisation. He later retracted this re mark.
