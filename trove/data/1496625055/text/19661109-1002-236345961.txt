 Patriotic duty AS a non-communist read er, I congratulate you on your efforts to establish the truth, particularly in regard of the Vietnam war and in revealing the distortions of facts by the governments of Australia and the USA. To me it seems remarkable that to an ever increasing ex tent the voice of conscience can be heard in a communist newspaper. This is utterly dif ferent from what we are taught to believe about the "Reds". When, while commenting on the Johnson visit, even the more neutral press yielded to undue enthusiasm. Was it be- cause they were afraid to lose readers if they would disclose the gimmick character of this event? They certainly disappointed those of their readers who duly expected more than soft talk on the right of dissent. It was before this background of' "iramon retreat from . journalistic duty that Trib une and the thousands of de monstrators f?>of Hyde Park and Art ' Gallery fulfilled a truly patriotic duty. I mean the duty of think ing and responsible Austra lians who realise that this country is part of Asia and that there will be a day when our Asian neighbours will judge us by what we have done for the sake of peace and prosperity in this region. Because let's face this: For all the official enthusiasm for LBJ and for our total com mitment to the warmongering cause of U.S. politics, it is only this very same president who praises us, not the peo ples of Asia.
