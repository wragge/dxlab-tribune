 Inspired by the inspired LAST week we gave special thanks to a long- 1 standing Tribune supporter who'd been "in- 1 I spired" — as he- put it — by the frequent donations I to this paper's fighting fund of our old friend 1 I DRAY. | This week we're proud —and grateful— to include DRAY himself once again among our list of donors. Apparently he's been re- inspired by those whom he's inspired himself. Many thanks to the many who-ve helped to contribute nearly forty dollars this week to keep the fund creeping towards the $3000 goal. Maybe this is a bit pre mature,. but j,t'd be a great thing to reach the target I in one glorious go. All we i need is another $155. | Any takers? 8 This week: I W.R. $3J)0, C.S. $2.00, I Dom per P.O. 30c, STUC 30c, Gymea Pub & Club Readers $12.84, Eddy Ave. 80c, Trades Hall 50c, Dom gate 20c, Trib Stand Ash- field 50c, Canterbury Sta tion 30c, A.M. 22c, Kevin Town Hall 30c, R.L.
