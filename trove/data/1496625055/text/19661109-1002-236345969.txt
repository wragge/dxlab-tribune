 Not-so-greafr leader /mmmarnm mvun TyHAT makes President Johnson so remarkable and what has he done to qual ify him for the title of "lead er of the free world"? It surely cannot be his op position in practice to the Goldwater policy that he so strongly condemned at the time of his election. Neither can it be for his solution of the problem of the 17 million American peo ple who went to bed hungry every night, during the elec tion campaign and still do. Nor can it be L.B.J's solution of the problem of the 16 mil lion Negroes, whose fight for democratic rights and the pri vilege to live like human be ings, has almost reached the j stage of civil war. What remedy has President j Johnson put into practice or even proposed that would add to his greatness, for a solu tion of America's crime wave which is getting worse and as one American writer put it, has made the US virtually an armed camp. If willingness to respond to repeated calls of American military men and Marshal Ky, for more American men for the slaughter in the Viet nam war and for its escala tion, then L.B.J, is surely great. . , A visiting industrial Ameri can expert expressed astonish ment when he learned that Australian steel and other in dustries are working at 100 A capacity, while similar indus tries in America are working at only about 60% of capacity- Surely' this does not reflect greatness on the head of & country that has more than five million unemployed ana one third of the world's pap ulation live in poverty.
