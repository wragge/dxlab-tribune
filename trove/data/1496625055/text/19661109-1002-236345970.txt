 Vivid recollections WHEN the 1914-18 war was in progress and Prime Minister Billy Hughes tried to bring in conscription, my husband (J. Hartley, Snr.) and I went among the crowds at the Domain every Sunday delivering papers and leaflets opposing conscription. We be longed to the IWW movement and were frequently warned by the police. Two of my brothers in Western Australia, Alfred and George Callaman, were gaoled for speaking against conscrip tion. Although I am on in years, I still have vivid recollections of those days, my ideas are the same now, regarding war and conscription. (Mrs) M. Hartley, Balmain, N.S.W.
