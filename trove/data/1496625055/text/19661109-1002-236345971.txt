 Save us from Harold T BEAD with interest the reports, on the activities of the Un-American Com mittee at present being iormea Dy a warnawx irom Texas, Joe Pool. No doubt LBJ will give this organis ation his whole-hearted bles sing. The function of this body will be to impose the most severe penalties on those who oppose Johnson's war policy and to silence all criticism of his administration. I predict if Mr. Holt and his Liberals are voted back into office then it won't be long before we have an Un- Australian Committee which will have the same function as the one set up in America. All I can say is we will need help if the Liberals are left in power for another three years. The people ; will pay dearly if such a mistake is made and we have paid enough already.
