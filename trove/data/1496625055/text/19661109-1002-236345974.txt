 TURNING INTO THE STRAIGHT By Gloria Sanderson AS we turn into the straight for the final ten days of the competition, my only comment is "it's a pity they ' can't all win!" There are so many excellent efforts being made to develop Tribune finance and sales that every one of our competitors and their supporters deserve re cognition. Charlie West never ceases to surprise with his contribution. This week he sent in a further $200 which puts him some 13,000 ahead in the national competition. Paddy King put in 6 annual subscriptions to increase his total by 6,000. . (Incidentally, I heard that Paddy himself has been selling up to 11 dozen Tribunes each week — canvass ing right through from Wed nesday till the following Tues day.) Jock Hill and his supporters sold 60 papers last weekend at street meetings and a Sunday canvass and, in addition, Jock himself sold 42 more than he normally does each week! It's obvious that South Aus tralian entrants are putting on the pressure for the final stage and it looks like the girls win ning the race there! DON'T FORGET — FINAL POINTS FOR ALL CANDI DATES MUST BE AT 168 DAY STREET, SYDNEY, BY 12 NOON FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 18 TO BE ELIGIBLE.
