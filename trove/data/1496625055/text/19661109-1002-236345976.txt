 All-American Australia rpRIBUNE has drawn attention to the existence of the "Defend Australia Committee". What is this we have in our midst? The Establishment's answer to the AICD, VAC and other progressive bodies? Perhaps, finding itself em barrassed by the AIGD's in disputable evidence as to its policy of horror, it has felt it necessary to create an alternative, calculated to appeal to the chauvinistic and reactionary elements. It offers not peace, but WAR. To them, it appears, war is acceptable (provided we get in first) "Better dead than Red" they cry. Yes, they would sooner see us all dead before we went red. What can we expect from this chauvinism? Persecution of critics, suppression of opposition, economic con- scription of conscientious objectors. Those that advocate peace, they say, are nothing but communist stooges. So apparently we have our choice; to be a communist stooge 'or an American stooge. Judging by what they say, the day may be coming when Peace will be a dirty word. The advent of such an organization with its accom panying Philistine mental aims, ostensibly, at "Advance Australia". Its real effect is to subordinate Australian culture to that of our "Esteemed Ally". Finally we end up with All American Australians. H. B. Austin, , Henty (NSW).
