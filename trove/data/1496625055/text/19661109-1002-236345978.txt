 [?] Public servants against Holt X President of the Australian Council of Salaried and Professional Associations, Mr. P. Allsop, forecast this week that many Commonwealth public servants who normally voted for government candidates would this time vote against the government. "This is because they know that they have no prospect of obtaining four weeks' annual leave and equal pay for at least another three years if the pre sent government is returned," he said. "Feeling against the govern ment is very high in N.S.W. be cause Commonwealth public servants are working near State public servants who have had fftllP urnnlrei Ioavm 4.1 a ---- ivftvc J.V1 LUC? two years. "The reason given by Mr. Holt for refusing to grant our leave claim (that this would require an increase of 5800 to the work force) is utter rub bish," he said. ; "When Commonwealth pub- l he servants take their annual leave now, there is no special Pool to take their place and the normal staff takes up the slack. "Mr. Holt has been made ful- fy aware by our organisation that, according to NSW Public Service Board figuves, no addi- tional staff were required fol lowing the introduction of four weeks leave. "In fact, due to increased productivity arising from mod ern technological developments, the rate of increases in staff in the N.S.W. service declined in spite of the introduction of four weeks' leave. "The same thing would hap pen in the Commonwealth pub- lic service because it is appar ent . from productivity figures available that the increase in efficiency of the service over a period of twelve months would more than outweigh the two per cent loss in working hours." Mr. Allsop said that a joint committee of his organisation plus the High Council of Com monwealth Public servants and the A.C.T.U. had planned a campaign to acquaint all Com monwealth Public servants with the situation. â€” H.
