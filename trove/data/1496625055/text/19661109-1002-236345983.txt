 Boomeranging back pROMINENT Aborigines in Sydney are up in arms over a white man being selected to represent Australia in boomerang throwing at the coming Canadian World Fair. A protest letter has been sent to the daily newspapers. Sydney wharf ie Charlie Dixon (above), who initiated the protest, told Tribune last week that "we have been pushed into the back ground too long." Mr. Dixon, who is an executive member of the Foundation of Abor iginal Affairs, said that a white man, Frank Donnellan, was to represent Australia at the Fair. "Joe Timbery, from La Perouse, is a champ â€” I've seen him catch a boomerang on his head. "He's so good that Donnellan took him on r, world tour," Mr. Dixon said. "You connect a jockey with a horse, an Eskimo with snow and an Aborigine with a boomerang. "It is absolutely ridiculous that anyone but an Aborigine should be invited to throw boomerangs at the fair," Mr. Dixon said.
