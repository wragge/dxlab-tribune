 THE EIGHT -LETTER STRIKE CYDNEY: An eight-letter word is the real reason why a builders labourers' delegate was sacked and also why his mates forced his reinstatement last Friday in Sydney. "Militant" is the real objectionable word — with double the strength of any four-letter swear-word in most employers' books. And E. A. Watts, the builders of the 25-storey Sydney County Council project, proved they were no exception. Then there is that disgusting hyphenated word, "job-organisation", which if mixed with "militant" is enough to bring down any employer's wrath. But young John Dempsey was not sacked for these reasons but because he allegedly swore at a foreman. The subterfuge is so ludicrous it's hilarious, but it gave the dailies the opportunity for a field day about the so-called "four-letter word strike." But the workers on the job knew the score: they came out on strike, more than 100 of them — builders' labourers, carpenters and other tradesmen. As Builders' Labourers' Union Secretary, Mick McNamara said: "It was an attack on job-organisation. They have been after John for some time and the workers knew thai if the company got away with this sacking, other delegates and militants would be next to go." This job-organisation has forced the company to maintain proper safety standards and provide proper amenities, has prevented past victimisation and gained increased wage rates. This is enough to make any boss swear! The spelling's slightly awry, but the point comes right from the heart — two New Australians demonstrating on the S.C.C. project last week. (See below).
