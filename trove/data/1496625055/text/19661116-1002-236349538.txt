 PUT YOUR MONEY ON j CHARLIE! By Gloria Sanderson I AT this stage Charlie West E is definitely odds-on I favourite to take out the j national prize. In fact, he 1 could well top the two hund- I red thousand mark between I now and 12 noon Friday. I It may be just woman's in tuition — sometimes right, sometimes wrong — but I be lieve we'll be hearing more of Paddy King before the final votes are counted. He certainly has the job in front of him to overtake Charlie West but there's a, real "eager beaver" committee flat out on his be half. Jock Hill has a tight grip on that second position in Sydney. On election canvasses and street meetings last weekend his group sold 80 extra Tribunes and in volved one more seller in handling 5 Tribunes each week. They must have sold some hundreds of extra Tribunes in the course of this campaign. We'll let you know the exact figure in the summary to be published soon after the close of the competition. The South Coast are putting on a close struggle with Bill Williams this week headed by Rus Critcher. No-one is keen to make a prediction about the eventual winner there — they'll see what happens at the prize presentation at the South Coast Tribune Ball next Friday night. A FINAL REMINDER— ALL VOTES MUST BE RECORDED AT 168 DAY STREET, SYD NEY, BY 12 NOON NEXT FRIDAY.
