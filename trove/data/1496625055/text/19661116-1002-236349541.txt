 Pirates and a baa of aold | "JHE most important thing to remember about Sydney New Theatre's children play, "Pirates at the Barn," is that it is performed and directed by young people — the whole cast being I under ,27 — with the exception of Frank Curtain, who plays | Samuel Snizzle. j 'Pirates at . the Barn", writ ten by Australia's Eleanor Wit- combe, is set outside a barn, m Mosman's Bay in 1839. The' barn belongs to Black Bill Bluster (Lionel Haft), a whaler-cum-pirate, who has stolen a bag of gold from Hob- art and spirited it up to Syd- ney. And it is this bag, of gold that 1S the pivot of the play. Kathy (Maria Iwanoczko), the heroine of the play who is stood over by a detestable shrew, Amelia (Mary Bryan) and Michael, a timid apprentice cooper (Paul Quinn) need the I gold so that they can escape from Amelia and Samuel Sniz zle and run away to Sydney. | Samuel and Amelia also want | the gold for their own selfish ! ends. In a too-drawn-out ending, the question is solved, with the gold going to Michael and Kathy, and Michael aoihg into the Navy, as had always been his dream. Overall the play 'is a great success. "It is written," says Director, Eric Long, "on two planes, and can be enjoyed by all, young and old alike." The awards for the best ac tors should go to Maria Iwan oczko, Paul Quinn and Malcolm Matheson (the stranger who lends a helping hand). The play is well worth see ing and crystallises a lot of fine, hard work by all involved. It is the ideal Xmas treat for Mums and Dads and kids as weil.- -N.
