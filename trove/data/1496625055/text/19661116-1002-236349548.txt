 XMAS GIFT AT G'VILLE -SACK! By a Rolling Stock worker CYDNEY: In just over a week 37 workers have been retrenched from Commonwealth Engineering at Gran ville in Sydney. Those sacked include boiler- makers, ironworkers, sheet- metal workers, fitters, painters and carriage builders. The retrenchments are being staggered to dispel any impres sion of drastic lay-offs, but the pattern is there. If the company doesn't get new rolling stock orders, it is expected that sackings will be widespread. Japanese Tenders for 55 stainless steel carriages for the NSW Railways are due to close 'on November 24 â€” two days before the Federal Elections. It is widely known that Jap anese interests are making a bid for these contracts with &\ cut-price quote. This should not be allowed, to happen, particularly at a time when Australian firms are cry ing out for work and Austra lian workers are being sacked. At the moment the only work Offering at Commonwealth En gineering is an order for 10 diesel electric, carriages. Shortage Tullocks at Ryde, another rolling stock enterprise, is also retrenching because of a short age of work. With only a few% weeks to Christmas, there won't be much Xmas cheer for the families of those already sacked. The Federal Government can squander $1000 million a year on war but cannot provide rail way rolling stock contracts. The public must be told how this industry has suffered such a disgraceful fate at the hands of Federal and State Liberal Governments.
