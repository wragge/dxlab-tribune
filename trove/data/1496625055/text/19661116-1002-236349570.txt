 A matter of fact TT is sometimes claimed that more people are killed on the NSW roads than in the Vietnam war. Such a remark can only be based on the total of Australians killed, without regard either to the ratio to the population, or taking into account any Ame ricans or Vietnamese people killed. But if we compare the ratios upto October 19 this year, we find that out of a task force of 4,500, there were 69 Aus tralians killed. Our road toll was 874 deaths out of a NSW population of 3 million. If the same rate of slaugh ter had kept up in Vietnam, and we had committed 3 mil lion troops there, our losses would have been 4,600 killed â€”or rather more than the whole of our present task force. The sending, of troops is something' we can control, , by voting to return the Labor Party at the next election. Just because we suffer from a frightening road toll is no reason for sending our boys "over there" to face much greater chances of being kill ed or having to kill. Furthermore, the Askin Government could very well use the services of our boys, and ensure full employment, by providing a vastly improv ed transport system, and re ducing the fares. This was in its election promises, but not performance. If they were zealous in get ting their unserviceable roll ing stock repaired (instead of reducing the numbers of maintenance workers), and providing a frequent and rapid feeder bus service con necting train lines, the travel ling public might be induced to use the public transport more frequently than cars, and so help to reduce the road toll.
