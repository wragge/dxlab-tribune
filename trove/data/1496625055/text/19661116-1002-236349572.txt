 Friendship with China CHINA'S recent announce- ment of the successful test-firing of a nuclear guided missile prompted Sydney's "Teleeranh" (Oct. 31) to re- buke Western "experts" who had persistently underrated China's nuclear progress (as, it might have added, they earlier had underrated Rus sia's). However, instead of coming to the logical, conclusion of urging Australia to become friends with China, the Tele- graph" told the Government to keep its alliances with its "great and powerful friends. Ever since China's first successful atom test in 19&lt;Â« it has been evident that one day China would have a nu clear capability every bit as powerful as the U.S.A. s. (I was, of course, America s threats against China and re fusals to "ban the bomb that provoked China's development of the nuclear weapon.) History teaches us that legions on foreign soil mus go home sooner or later, ana nothing is surer than that the U.S.A. will one day have to withdraw its forces from Asia. If it won't go voluntar ily, China will be powerful endugh to force it to go. Apart from other reasons that can be cited, this is one all-embracing reason why we should be trying now to b friends with China, not limns up in the enemy camp. I hav been trying for years to hav an item along these lines Pub lished in just about every Sydney daily newspaper, out not one, including the ueie" graph," has ever been pr " pared to publish such a letter.
