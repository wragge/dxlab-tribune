 All the way with Arthur CONCERNING President Johnson's Sydney visit, the claim that one million people were present can . be made to look ridiculous. This is one-half of the city's population. The simplest way to give it the lie is to com pare Saturday's crowd with the mass of people going home at 5 pm any work day. . Perhaps more importantly, I would like to offer an elec tion slogan I believe might be valuable. Why not: "ALL THE WAY WITH ARTHUR A". P. Stuart, Sydney.
