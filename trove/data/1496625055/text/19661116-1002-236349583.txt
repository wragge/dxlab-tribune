 Public protests force change in obnoxious Act DELAIDE: Opposition to "loitering" charges brought against Vietnam demonstrators, under the Lotteries and Gaming Act, has resulted in undertakings by the SA Labor Government to re move the obnoxious provisions. Using the Lotteries and Gam ing i Act, the Liberal president of the Legislative Council, Mr. Densley, suppressed Vietnam protests by requesting police to remove demonstrators from the steps of Parliament House, recently. i The Chief secretary, Mr. Shard, said last week that the present Act made is possible for a police officer, without cause, to , order to move on, a citizen going about his business with perfect propriety. This provision was unique in SA said Mr, Shard and had produced much ' public protest and hostile comment from, the Bench. &lt; The Government believed that a police officer should be able to show reasonable cause for interfering with the normal liberty of a citizen, ordering him to move on. The Government Bill will re peal the Lotteries arid Gaming Act provisions on loitering and transfer police powers against loitering to the Police Offences Act. The new Bill provides that a person on request from a police man, was obliged to give reason for his loitering. The Bill also provided that when three or more people were loitering in company in pub lic, a policeman had to show (hat a breach of the peace could occur or that traffic was oeing obstructed before he could order them to move on. "The main object of the Bill Is to retain the principle of the liberty of a person in the ab sence of special consideration," Mr. Shard said.
