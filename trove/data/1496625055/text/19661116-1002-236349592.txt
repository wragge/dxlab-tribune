 WOOL FOR THE BLACK SEA DECK scene of the Soviet ship Dolmatova, which last week loaded 15,000 bales of wool in Fremantle. She will take 22,000 bales to the Black Sea port of Tuapse, having loaded 7,000 at Adelaide. On her first visit to Aus tralia, the Dolmatov carried a cargo of phos phate from Christmas Island to Geelong on a "party charter." Arising out of a dispute at Fremantle over alleged unsafe working gear, which had been passed by the surveyors,' Waterside Workers' Fremantle Branch Secretary Gordon Harris will write to the President of the Soviet Sea and River Workers' Union, whom he met in the Soviet Union, setting out the union's views. The Dolmatova has five women in the crew, including the ship's doctor.
