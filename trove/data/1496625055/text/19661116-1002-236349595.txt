 I Buck in for the home run J By June Mills j Hello, everybody. It's good to be back on the 1 job in time to help in the important job of over- I filling our fund target. | There will be five more issues of Tribune before Christmas and to reach our target of $3,000 we must average $26 each week. This is a small amount but we must take into con sideration that around this I time of the year there is plenty to do with the fami ly funds. So how about readers making a special end-of-the-year donation to Tribune Fund? If all our good support ers will do this we should be able to chalk up a good total for 1966.
