 POLAND'S GOLDEN VOICE gxjLPJNJGY: Australian audiences were "most attentive", Polish soprano Stefania Woy towicz, whose Australian re citals and orchestra concert performances will end in Syd ney this week, said at a recep tion at the Polish Consulate last Friday. People she had met after performances had shown great interest in Polish musical de velopments, she said. She also praised the centralisation of visiting artists' tours in the hands of the Australian Broad casting Commission. "This is a good example to Poland," she said, "where we have several agencies in this field." Miss Woytowicz is a singer or rare gifts. Her voice is round and full, and she has the nat ural ability to suffuse her per formance with all the warmth and intensity of a generous human nature, and inspire all who listen to her by her under standing and fine musical in telligence. 1 To hear the music of Polish , composer Szymanowski per formed by the Sydney Sym phony Orchestra and choir under a Swedish conductor with a Polish soprano soloist is an experience in the real spirit of international co-oper ation. Stefania Woytowicz and Swedish conductor Gunnar Staern will long be gratefully remembered by Sydney aud iences for their imaginative in troduction of works not pre viously heard from the Aus tralian concert platform. â€” H.
