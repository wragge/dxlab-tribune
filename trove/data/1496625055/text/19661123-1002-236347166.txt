 Phone - tap tinkers with civil rights ORISBANE: The Queensland Branch of the Australian Builders Labourers' Federation has condemned the Commonwealth Security Service for its spying activities against Mr. Francis James, managing director of the "Anglican" ana a JbiDerai Keiorm eauuiuaie. "The tapping of the telephones, the interception of mail, the "bugging" of citizens' homes and buildings is a violation of their personal rights," it said. "Since the activity of the Security Service is directed at trade unions and other working class organisations that stand in opposition to Government policy it is a violation of democratic rights of citizens. "We demand that the Federal Government end the political activities of the Security Service and legislate to guarantee the invoilability of citizens' mail and telephone and private conversations."
