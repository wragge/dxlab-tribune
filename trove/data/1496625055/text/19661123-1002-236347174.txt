 Leaders say tirn e 'ripe ' for world C.P. meeting From Rupert Lockwood kOSCOW: The General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Leonid Brezhnev, and Bulgarian Communist Partly First Sec retary Todor Zhivkov made important references at the Bulgarian Party Congress in Sofia to the calling of ah international Communist conference. "The Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee" said Zhivkov in the main Congress report, "holds that the conditions are ripe for the holding of an international conference of Communist and Workers Parties". Brezhnev, leader of the CPSU fraternal delegation to the Bulgarian Party Congress said, after references to the Vietnam crisis and criticisms of the Chinese attitude, that "the rallying of the working class of all countries and above all its vanguard— the international Communist movement — on the well-tested basis of Marxism-Leninism is one of our most important tasks today. "It is not without reason that a number of fraternal parties have of late been ex pressing the opinion that con ditions are increasingly mat uring for the convocation of another international meeting of Communist and Workers Parties. "We are fully convinced that the /unity of the inter national Communist move ment, the cohesion of its militant detachments will steadily grow and strengthen." While stressing the increas ing aid rendered by socialist countries to Vietnam, Brezh nev said that "one cannot hush up the role which leader ship of the Communist Party of China plays in this great cause which is close to the heart of every Communist. "We are grievously pained to note that all efforts by fraternal Parties to achieve unity of action with China, if only on this important question, meet with a categor ical refusal of the Chinese leadership. "lye are firmly convinced that the present difficulties will be overcome and the Chinese people, their Com munist Party, will again take their place in the united ranks of the socialist com munity and the world Com munist movement".
