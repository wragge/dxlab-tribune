 For November 26 On November 26 will you think of your son? or your grandson ? When you exercise your right to vote will you consider his right to live? Or will you condemn him ? Think carefully now. Do you want that mouth which once xuorc cake crumbs to wear the txuist of death knowing that to this your vote contributed? Do you want those eyes which shone with pride as he brought his first pay packet home to change to an unseeing stare which will still see you? Do you want the mud of football field that you have seen upon his face replaced with the blood of battle field that can be traced directly to your hand? Will you allow the polling booth to be a place where execution's planned and your ballot paper used as the instrument of this? Think carefully then. Perhaps to you no sons or grandsons have been born. But xvould you condemn to death other sons whom others mourn? Alan Miller
