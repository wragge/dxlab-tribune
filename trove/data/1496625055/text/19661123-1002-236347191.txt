 . . . CHARTER OF AGED'S NEEDS "J"HE needs of pension ers are clearly set out in a pamphlet "A Char ter of Pensioners Claims", issued by the Australian Commonwealth Pension ers' Federation. The inadequacy of the old- age pension is well-known, as also are the attempts made by pensioners' organisations to have the rate increased to not less than 50 per cent of Federal male basic wage. Increased rates have also been demanded for other pen sioners â€” civilian widows and invalid pensioners. Perhaps not so well-known as the hardship springing from the dire poverty of those dependent solely on pensions, is the suffering caused by lack of decent housing. The Federation said several years ago that "the Common wealth Government should make special grants each year to State Housing Authorities for the purposes of construc ting more self-contained single and double units for social service pensioners." Some units have been con structed, but not nearly enough to cope with the needs and the money advanced to State governments is not nearly enough to cope with the requirements. Abolition of the Means Test is an urgent demand of pen sioners' organisations. To 1 earn how pensioners live, their needs and what to do about them, read "A Char ter of Pensioners Claims".
