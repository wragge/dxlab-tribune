 FOOT IN KISSER ON HOME OWNERSHIP Letters Editor - - - r: ' MR Holt certainly put his foot in his mouth when he recently boasted that "over 50' per cent of Australians either own or are paying off their own homes, the highest percentage of any country in the world" (capitalist world, of course) . Fancy comparing Australia's midget population to the United States, Canada, Brit ain, South America, Africa France, Germany, etc., — where over 50 per cent of the people pay rent to landlords of the private enterprise variety. Right here in Australia, if the land was equitably dis tributed to the people, its rightful owners, every person would own several square miles. The fact that nearly half the population of Australia has to pay rent to landlords for their place of residence is damning indictment against the mirage of capitalist demo cratic prosperity. Hungry landlords, . , who are building thousands of com munal blocks of flats in the cities of Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth, knowing it is impossible under capitalism for every body to ' own their own homes. 4 It is pitiful to see teenage couples and others viewing these so-called luxury flats with $20 per week rentals and more unfurnished, plus power and light costs in addition. Capitalism can never boast of prosperity while any of its citizens pay rent equal to over 50 per cent of an aver age worker's wage. In the Soviet Union every citizen is entitled to a home free from landlord exploitat ion — rent is fixed at five per cent of a worker's , earning capacity. What a lovely feel ing it must be, to know the fruit of your labour is not being handed over every week to a landlord "Scrooge". Exploitation of man by man is the same in Sydney, Rome Vienna or wherever man hires his labour power, for the private profit of others. Mr. Holt knows this when he offers prospective soldiers for Vietnam $6000 as fighting enticement at 45 per cent per annum. Sid Cushing, Melbourne.
