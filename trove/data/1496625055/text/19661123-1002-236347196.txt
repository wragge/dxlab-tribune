 Stolen land "DEFERRING to the letter "Aborigines Overstress- ed" (Tribune, October 26), while admitting that South Australian industrial griev- ances should be aired, I must point out that the Northern Territory strike is of im mense concern not only to all Aborigines but all pastoral workers. It is to be hoped that Labor wins the Federal elections, but the elections will be past history shortly. When will the- Aborigines and all pastoral workers receive justice? Not till the whole trade union movement demands it. Obviously M. Edmonds who wrote the letter referred to, knows little of conditions of the outback (along with the rest of us). Australian stock men work longer hours under worse conditions for le.ss pay than any other group in Aus tralia. And these are the white stockmen I'm speaking , of. Conditions for the Aborigin al stockmen are beyond de scription. In commending Tribune for taking up the Aborigines cause I remind you that we are living in a stolen land, enjoying stolen wealth. As for the victims of the theft what compensation do we give them? Only enslavement, degradation or death! I suggest that a committee be set up— perhaps with UN backing — to conduct an in vestigation into, and put on permanent record, the atro cities that have been com mitted against the indigenous Australians. We trust that no longer are the stockmen hashed or their women raped— are we sure? M. Perry, Andamooka (S.A.)
