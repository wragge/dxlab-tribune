 4 more fined as loiterers' ADELAIDE: The last four young people out of a group of eight hunger strikers, faced charges of Loitering under the Lotteries and Gaming Act, last Wednesday. The charges arose when the Liberal President of the Legis lative Council issued instruc tions to the police to have them removed from the steps of Parliament House. They chose Parliament House steps to make their protest on Presi dent Johnson's visit and on US and Australian involvement in Vietnam. There was no opposition from the Government, police department, or the City Council who were advised by the group leader, Mr. D. Shaw, of their intentions to hold the hunger strike. However, when, in the even ing of the first day i.t was noticed that banners had been attached to the pillars, then he (Mr. Riches) considered this undesirable and had ap proached the President of the Legislative Council. They both agreed to make a request to have the banners removed. This was not complied to by the protestors so they were arrested after a complaint was laid by the Liberal . president. This action was supported by the Speaker, Mr. Riches, Labor member for Stuart. All four pleaded not guilty to the charges because they sincerely believed- their reasons were justifiable and supported by c majority of the people. They were fined $2.50.
