 Big business j a poised for gas I pipeline move | \ jDEL AIDE : New moves were mooted last week j to cash in on the failure of the Federal Gov- j ernment to guarantee special finance or loan money for South Australia's natural gas pipeline. The chairman of the Bank of Adelaide, Sir Arthur Rymill, stated that private enterprise should be called in when he addressed the Banks share holders at their annual meet ing. Sir Arthur Rymill is, as well as being director of several other big companies, also a Liberal member of the Cham ber of property and privilege, the Legislative Council. The Council last week took steps to prevent the Succession Duties Bill being passed which would have helped relieve the State Government's financial position at the expense of the wealthy. Interest The Bank's chairman showed the real purpose of the prop osal when he stated that in terest rates on capital employed would be higher if private en terprise were to finance the pipeline. Sir Arthur sugar-coated the pill by claiming that this would be offset by getting an earlier start on the project. If his "public mindedness" j is not to be misconstructed as j an attempt to take advantage ! of the hold-up by his Federal J counterparts in order to make j profit, he should float an in- terest free loan among his j associates and business inter- j ests immediately, observers g commented last week. f It wold be interesting to note j Sir Arthur's contribution at j the head of the list, they said.
