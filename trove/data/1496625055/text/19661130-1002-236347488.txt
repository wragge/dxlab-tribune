 CALLING MRS JONES: Wave your flag at W'mooloo / IT landed last Wednesday, quietly and without fuss — 200 I cases (about three tons) of imported margarine. After all the ballyhoo about hapless housewife Mrs. Jones — topped by the sackings of Australian margarine workers — bydney wharties and tally clerks looked at the shipment some what cynically as it came off the cargo ship Poona at No, 3 Woolloomooloo. They were wondering just how much imported margarine was being allowed into this country? The State Liberal Government seems so "concerned" about margarine quotas that it is prepared to let hundreds of workers be dismissed by Marrickville Margarine Ltd. Last week Tribune stated that margarine quotas were only being used as a screen behind which the Government and the big margarine monopoly Allied Mills were hiding. This company already controls over 50 per cent of Australian margarine production and will no. doubt also swallow up Marrickville Margarine if this company is forced out of business. s . ' Last week in Sydney a meeting of 10 unions covering margarine workers decided to conduct a campaign to protect the jobs of workers in this industry. NSW Labor Council organiser, Mr. J. Ducker, said the meeting condemned the State Government for its disregard of the welfare of thousands of margarine workers. Lunch-time meetings will be held to discuss the possibility of a strike throughout the industry. Mr. Ducker said the unions accused the Askin Government of allowing itself to be pres surised by the Country Party and monopoly. "Askin is also denying the right of freedom of choice to Australian housewives, he said. The unions1 have demanded: The ending of monopoly control of the industry. The safeguarding of wor kers' jobs. The lifting of margarine quotas. SAME-DAY SYDNEY PAPER BANNERS Arthur or Martha?
