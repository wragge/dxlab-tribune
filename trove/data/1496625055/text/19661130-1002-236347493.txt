 FRANCO'S 3-CARD TRICK O N D O N: General Franco's whitewashers are trying to persuade people that the Spanish dictator is making noves towards a. democracy by ap pointing a Prime Minister and ordering a referendum on a "new constitution". He .is doing nothing of the kind. The new Prime Minister will be a fascist, picked by Franco, presiding over a fascist Cortes and running a fascist police state. An "amnesty" has been an nounced for "political of fences" during the civil war, but the military law under which Julian Grimau, Com munist patriot, was recently framed and executted, still stands. Franco's announced changes in the structure of fascism leave the fascist Falange So the only legal party, 16,000 political prisoners still in jail and the independent trade union movement still under ground. Changes for the better in Spain won't be brought about by the murderers of its liber ties, as the Morning star says. The Star shows that. the real hope for the future lies in the underground trade union opposition which won sen sational victories in recent elections in the fascist con trolled syndicates. Although illegal, this op position was too strong not to be recognised and its can didates frequently defeated the fascist condidates. Thus in Madrid's Standard engineering plant the 14,000 workers elected 152 delegates, every one of whom was a "Workers' Commission" op position candidate.
