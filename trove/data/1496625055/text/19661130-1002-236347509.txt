 FOLLOWING IN BILL WHITE'S STEPS I CYDNEY: Simon I Townsend a I young journalist and I conscientious objec- tor recently staged a one man demonstra tion against being called up for an army medical examination. On November 11 he stood outside Grace Build ing in Sydney wearing a sign "I am defying con scription, I refuse a med ical examination here to night." AS young conscripts en tered Grace Building for their medical examination, . Simon handed them a letter explaining . why he was making the protest. His application to be registered as a conscien-' tious objector was refused by Mr. C. S. Rogers, S.M. as was his appeal to Judge Curlewis in the District Court. One day when out walk ing , he bought a copy of The Australian and saw the headline "Conscripts Sure to be in Vietnam Next Year". He had not walked another 20 yards before conscription and the war in Vietnam became the one, and he then made up his mind ,he wasn't going. Simon began to read a great deal of pacifist liter- .ature' and became a firm conscientious objector â€” in fact the (leader of a Sydney group of 60 con scientious objectors. (Bill White, recently inducted into the army, adopted a policy of pas sive resistance.) I "I am refusing to have an army medical examin ation, and if they take me I will passively resist like Bill White. At all times I will try to act with the same dignity and will, re fuse all army orders and requests," he said. SIMON TOWNSEND.
