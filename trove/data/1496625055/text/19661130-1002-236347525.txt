 11,1 1 Was the Big Cat j in with a fox ? % By the Challenger f JINCE Cassius Clay's deft handling of "The Big Cat" (Cleve- i land Williams) in the Houston Astrodome a few weeks ago,/ spasmodic reports seem to indicate that his next opponent will be Ernie Terrell (in February), the holder of the World Boxing | Association's version of the heavyweight title. 5 Clay has now defended his title seven times, six in the last twelve months. While it may appear, judging from this record, that Clay is endeavouring to emulate the deeds of the great Joe Louis, who beat so many opponents so often that sports writ ers tagged the episodes "the bum of the month", many of the fistic fraterni ty will no doubt giye Ter- Irell a real chance of beat ing him. This conclusion stems from an illustrated report in Ring Magazine this year, of Terrell out-jab bing and repeatedly beat ing Cassius to the punch, in a gym spar. However, gym spars have on numerous occa sions in the past proved, to be a very bad basis on which to judge the out come of a bout, as some fighters just can't force themselves to their best under the conditions. Also, since Cassius seems to want to fight' Terrell next, it is some in dication that he's confi dent of winning. In any case, the publicity boys will beat the drums of Li ballyhoo and develop all | > the angles. f Cassius, the punching | poet can be relied upon $ help in the publicity dep- | artment and will probably ' explain the situation thus: 1 "Terrell in the gym thinks i. he taught the 'Lip' to > box, ji But maybe he'll find he 1 was in with a fox. jf And in February when it's | not for fun Â£ He'll realize he's just the next bum.
