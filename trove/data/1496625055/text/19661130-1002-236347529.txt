 1 New support for White The Association for Cultural Freedom management com mittee has issued a statement that it shares in "the wide- spread public disquiet that there may have been a mis carriage of justice in the re fusal of the courts to classify William White as a con scientious objector who should be totally exempt from military service. "We recommend that the National Service Act be amend ed so that decision on applic ation for exemption on grounds of conscientious objection be made by juries rather than by a magistrate or a judge. We believe that juries are better able than magistrates or judges to assess conscience in a way that is both enlightened and likely to carry public support.
