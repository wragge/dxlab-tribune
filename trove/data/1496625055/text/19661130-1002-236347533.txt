 Victoria Labor's stand vindicated TMIELBOURNE: Although the swing to the Government was reflected in Victoria as ir the other states — with the exception of Western Australia — the Labor Party as; we go to press appears to have lost no seats and Liberal Party gained none. This has special significance in view of the fact that Vic toria is the home state of Opposition Leader Calwell and the leader of the ALP's left- wing, Dr. Cairns. Those who wish to attribute the Labor reverse to the in fluence of these leaders and to the Victorian Executive of the ALP can find little com fort in the actual results of Victorian voting. The Labor Party waged a good campaign in Victoria, with few electorates where ALP activity was not at a high level. In view' of all political cir cumstances — the ALP stand on conscription and the strong , support for. this policy by the Victorian organisation — the vote for Labor, though reduced, was more significant than a much higher Labor vote would have been under different conditions. Liberal Reform Candidates polled well in some elector ates, recording some returns of 4-5000. However, the fact that the swing was to the Government robbed their role of immediate electoral signif icance. Taken together, the Labor, Communist and Liberal Re form-candidates, ...aU._.Atanding. on a policy of strong oppos ition to the Vietnam war and ' conscription, polled almost 40 per Scent of the formal . vote. Such a vote indicates the broad base on which Vic torian opponents of Holt's war policy can build in the future.
