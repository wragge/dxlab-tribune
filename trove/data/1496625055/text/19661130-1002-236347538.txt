 i— — — — a— —— South Australia Reflects State questions ADELAIDE: The reduction by about 12 per cent of the Labor Party's share of votes in South Australia, leading to the loss of three Labor seats, will give the Liberals eight out of the eleven in the House of Representatives from this State. In addition to factors caus- ing the national swmg, the result in S.A. is undoubtedly due to . opposition , generated against the State Labor Gov ernment. In South Australia the level of unemployment is the high est in the Commonwealth, there are problems of the State's deficit and the Government is under fire in a number of quarters Some of this criticism of the Government is deserved, but it mainly arises from the failure of the Federal Gov ernment to face up to finan cial responsibilities', from the obstruction of the conservat ive Legislative Council and the constant hostile campaign ing of the press. Besides the loss of King- ston, Adelaide and Grey, there were big. swings against Labor Members in seats usually re garded as impregnable. In Hindmarsh and Bonython the votes of C. Cameron and M. Nicholls respectively de clined by 20% and they will win by only small margins. In Port Adelaide, the Labor vote fell by 18 per cent and the vote of Communist can didate Jim Moss also declined.
