 20 bucks from! Tharaomindah i By June Mills | | INTIL last Thursday Thargomindah was just a J nice-sounding name to me. But then I re- j ceived as a telegram from Bill Ebenhardt "Wiring j $20 Sydney". This was such a pleas ant surprise that I took the trouble to find out that Thargomindah is via Cun- namulla, hundreds of miles west of Brisbane. Thanks a lot, Bill. Another donation from Queensland — from Mt. Isa readers — is also a wel- i come sign of response to j our appeal for a Christ- : mas donation to Tribune Fund. As > the $3000 target is now within easy reach, the big question is — how ! much bonus to Tribune, i over and. above the target, j can readers give? j Three more issues of the j paper before the end of > the year and before i.t be- j comes the national Tribune j so let's have a record, re sponse for the next three weeks. Watch the little man belt that gong right j up over the target! j This week: | STUC $1.50, Dom. F.P. per F. O. $1, Dom gate | $1.50, Eddy Ave. 50c, Mt. j Isa readers $2, W.
