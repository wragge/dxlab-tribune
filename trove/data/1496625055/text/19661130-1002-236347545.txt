 NEW BONN I — aaMMi.i' .. iiiiiwmw G.D.R. POLICY? If the West Ger man social demo crats move into a coalition with the Christian Democrats, I the next question is whether they will j maintain their re- cently-adopted stand in favor of a more sensible approach to the German Demo- I cratic Republic. I US Time magazine com- I mented earlier: E £ "Whatever the final outcome it seemed likely that West Germany's next Government would rudely revise most of Bonn's most holy foreign f policy tenets. "For years Bonn has f stood unbendingly for no J official contact with East | | Germany, no diplom- i 1 atic relations with any I | 1 country that recognised 1 | I East Germany, no detente I | j with the Soviet bloc un- J | j til after Germany achiev- j f I ed reunification. Demands I 1 . I "As a price for particip- j ating in any coalition the j | Socialists last week issued | a set of demands in cluding the establishment | of diplomatic relations ftj with East bloc nations, all- fij out efforts for a detente with the USSR with no | prior conditions and im- ! mediate economic grants to East Germany. "Next day the Free Democrats came out with o foreign policy statement K that echoed the socialist | stand. Even Christian | Democrats were gingerly || deserting some of the old If doctrines". | Even the new ex-Nazi j | CDP leader, Kiesinger i lately called for good re- i lations with the East and | Franz Joseph Strauss also 1 I made a statement open- f ing the way for a more conciliatory policy towards | | the East ,says Time.
