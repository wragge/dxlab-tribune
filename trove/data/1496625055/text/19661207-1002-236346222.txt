 COOL THOUSAND FOR TRIB I Approximately $1000 — marking an increase over last year's I figure — was the final tally raised for Tribune by last | weekend's very successful Tribune Fair, held in the Jim I Healy Memorial Hall in Sydney. Chief highlights included the Jewellery Stall, at which an attractive range of rings and necklaces, etc., beautifully made | from Australian semi-precious stones met with a heavy | demand, and the hats and softgoods stand (see above) which I took over $100. The Fair Committee wishes to extend its deepest thanks to the dozens of people who so generously donated their time, goods and hard work to make the Fair such a success. It would appreciate any suggestions to improve the organ isation and appeal of future Fairs. The Committee's final meeting will be held on Tuesday, December 13 at 8 p.m. at 168 Day St., Sydney and all those interested are cordially invited to attend.
