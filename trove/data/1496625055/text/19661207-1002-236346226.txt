 Bonanza! And now for the bonus... By June Mills TERRIFIC news this week! We've topped the $3,000 target — by almost $70 — and looks like moving on to even bigger and better things before the vear is out. In particular we must thank Jack Dye of Kogarah Hotel stand who gave Tribune a Christmas gift of $52. I've told readers before now about Jack, but because of his untiring work for the paper I think it worth while to repeat it. He is 84 years of age and sells Tribune each week at Kogarah Hotel. This surely must be one of the main records of devotion to our cause. Another Xmas gift of $20 comes from our friend Wobbly who in the past also has given many donations. Also pleasing is the receipt of $4 from Darwin readers and $2 from Nambour, Queensland. The more donations to the Fund from places outside Sydney, the better the basis for Tribune to become a truly national paper (from January 10). Still the question remains- how much bonus to Tribune, over and above the target, can readers give in the next two weeks? This week: F.F. per F.O. $2, STUC 10c, Dom. per F.O. 40c, Kings X donors 65c, Oxford St. sellers per Bill Fitzpatrick 55c, J.H. Georges Hall 50c, Darwin readers $4, "Wobbly."
