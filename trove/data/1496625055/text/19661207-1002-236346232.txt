 6th Fleet poised to prop up puppet king THE Soviet paper Pravda warns that the American Sixth Fleet is ready to intervene in tne middle east, partic ularly against Syrian and Jordanian patriots. Reports of threats to land US marines in co-operation with Israel in an attempt to juniuenue events m oyna turn Jordan coincide with the movement of the Sixth Fleet to Istanbul. The US threat follows pop ular demonstrations in Jordan against the feudal dictator ship of King Hussein, whom the people accuse of collusion with the Israel Government in last month's destruction of the Jordanian town of Samu. Hussein is also in leaque with King Feisal of Saudi Arabia, whose "Islamic League" is spear-headed against Syria and other pro gressive Arab states. Hussein has banned the Communist Party and other democratic organisations in Jordan. Prompt H,is Arab Legion, which somehow wasn't on the spot to fight the Israeli forces at Samu, was very prompt in acting against the anti-Hus sein demonstrators. Last week it was announced that the US had agreed to 11 1 sell WaiJJialJ.es uuuii ou Hussein and Israel â€” which takes some of the sting out of US support of the UN cen sure motion on Israel over the Samu invasion. On the same day the sale to Israel was announced, the Israeli forces claimed to have shot down two United Arab Republic planes. After Vietnam and Dominica the US has been asserting its "right" to intervene with force in any part of the world where events don't suit its in terests. The Middle East would be no exception. Tending to restrain it is the serious warning by the USSR , to Israel not to invade Syria, the new Syria-UAR military alliance and the friendship of both Syria and the UAR with the USSR. UAR Vice-President Mar shal Abdel Hakim Amer has just returned to Cairo after a series of talks in Moscow with Sovier Premier Kosy- gin.
