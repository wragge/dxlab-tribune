 Disturbing play about us fUDAH WATEN'S LITERARY COMMENT IIS is the name of the sensational and dis turbing play on the Viet nam war which is currently playing in London at the Aldwych Theatre, a theatre subsidised by the Govern ment. It is directed by Peter Brook, one of the directors of the Royal Shakespeare Company, and the players are from that company, a group of very dedicated and versatile actors. The play is partly a document ary study of the war but its real purpose is to penetrate the de fences of the audience and bring the barbarities of the war into the theatre. My sister who wrote to me from London shortly after she had seen the play thought it was a great protest. The first part consists of documentary material (acted out in styles from Chinese symbolism- to television journal ism) interspersed with a series of accusing poems. "Tell Me Lies About Vietnam", by Adrian Mit chell. This part is presented on a scrapyard stage with a satanic carnival dummy of huge dimen- sions suspended above. This monster, smothered in American symbols with a yellow rocket in its belly and a coloured child perched in each of its eye sockets, is war itself. ? |N the November 10 issue of the Times Literary Supplement the reviewer of Professor J. D. Miller's ; new book, "Australia", takes him to task for fail ing to deal with the mass media. He says: "For its state of literacy and affluence Australia has a press which is among the worst in the world, and, in spite of the heroic efforts of the impecunious Aus tralian Broadcasting Commission to stand up to the competition of the powerful commercial sta tions, the worst radio and almost the worst television . . . "The state of the mass media in Australia . . . accounts for what is the most significant fact about the state of culture in Aus tralia as a whole, if not that of the tiny handful of intellectuals â€”namely the galloping pace of Americanisation."
