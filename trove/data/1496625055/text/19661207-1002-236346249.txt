 Man of peace QUIET! The consequences of this experiment may shake the world when this young scientist (or is it engineer?) really goes to work around 1986. At the moment his laboratory is the Australian Design Centre in Sydney. The picture was taken last week at an exhibition of Australian and imported con structive toys, presented by the Industrial Design Council. Emphasis is laid on the par ents' responsibility to choose toys that encourage and guide a child's desire to learn. . Everyday objects like tables, and chairs are twice their normal size to remind parents how a child sees things. The free exhibition will be open until January 20 on week days from 9 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. and on Saturdays from 9 a.m. I until noon. Mrs. Zara Splayford, NSW secretary of the Union of Aus tralian Women, commenting on the exhibition said, "this Christ mas, sharp contrast to last, there is more emphasis on con structive toys and less on war toys." One of the reasons for this, Mrs. Splayford said, was the campaigns waged against war toys by the UAW, Save Our Sons (SOS) and other organisa tions and people. "There is also a growing awareness among parents of the harmful effects realistic imita tions of machine guns, gas guns, grenades and other wai toys have Ion their children."
