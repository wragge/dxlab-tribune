 VIETNAM Rice to feed a thousand rebels, Bred by a bomb from the wrong plane , Grows in the glue-mud Thick as the liver's blood Of the sybaritic Major Back from the Saigon whores . The Hotspur of the paddy-fields , I Leading his men in fratricide, I For a paragraph in "Time". I Death in seven-league boots Tramps on the grapes of wrath, And transubstantiates The wine of village life, To the staccato chant of a B.AM. The Red film in their eyes, Leaves its negative on their souls, Squatting, like fallen angels, In the flickering light , Of the burning huts, They sec the blood of Cain , Jelly black in the mud. Silent in tunnels, the Viet Cong grow, tired' hv such deaths ns innocence knows. â€” "Roho"
