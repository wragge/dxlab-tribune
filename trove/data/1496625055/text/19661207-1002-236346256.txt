 SAVELOY AND A PINCH OF TEA FOR THE OLD Letters to the WEditori i:' >. I TOO, have known pensioners, who make the same kind of pur chases as those seen by Harry Roberts. I fol- lowed un elderly woman from one Post Office one pension day to a small-goods shop, and saw her buy ONE sav eloy and a lb of tea. I have known a woman who collected scrap newspaper as the one source of heating, fuel stove cooking; she in vested in an electric stove, H.F., but found that with the rising cost of living, she could not afford to cook meals more than a few times weekly. I knew another lass who opened her hand to show me how she separted her pension, the larger part being reserved for rent. "Doesn't leave me much to live on, does it?" she asked. I agreed. Now more and more pen sioners are realising the answer to the problem lies with themselves; and muddle we call our "social system" must he changed for one of justice. S. Bannister, Lawson, (NSW)
