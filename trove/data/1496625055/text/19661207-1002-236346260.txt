 US women jack-up JTAILY press reports on the nationwide revolt of Ame rican housewives against high food prices are emphasising gimmickry and bizarre sales promotion methods as the major causes of the rising prices. However, the real cause is undoubtedly the in flation heightened by the Viet nam war. Press reports this week ad mitted that food prices in the U.S. have been climbing at an annual rate of 3.5% as com pared with an average in crease of 1.3% in the previous five years, with basic food stuffs like bread and milk the hardest hit. This must have worsened the plight of the 17 million people who (according to the late President Kennedy) go to bed hungry every night. Obviously Presdient Johnson's declared War on Poverty has not yet got off the ground, whilst the undeclared war in Vietnam is being escalated and has two-thirds of the American economy geared to it. It seems certain that the housewives among the 17 mil lion would be playing a lead ing part in this splendid movement. And women every where will be gladdened by the way U.S. prices have started to tumble as an out come of the picketings of the supermarkets. Across the coun try grocery bills have come down â€” in the last two weeks of October, for instance, the price of butter fell 8 cents a pound. Press claims that it can't happen here because competi tive retailing in this country has kept prices keen are be lied by a statement by Mrs. .Edna Roper, M.L.C. that food prices in Australia have risen by 9% over the past two years. This week's moves by the Tasmanian State Government to introduce legislation con trolling prices, similar to ex isting legislation in South Australia, are another indica tion that prices in Australia are far too high. Undoubtedly the success of American housewives will spur Austra lian trade unions and the women's movement to new efforts to bring about nation wide price control in our count rv.
