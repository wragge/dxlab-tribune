 Peace Noel JV/TANY years ago (1947, I think) you published some "revised" Xmas hymns written by Paul Dehn, a Bri- tish poet. They were directed at those churchmen who sup ported atomic weapons. Some of these "hymns" may be considered "dated", in 1966, as the Church (in general) no longer supports the use of atomic weapons. In theory, anyway. But I send you a copy of one of them which is still VERY relevant — and which I hope you may use in your pre-Xmas issue. "The last Noel the Angel did «oy Was to certain poor people in fields os they lay; In fields where they lay to salve somebody's pride. "Noel!" said the Angel; and no-one replied." This is surely the logical outcome of American aims in Vietnam — a so-called Christ ian nation intent on exter minating the whole of the Vietnamese people, if neces sary, rather than "lose face" by retreating. "To salve some body's pride" indeed. B.J I, Sydney.
