 Veteran remembers QJINCE 1892 I have taken part in many campaigns to improve the status of the worker and to resist any en- croachment upon the civil liberties won at such bitter cost by our forebears, but never in any better conducted campaign than the 1916-1917 No Conscription fights. The NSW trade unions met and after a long and heated debate decided to set up a "No" all-in organisation. Soon we had central, suburban and country committees composed of men and women of differ ent callings and religious but as one in their determination to win out. Our headquarters in Mac- donnell House throbbed like a power house day and night, so eager were the people to give of their best. When y?e set aside things that divide us and unite for common good we demonstrate the truth of an old Welsh saying "the peo ple are mightier than the lords" be they war lords, rent lords or law lords. Old timers will remember the big meetings held in town and country, the unsuccessful attempts to disrupt, that wonderful scene of men and women marching four and six abreast behind banners with the name of their suburb to take part in the Newtown Bridge 1917 rally when fully 20,000 gave three cheers for a "No" victory. From start to finish I took part in both campaigns and I can truly say the common peo ple were magnificent, start ing from behind scratch, fac ed with hostile Parliaments, press and pulpit they held the torch of liberty alight in those dark days of World War I, the war to end wars.
