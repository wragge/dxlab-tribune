 1000 strike at dock YDNEY: Over 1,000 workers at Cockatoo Dock yard in Sydney went on. strike last Wednesday in protest against insufficient washing time and for improved amenities. The stoppage, the first gen eral walkout for over 14 years, was precipitated when the man. agement began docking wor kers for washing "early." The men say that the five minutes washing time does not allow all the workers to adequately wash in the facil ities available. Union delegates say that 236 men in the ship yard section are required, to wash in 50 basins and. few have time to use the 17 showers available. In the Boiler Shop 70 men have 25 basins and three showers and. a similar situation exists in other shops. The management, although it allows workers 10 minutes walk ing and. washing time, were docking workers if they began washing before the prescribed five minutes. A mass meetihg of the men last Monday ended the strike following a management assur ance that 38 apprentices would not be victimised, for joining the strike.
