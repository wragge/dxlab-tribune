 Concrete drivers' strike I Hard to cool off when you're treated like dogs CYDNEY: Last week's strike by Ready Mixed Concrete drivers ended 1 following an order by the NSW Industrial Commission for a month's i cooling off pending the settlement of the dispute. I A week-long strike followed the Concrete Manufacturers As sociation's attack on the rights of lorry owner-drivers to be members of and represented by the Transport Workers' Union. Some 400 owner-drivers and 400 company-employed drivers took joint action to defend this right. Mr. Dick Clarling, assistant 1 secretary of the TWU, gave 1 Tribune some reasons why the 1 owner-drivers are union men: 9 "Up until October, 1960 they S were treated like dogs and only | got from 8/6 to 9/6 a yard for I carrying concrete. 9 "They had no guaranteed 1 minimum load and could sit 9 around for hours without get- 9 ting work. 9 "They didn't receive overtime 9 rates for Saturdays, Sundays or 9 public holidays. 9 "This situation was changed 9 following the first agreement 9 the TWU obtained to cover. 9 these men on October 30, 1960." t 9 He said the employers want 9 the owner-drivers to have their 9 own association which would 9 have little industrial strength 9 or authority to make agree- 9 ments. 9 In their desire to bring back 9 the old "dog eat dog" condi- 9 tions, the employers precipitat- 9 ed a dispute which was bring- 9 ing the whole building industry 9 to a standstill. 9 Hundreds of building work- 9 era had been stood down and 9 thousands of others were 9 threatened. 9 The building unions then 9 demanded an immediate con- 9 ierence with the Employers' 9 Federation to instruct the Con- fl crete Manufacturers to recog- fl nise the right of the TWU to 9 represent lorry -owner drivers. fl Mass meetings of building fl workers on some city jobs also H demanded that their employers fl advise the Employers' Federa- fl tion that they oppose the ac- fl tions of the Concrete Manufac- fl turers. fl
