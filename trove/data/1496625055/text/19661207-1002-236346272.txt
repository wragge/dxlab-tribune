 VOTE CONFIRMS C.P. VIEW, SA YS AARONS gYDNEY : The Federal election had already confirmed some of the content of the draft documents issued last week in preparation for the 23rd national congress next year of the Communist Party of Australia. The party's general secretary (Mr. L. Aarons) gave this view in opening a press conference at the party's headquarters in Syd ney last Friday. "Very big changes are occur ring in the Australian political situation and they crystallised in the elections", he said. The draft documents (pre pared before the elections), made a deeper analysis than had been done by the party for some time of the techno logical changes and their ef fects, the ideological trends and the alignments in modern Aus tralian society. Earlier in the week, at a crowded meeting of some 250 people in the city, Mr. Aarons had said that the election re sult was at once a setback for the labor movement, a warn ing and a challenge to all who I were concerned about Austra lia's future. H,e also took part in a half- hour "newsmakers" radio ses sion on 2GB Sydney. Mr. Aarons told the press conference that the aim in is suing the documents much ear lier than had normally been the case before a national con gress was to secure thorough clarifying discussion inside the party and extending beyond its membership. "We want it to stimulate communists of all trends of opinion, including those op posed to present aspects of pol icy, to present and to think over their views", he said. "We also hope to stimulate discussion in the left grouping as a whole, including the trade union movement, radical trends and the left forces in the Labor Party. "We are sure there will be contrary opinions inside the party and certainly outside." The discussion would be fully reflected through a special jour nal, first issue of which would be published on January 31. Some of the press and radio correspondents' questions at the conference, and the answers, are given below. MR. L. AARONS
