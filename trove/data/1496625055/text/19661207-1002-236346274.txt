 Correction In the article on 25 years of the Eureka Youth League, published last week, a quotation from historical notes by Audrey Blake on the attitude of the EYL to parties in the 1949 Federal election read: "This amplified what is a very complex and central question of the Australian Labor Movement". The word "amplified" was an error of publication, and should have read "simpli fied". Printed and published at 21 Ross St., Forest Lodoe, by D. B. Young Pty. limited, of 168 Day t., Sydney.
