 Burning pretty dim JpUTURE generations will pay John Steinbeck due homage for works like "Grapes of Wrath" and "Of Mice and Men", but they are lixeiy to wonder if his play "Burning Bright", which opened last week at Sydney's Ensemble Theatre, was written by the same man. Couched in a pretentiously simple prose poetry, it deals with a wife's attempt to answer her sterile husband's longing for a child by— unbeknown to hum- using another man to father it. Steinbeck apparently wants to show through this rather peculiar device the oneness of mankind and the importance of the continuity of the human race, emphasised by his placing the action of the play in three different settings— a cir cus, a farm and a ship — while using the same four characters throughout. Director Hayes 1 Gordon has worked wonders in the past, but even his magic fails with this melodramatic and stilted piece. Nor is he helped overmuch by the cast. Experienced Owen Wein- gott is generally convincing and moving as the cuckold husband, except for the farm scene when he becomes almost embarrassingly clod-hopperish, and Lorrae Des mond is mostly adequately sweet as the well-meaning though some what unorthodox wife. But James Scullin as the hus band's close mate Friend Ed seems overawed by the purple prose and delivers most of his lines in a monotonous whine, while Ken Shorter has neither the vocal com mand nor general bearing for the part of the stud stallion. — R.M.
