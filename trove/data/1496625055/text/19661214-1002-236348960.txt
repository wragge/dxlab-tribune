 CHINESE I SOLID, TOO 0N. a table in the I hot pokey mess- room was a sheet torn from a big color- ful calendar. It was turned . face down and crew member's crowd ed around, each penning his name. Then, when all had signed, up went a delegation with the sheet . to the captain. But then some other crew member turned up. He wanted to have his name there, too. So down the companionway again came the delegation to get the missing name. Only then did it go up to the captain. That was how the Chin ese crew of the Dutch ship Tjinegarra, berthed at Dalgetys in Brisbane last week, proclaimed the fact that they were on strike. POLICE They went on strike after the captain of the Tjinegarra's sister ship, the Straat Malakka, had shot four of its Chinese crew members. ' After the. shooting, crew members from the Tjine garra — at the next berth to the Straat Malakka— pour ed along the wharf, but were blocked by massed police. On the Wednesday morn ing, Brisbane union offi cials met the crew aboard the Tjinegarra. When Tjinegarra crew members were told in the messroom that the T&LC had declared the two sister ships "black," a jubilant cheer went up.
