 Plea for BBBBBSBBSBSBBflnm unity rpHE present developments within the Chinese Com munist leadership cause alarm to us Australian Communists, as no doubt to tnose eise where in the world. We too are doing our utmost to bring about a reversal to the pre sent Australian commitment in Vietnam. The suffering of the Viet namese and their bravery makes us feel that we are bound to do our utmost to bring about as speedily as possible the humane ending that they and progressive humanity desire. Their noble stand wins our hearts and our applause. The present fratricide of the C.P.C. leadership is dam aging to all that true Com munists stand for. Their stand against the Declaration of 81 Communist parties and espe cially the C.P.S.U. makes me condemn their present policy since it harms our endeavours for the Australian withdrawal of armed personnel in Viet nam as well as our aim to draw all progressive Austra lians, especially the Austra lian workers to the building a noble Socialist Australia. Unity in the communist ranks and the application of marxism-leninism in reality will bring the death knell to imperialism and the building of a humane socialist world. The ending of personal glorification of leaders in the People's Republic of China and of the present Chinese in terpretation of marxism-lenin ism would bring again the respect of all Communist and progressive peoples, instead of it bringing, at present, grist to the imperialist propaganda mill. It is this that aids and abets the U.S. imperialists and al lies in their murderous and aggressive violation of the Vietnamese nation. Brother hood and internationalism is the key to understanding and the settlement of differences. J. Morris, Collaroy, N.S.W.
