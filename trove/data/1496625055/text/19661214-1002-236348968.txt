 What they did in the war T GAINED some very strong impressions from a visit to the Soviet Union, in Sep tember and October this year. Keeping in mind the devas tation of the last war, I saw for myself that the courage of the people, their willing ness to work, young and old, the love they have for their country and the achievements they have made are really re markable. The positive attitude of the people for peace and the ex ample which is shown to their children impressed me very much. I considered it an honour and found it very moving to be able to lay flowers at the Leningrad memorial cemetery, knowing that in the mass graves there lie 470,000 people, who courageously gave their lives for their country. My two brothers were killed in action in the battle for Britain at the same time in 1942. What a dreadful year that must have been! I visited the war memorial in London containing my bro thers' names and a total 20,455 names of missing airmen that have no known graves. My experience will help strengthen me in my work with others for peace and I sincerely believe that social ism is the only answer for the future of mankind. Isabel Mc Arthur, (Tighes Hill, NSW).
