 Dig deeper into socialism mnrwmn-mn m minium i iiiniimiiriwwiTiiiniTW«m fpHE article on 50 years of the USSR (Tribune, Nov ember 23), is good but to my mind not any different in real content from a whole series of articles over more years than I can remember. It does not give any indication of the tremendous struggle that is going on in the Soviet Union to make the productive forces work for the benefit of man and the various ideas, young and old have on this process. There is no doubt that the Soviet Union is advancing, and rapidly, but we also want to know what are the prob lems of socialism, why some people become stubborn and lose interest in production, why drunkenness is a prob lem with some young people, what are the problems of working women — and there are problems — why is the birthrate so low in the west ern part etc. — as well as their great achievements. If people are told that every thing is progressing well and smoothly and then hear dif ferently, they become disil lusioned. It is more than ever necessary to give both sides.
