 He heard Nazi speak jyjELBOURNE: A Melbourne man who, a few weeks ago, sat in a German beerhall where Hitler once spoke and heard the speakers at a meet- ing of the neo-nazi National Democratic Party told the Tribune this week of his im pressions- He is Mr. Ernest Platz, jour nalist; and Labor member of the Fitzroy Council. Mr. Platz said that NDP leader Herr Von Thadden told a mixed audience of 4000 at the meeting: "Once everybody spat in our faces. Now they need us." Von Thadden called for the expulsion of most of the mil lion and a half foreign workers now in West Germany, and demanded that German troops be placed under German com mand. He also called for the re lease of all war criminals a-nd every man convicted for "do ing his duty during the war." Mr. Platz, himself a former inmate of 'Buchenwald con centration camp, told "Tribune how glad he was to see young people heckling Von Thadden in Nuremberg. "They carried placards which said 'We don't want nazism back' and 'Go back to your holes'." Opposition However, according to Mr. Platz, only about a quarter of the audience were in opposi tion toN Von Thadden, who pointed to the hecklers, saying "Look at them, products of re education". Mr. Platz met many middle- of-the-road political leaders in West Germany. He said they "were genuinely disturbed" at the success of the rightwing ul tra nationalists, but regarded fears of a. nazi revival as "ex aggerated". Mr. Platz asked them why the German constitution was not geared to put a stop to blatant nazi propaganda. "After all," he said, "you found ways and means of out lawing the Communist Party."
