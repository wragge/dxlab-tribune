Katharine Susannah Prichard may not like being t treated as the doyen of literature. After all she 'has not retired, frojn writing or from social-political activity.

Katharine Susannah Prichard always considered, that the fight for peace, the.' . fight against facism, was a necessary condition for the very contin uation of culture and. liter ature. Champion Since the end of the war she has worked hard and long to prevent war and fascism happening again, and she has been a great cham pion of friendly relations with the Soviet Union.

Katharine Susannah Prich ard 's literary life covers a period, of 60 odd. years. Her first novel, "The Pioneers", won Â£1000 in an Empire-wide competition then a tremen dous achievement for an Aus tralian writer. With Henry Handel Richard son and Vance Palmer, she pioneered the realist Austra lian novel, helping to liberate the Australian novel from mid-Victorian conventions and the aggressive, sometimes, chauvinistic, Australianism and. obsessions with dialect that were characteristic of the earlier novels. At an early age Katharine Susannah Prichard chose her path. She could have lived a purely literary life that might have seemed quite idyllic. It was, among all her other merits, her particular merit that she knew it could be I nothing of the sort. Katharine Susannah Prichard
