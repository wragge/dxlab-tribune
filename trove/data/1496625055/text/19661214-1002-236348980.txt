 POLL SHOWS NEED FOR P.R. By a Political Correspondent "HE final result of counting in the Federal election has again revealed the shortcomings of the voting system and raised the need for introduction of the proportional representation system. Under proportional represent ation, seats would be allocated in proportion to the total num ber of votes cast nationally for the various parties. It is regard ed as the most democratic sys tem as it ensures direct repre sentation for minorities. In the recent election the ap proximate percentage of votes cast for parties which stood candidates in all, or almost all, electorates, was: — Govt, parties 50% A.L.P. 40% D.L.P. 7% However, the actual seats won were: — Lib. 61 C.P. 21 A.L.P. 41 Ind. 1 Tefal 124 Under the PR system, con sidering these results alone, , the Government parties would be entitled to only about 61 seats the ALP about 49 seats, the DLP to 8 or 9 seats. However, the Communist Party average of primary votes in the 16 seats it contested was approximately 3.3%. Under the PR system, even a .83% share in the vote would secure one seat in the House of Represent atives as it is now constituted. The CPA, standing in all elec torates, could thus be expected to secure a foothold in the House under the PR system. DLP role Allocation of preferences in swinging seats has shown clear ly the anti-labor role played by the DLP. In Lalor, held for 17 years for Labor by Mr. R. T. Pollard, he secured 42 per cent of the primary votes, being then 16,000 ahead of Lee (Lib.) his closest rival. However, there were four other candidates. The DLP can didate provided 60 per cent of preferences, and of all prefer ences, 89 per cent went to the Liberal, who won by a mere 1400. In Batman (Vic), the ALP candidate Anderson was 6000 primary votes ahead of sitting member Benson, standing as an independent after having been expelled from the ALP for re fusing to dissociate himself from a public anti-ALP stand on foreign policy. In this case, the DLP altered its standing rule of giving pre ferences to the Government can didate; 90% of DLP preferences went to Benson, revealing the essential DLP anti-ALP line, as its means of assisting the Holt Government.
