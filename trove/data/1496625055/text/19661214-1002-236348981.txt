 Lake Tyers inquiry MELBOURNE: After many years of struggle by Aborigines and organisations in terested in Aboriginal diTcuirSj LUG /\DoriginGS Welfare Board has ap proved the recom mendations of the Committee of Inquiry into the future of Lake Tyers as an Aboriginal reserve. The scheme now depends on the Victorian Government's wiumgness to provide me funds. It is considered likely that it will do so. The policy of the Bolte Gov ernment has involved the set ting up .of homes (often sub standard) for Aborigines in the general community. This, policy has failed. Then the decision was taken to compel Aborigines to leave Lake Tyers and fend for them selves outside. As the policy now adopted by the Welfare Board is a complete reversal of Lib- eral Party policy, there are sure to be diehards in the Bolte Government who will resist to the last. Public pressure will be needed until the Government is obliged to take the final step 1 of adopting the scheme. 1
