 US REBUFFS PEACE MOVES BY U THANT MNITED Nations Secretary-General, U- Thant, last week described as substantially accurate a re port that the United States twice rebuffed attempts by him to arrange peace talks with North Vietnam. Columnist Emmet John Hughes in "News Week" mag azine said the US turned down a meeting with an envoy of H. Chi Minh at an undecided place and later at ambassad orial level in Rangoon in 1964. Hughes wrote that U Thant delivered a message through the Soviet Union to President Ho Chi Minh asking if he. was agreeable to an unofficial dis cussion. He replied that he was pre pared to send an envoy to meet a US representative. The reply from Washington was that its soundings in Hanoi through Canadian sources had showed that Ho Chi Mi,hh was not interested in talking peace. U Thant thought this un reasonable since, if Ho Chi Minh wanted private talks he could not be expected to tell this to Canadian inquirers, Hughes wrote. Then U Thant arranged talks between American and North Vietnamese ambassadors in Rangoon, but Washington again rejected the plan on grounds that rumors of such a meeting might topple the Saigon Gov ernment. After five months of striving U Thant told North Vietnam that his attempts had failed, Hughes says. American bombing raids on North Vietnam started 24 hours after his message reached Hanoi. The American - State Depart ment has declined to comment on the report.
