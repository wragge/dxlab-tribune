 Golf is so | good for | you QPORTSMEN who think they can get what they | need fitness-wise from a j round or two of golf should think again. According to Dr. Leroy I Getchell's findings (in a | j recent issue of The Med- 1 ical Tribune), golf pro- | vides about as much physical exercise as that derived from watching TV— nil. Dr. Getchell, a univer sity professor of physical education, studied three groups of men in their late thirties. One group engaged in vigorous physical exercise, another comprised four- rounds-a-week golfers and ! the third were home lay- $ abouts, whose main inter- j est lay in watching T.V. I j Tests in the groups for | breathing, heart rate, 1 blood pressure and oxy- B gen consumption, showed j the physical fitness fob lowers to be hands down 1 winners. There was noth 'j ing to pick between goi fers and Iounge-abouts. As though adding insuL to injury Dr. Getchell con- i eludes by saying that golf is an exercise in futility. However, whether exer cise or not golf is certainly a popular game— and one | that can be very financial- I ly rewarding, as shown by 1 Bruce Devlins' success, 1 In the article, Bruce's B wife Gloria says: "Every- I thing we have we owe to Bruce's golf . . ." The "everything" in cludes a beautiful home cn the shore of Lake Burley Griffin in Canberra, that was consolidated by Bruce three months ago when he picked up a cheque for $31,250 for winning the Carling world title.
