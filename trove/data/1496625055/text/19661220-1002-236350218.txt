 To all, our hearty 1 thanks— now for '67 By June Mills THE first issue of Tribune in 1967 will incorporate the Guardian (Mel bourne) and Guardian (Queensland). The paper will go to readers in every Australian state. For the year 1967 our aim will be a target of $10,000 for Tribune Fund. Such a. high target will not be easy to reach, but we are confident that all \Vho have supported Tri bune Fund over the years and those who have do nated to the two Guard ians will rally to our as sistance and send us liberal donations each week. To readers in other States — West and South Australia and Tasmania — we will be making a special appeal for aid. For this week we didn't get the donations needed to give us the bonus of $20i0, but one reason might . well be that we had to close the books early, owing to going to press a day earlier than usual. So there will surely be more to be acknowledged in January. Special thanks to our many readers who have helped so substantially over the past 12 months. Thanks also to the many who have sent messages of good-will to me, including my old friend J.K., who wrote "wishing you every success in your efforts to finance Tribune so that readers get the truth be hind the 'news'."
