 [?] With Tribune's Industrial | Roundsman || "THE Minister for Labor, | Mr. Bury, attacking f the Qantas pilots last J week tried to sell them | the "virtues" of arbitra- f tion . . . "they have no I reason to fear arbitration," J he said. j It must be narking the cam- $ pany and Government that the | pilots pulled out of the clutches | of the Arbitration Commission | and its penal powers years ago. I I ONLY last week the Boiler- | makers and Blacksmiths' is Society was fined $12,000 plus 3 SI, 000 costs by the Arbitration J Court because 27 boilermakers ;' didn't want to work overtime :j on one particular night. h , This firm, C. A. Parsons of | Whyalla, South Australia, have ?j been working their men a 52 jl hour week for the past 20 years. j A fortnight ago a worker who \ was sick on Friday turned up j for work on the Saturday but | the company refused him a | start. j This is the other side of the | arbitration penny! , I mHE South Coast unions i united campaign to make t the BHP's steelworks (AI & S) | a 100 per cent union shop has U netted hundreds of new mem- bers. | But as union officials say, the | unionising of this monopoly is a continuous process because ) of the size of the works ancl ; labor turnover. Show card days will com- j mence again early next Feb- > ruary and so will the campaign j for increased wages. s ? i PREMIER Askin now tells jj the NSW Labor Council jj that the Public Service Board | "as a responsible body, can- 5 not grant increases" to the | Maritime Sendees Board wor- &lt; kers who are campaigning for | a service increment scheme. s The unions were meeting (| last week to discuss this latest f fob-off. I I A S the festive season ap- ;| proaches, a few well earn- ed noggins are being sunk | throughout the labor movement. g Several unions have already organised smokos and functions | for their union delegates These men and women are un- paid, hard working backbone gj of the trade union movement | and should be appreciated ana honoured much more than at s present. Another big year is coming up, so keep (reasonably) sober! Best wishes for the season. Â£ Be seeing you early in the New g Year. W
