 m m THE WEAR — IMF MS am nonmnnm aim i ! AND what a year it was. Plenty to keep those who wanted ii to make Australia a better place on the go all the i time. In the midst of "affluence", prices soared, wages trailed further, the arms vote leapt and, even on the admission 01 its J defenders, the economy is turning the year in a sluggish j state. But it was Vietnam that dominated the year : Holt blackened our name in Asia by sending conscripts i to America's war of aggression, then crawled before Johnson ji at the White House (and in Canberra) with his "All the j Way" pledge. Back home, he got the answer he j1 deserved: thousands of people showed their opposition to , ! his policy of betrayal, culminating in the massive demonstrations | that greeted LBJ. With an expert use of the "big lie" J technique, Holt got back home in the Federal Elections, but fj split the nation down the middle in the process ... So f here they are — some of the highlights ( and lowlights) of 1966: HH|M|||H||||||||aH1|||||||| [?] t . : ; RUN-AWAY WINNER in a very strong 'jl j field for the cherished Pineapple of the iyear was none other than Harold (Top per) Holt.

Deaas a&orsHall, we salute you! DISCARD OF THE YEAR. Former West German Chancellor Ludwig Erhard: No one to coalesce with. FATHER OF THE YEAR. Federal financial mudcV.er "Little Billy" McMahon, at an age when most men are thinking of higher things. We take back some of those nasty things we said about you, Billy. PENSIONER OF THE YEAR. That's right — our late and un- lamented Prime Minister, who got out while the going was good and started touring the States collecting honorary degrees from obscure Mid-Western Universi ties. When last heard of, was down to his last handful of thistles. BOO-BOOB OF THE YEAR. That security document which mysteriously came into the pos- ! session of its subject Francis j James (see below). Snedden and I Holt chased their tails denying it, but we'll take London to a brick it was the genuine article. MAVERICK OF THE YEAR. Non-conformist Francis James (right), who made Ed Clark see red when he went to see North Vietnam for himself, blew the gaff (twice) on the Government's plans to increase its Vietnam force, and, to cap it all, got very inefficiently spied upon by Spry.
