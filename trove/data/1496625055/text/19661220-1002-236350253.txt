 Heated pool A STEADY flow of people are joining the Heated Pool Committee which a number of us, parents of asthmatic children, set up on November 22 to campaign for a year-round heated pool cen- wmmm - - trally placed in Sydney for !, j children, including asthmatic //„ On and other handicapped child- f ren. Membership is open to all citizens who support the ob- jects of the committee on the - j payment of a fee of 20 cents. The best form of therapy MM for asthmatics is swimming. A heated pool would permit |p| continuity. |f$| The Asthma Welfare So- Mm ciety does an excellent job in teaching children to swim gp|jf with voluntary instructors and i/,, private pools, but is unable ||p| to cope with the numbers. /' J Our committee takes the. view that no child should be denied the right to treatment through ' ;! lack of facilities. p The City Council has two pools at present in Sydney £' 'i (both cold) at . Prince Alfred Park and Victoria Park. Nei- 4 ther has a children's pool. j The Health and Recreation J$|;| Committee of the City Coun- cil has recently recommended, W0 the heating of the present |p?| pool at Victoria Park. tY J We are proposing that the children's pool should also be H$| there so that the same heat- |||| ing equipment may be used. ! ' i Wei have applied to the ?/\ Sydney City council for its |||| construction and have re- Kgj quested that the Council's |p| Health and Recreation Com- !; mittee meet a deputation. We appeal to those in auth- ority, to all organisations and ' citizens of goodwill, to sup- 1 : .port us morally in our efforts pf| to have established the neces sary facilities for our child- ren and all other children that require these facilities. v$j') Write and let the Sydney City Council know your views- ||||; — J.
