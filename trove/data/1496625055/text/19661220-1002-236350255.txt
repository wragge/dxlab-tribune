 Sordid film ,fpHE Moving Target", an American film in which Paul Newman stars portrays the worst acts of violence — murder, torture, kidnapping. narcotics — is in my opinion unsuitable for general exhibi tion. My main reason for draw ing readers' attention to this film is that on November 30 when I attended Gosford theatre to see it, some 40 boys ranging in. age from 14 to 18 years were present. I'hese boys were from the Mt. Penang Training School, Gosford, which is a corrective institution where boys are sent after having been dealt with by the court for breaches of the law. I have no criticism of the general conduct of this insti tution but believe that allow ing these boys to view this anti-social film is to be deplor ed, as it could surely not as sist them to overcome their resentment to society which had caused them to be sent to Mt. ' Penang in the first place. I would estimate that there were only about 15 to 20 other patrons at this film, an indica tion of people's feelings about the sordid picture. Geo. Mulholland, Newcastle.
