 A hanging Xmas A RE we going to challenge the hanging of Ryan or enjoy our Xmas festivities without a thought to the seri ousness of capital punish- ment? I am not protecting the criminal but our fast dimin ishing human decency towards human life. Also are we not condoning another murder by hiring a hangman? If we are to retain any remnants of civilisation let us join the honest people who are laising their voices in pro test against this medieval practice. If we do nothing we must take some of the blame. Rose Keith, Vaucluse (NSW).
