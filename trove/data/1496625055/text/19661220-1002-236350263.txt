 Happy Xmas from the boss JITHGOW: Dismissal notices, to come into effect on Christmas Eve, were served on 37 miners last week at the Lithgow Valley colliery, west of Sydney. Miners' Federation general president, Mr. W. Parkinson, condemned the proposed sackings as "one of the most ruthless actions by any mining company for several years". He said that one of the men being sacked has been on the company's staff for 42 years. Leaders of the Federation last week conferred with the Joint Coal Board and the State Member for Hartley (Mr. H. Coates) in an effort to prevent the sackings or have them postponed. The Board assured the Federation that it would seek coal orders from Australian Iron and Steel and the NSW Electricity Commission to stop the sackings. Mr. Parkinson told the Board that the notices could be deferred for at least two months past Christmas. He said the men would have at least an average of 30 days accu mulated sick leave which has been put aside by the company and paid for. "Instead of the company pocketing this money, it should be used to keep the men on until a solution is found", he said.
