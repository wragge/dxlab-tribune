 1 5,000 stop work, march AA ELBOURNE : Over 15,000 building workers stopped work here on December 15 and over 7,000 marched through main city streets to the Trades Hall and later to Parliament House. They were protesting against employers' opposition to their claims for increased fares and travelling allowances. They were also expressing the hostility to an officer of the Victorian Public Service acting as chief advocate for all em ployers' opposing the claims. After walking off jobs in various city and suburban locations the marching workers converged on the Trades Hall and later despite pouring rain they marched to Parliament House. They swept aside a line of police and attendants and stormed up the steps to the main entrance. Later a deputation from the building workers met the Lead er of the Labor Opposition, Mr. Stoneham. He promised to raise in Parliament the use of public servants as advocates for private employers.
