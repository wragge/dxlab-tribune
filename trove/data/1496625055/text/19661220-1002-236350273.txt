 IbasisforI PEACE IN VIETNAM '"JHE renewed United States bombing of Hanoi and the anticipated decision of the Holt Gov ernment to send more Aus- tralian troops to Vietnam is a grim reminder of the continuing escalation of the war," said Mr. L. | Aarons, general secretary | of the Communist Party 1 of Australia, in a letter 1 to the press this week. | Both sides will observe I a cease-fire over the Christmas and New Year holidays. It is a matter of the greatest urgency that a new initiative for peace in Vietnam should be undertaken. "To this end the US bombing of North Viet nam should cease. The basis for peace talks should be observance of the Geneva Agreement of 1954. Opportunity "Such talks can be real istic and effective only if the National Liberation Front of South Vietna-m is a party to them, and the opportunity exists for the Australian Government to take a real initiative for peace, sponsoring such a proposal. "The National Libera tion Front of South Viet nam was formed on De cember 20, 1960, ad is now celebrating its sixth anniversary. It is, with out question, a representa tive and powerful force. "More than two-thirds of the territory of South Vietnam is under its ad ministration and most Vietnamese in the South accept its leadership. "It is essential, there fore, that the National Liberation Front have an integral place in any ne gotiations for peace," the letter concluded.
